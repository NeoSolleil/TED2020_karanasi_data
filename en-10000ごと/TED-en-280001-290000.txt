In reality, everyone is capable of creating their own masterpiece.
You should try it sometime.
It's quite fun.
Thank you.
(Applause and cheers)
Hello. Actually, that's "hello" in Bauer Bodoni for the typographically hysterical amongst us.
One of the threads that seems to have come through loud and clear in the last couple of days is this need to reconcile what the Big wants -- the "Big" being the organization, the system, the country -- and what the "Small" wants -- the individual, the person.
And how do you bring those two things together?
Charlie Ledbetter, yesterday, I thought, talked very articulately about this need to bring consumers, to bring people into the process of creating things.
And that's what I want to talk about today.
So, bringing together the Small to help facilitate and create the Big, I think, is something that we believe in -- something I believe in, and something that we kind of bring to life through what we do at Ideo.
I call this first chapter -- for the Brits in the room -- the "Blinding Glimpse of the Bleeding Obvious."
Often, the good ideas are so staring-at-you-right-in-the-face that you kind of miss them. And I think, a lot of times, what we do is just, sort of, hold the mirror up to our clients, and sort of go, "Duh! You know, look what's really going on."
And rather than talk about it in the theory, I think I'm just going to show you an example.
We were asked by a large healthcare system in Minnesota to describe to them what their patient experience was.
And I think they were expecting -- they'd worked with lots of consultants before -- I think they were expecting some kind of hideous org chart with thousands of bubbles and systemic this, that and the other, and all kinds of mappy stuff.
Or even worse, some kind of ghastly death-by-Powerpoint thing with WowCharts and all kinds of, you know, God knows, whatever.
The first thing we actually shared with them was this.
I'll play this until your eyeballs completely dissolve.
This is 59 seconds into the film.
This is a minute 59.
3:19.
I think something happens. I think a head may appear in a second.
5:10.
5:58.
6:20.
We showed them the whole cut, and they were all completely, what is this?
And the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day, all you do is look at the roof, and it's a really shitty experience.
And just putting yourself in the position of the patient -- this is Christian, who works with us at Ideo.
He just lay in the hospital bed, and, kind of, stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles for a really long time.
That's what it's like to be a patient in the hospital.
And they were sort, you know, blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious.
Oh, my goodness. So, looking at the situation from the point of view of the person out -- as opposed to the traditional position of the organization in -- was, for these guys, quite a revelation.
And so, that was a really catalytic thing for them.
So they snapped into action.
They said, OK, it's not about systemic change.
It's not about huge, ridiculous things that we need to do.
It's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference.
So we started with them prototyping some really little things that we could do to have a huge amount of impact.
The first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror and we Band-Aided it here, onto a gurney, a hospital trolley, so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor, you could actually have a conversation with them.
You could, kind of, see them in your rear-view mirror, so it created a tiny human interaction.
Very small example of something that they could do.
Interestingly, the nurses themselves, sort of, snapped into action -- said, OK, we embrace this. What can we do?
The first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling.
Which I thought was really -- I showed this to my mother recently.
I think my mother now thinks that I'm some sort of interior decorator.
It's what I do for a living, sort of Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen.
Not particularly the world's best design solution for those of us who are real, sort of, hard-core designers, but nonetheless, a fabulous empathic solution for people.
Things that they started doing themselves -- like changing the floor going into the patient's room so that it signified, "This is my room. This is my personal space" -- was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem.
So you went from public space to private space.
And another idea, again, that came from one of the nurses -- which I love -- was they took traditional, sort of, corporate white boards, then they put them on one wall of the patient's room, and they put this sticker there.
So that what you could actually do was go into the room and write messages to the person who was sick in that room, which was lovely.
So, tiny, tiny, tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact.
I thought that was a really, really nice example.
So this is not particularly a new idea, kind of, seeing opportunities in things that are around you and snapping and turning them into a solution.
It's a history of invention based around this.
I'm going to read this because I want to get these names right.
Joan Ganz Cooney saw her daughter -- came down on a Saturday morning, saw her daughter watching the test card, waiting for programs to come on one morning and from that came Sesame Street.
Malcolm McLean was moving from one country to another and was wondering why it took these guys so long to get the boxes onto the ship.
And he invented the shipping container.
George de Mestral -- this is not bugs all over a Birkenstock -- was walking his dog in a field and got covered in burrs, sort of little prickly things, and from that came Velcro.
And finally, for the Brits, Percy Shaw -- this is a big British invention -- saw the cat's eyes at the side of the road, when he was driving home one night and from that came the Catseye.
So there's a whole series of just using your eyes, seeing things for the first time, seeing things afresh and using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities.
Second one, without sounding overly Zen, and this is a quote from the Buddha: "Finding yourself in the margins, looking to the edges of things, is often a really interesting place to start."
Blinkered vision tends to produce, I think, blinkered solutions.
So, looking wide, using your peripheral vision, is a really interesting place to look for opportunity.
Again, another medical example here.
We were asked by a device producer -- we did the Palm Pilot and the Treo.
We did a lot of sexy tech at Ideo -- they'd seen this and they wanted a sexy piece of technology for medical diagnostics.
This was a device that a nurse uses when they're doing a spinal procedure in hospital.
They'll ask the nurses to input data.
And they had this vision of the nurse, kind of, clicking away on this aluminum device and it all being incredibly, sort of, gadget-lustish.
When we actually went and watched this procedure taking place -- and I'll explain this in a second -- it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this that they really weren't recognizing.
When you're having a four-inch needle inserted into your spine -- which was the procedure that this device's data was about; it was for pain management -- you're shit scared; you're freaking out.
And so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did, was hold the patient's hand to comfort them. Human gesture -- which made the fabulous two-handed data input completely impossible.
So, the thing that we designed, much less sexy but much more human and practical, was this.
So, it's not a Palm Pilot by any stretch of the imagination, but it has a thumb-scroll so you can do everything with one hand.
So, again, going back to this -- the idea that a tiny human gesture dictated the design of this product.
And I think that's really, really important.
So, again, this idea of workarounds.
We use this phrase "workarounds" a lot, sort of, looking around us. I was actually looking around the TED and just watching all of these kind of things happen while I've been here.
This idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life -- and the things we kind of do in our environment that are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential -- is something that we look at a lot.
We wrote a book recently, I think you might have received it, called "Thoughtless Acts?"
It's been all about these kind of thoughtless things that people do, which have huge intention and huge opportunity.
Why do we all follow the line in the street?
This is a picture in a Japanese subway.
People consciously follow things even though, why, we don't know.
Why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence?
Because we kind of have to -- we're just compelled to.
We don't know why, but we do.
Why do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle?
Again, we're sort of using the world around us to create our own design solutions.
And we're always saying to our clients: "You should look at this stuff.
This stuff is really important. This stuff is really vital."
This is people designing their own experiences.
You can draw from this.
We sort of assume that because there's a pole in the street, that it's okay to use it, so we park our shopping cart there.
It's there for our use, on some level.
So, again, we sort of co-opt our environment to do all these different things.
We co-opt other experiences -- we take one item and transfer it to another.
And this is my favorite one. My mother used to say to me, "Just because your sister jumps in the lake doesn't mean you have to."
But, of course, we all do. We all follow each other every day.
So somebody assumes that because somebody else has done something, that's permission for them to do the same thing.
And there's almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time.
I mean, shopping bag equals "parking meter out of order."
And we all, kind of, know how to read these signals now.
We all talk to one another in this highly visual way without realizing what we're doing.
Third section is this idea of not knowing, of consciously putting yourself backwards.
I talk about unthinking situations all the time.
Sort of having beginner's mind, scraping your mind clean and looking at things afresh.
A friend of mine was a designer at IKEA, and he was asked by his boss to help design a storage system for children.
This is the Billy bookcase -- it's IKEA's biggest selling product.
Hammer it together. Hammer it together with a shoe, if you're me, because they're impossible to assemble.
But big selling bookcase. How do we replicate this for children?
The reality is when you actually watch children, children don't think about things like storage in linear terms.
Children assume permission in a very different way.
Children live on things. They live under things.
They live around things, and so their spatial awareness relationship, and their thinking around storage is totally different.
So the first thing you have to do -- this is Graham, the designer -- is, sort of, put yourself in their shoes. And so, here he is sitting under the table.
So, what came out of this?
This is the storage system that he designed.
So what is this? I hear you all ask. No, I don't.
(Laughter) It's this, and I think this is a particularly lovely solution.
So, you know, it's a totally different way of looking at the situation.
It's a completely empathic solution -- apart from the fact that teddy's probably not loving it.
(Laughter) But a really nice way of re-framing the ordinary, and I think that's one of the things.
And putting yourself in the position of the person, and I think that's one of the threads that I've heard again from this conference is how do we put ourselves in other peoples' shoes and really feel what they feel?
And then use that information to fuel solutions?
And I think that's what this is very much about.
Last section: green armband. We've all got them.
It's about this really.
I mean, it's about picking battles big enough to matter but small enough to win.
Again, that's one of the themes that I think has come through loud and clear in this conference is: Where do we start? How do we start? What do we do to start?
So, again, we were asked to design a water pump for a company called ApproTEC, in Kenya.
They're now called KickStart.
And, again, as designers, we wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful and spend a lot of time thinking of the form.
And that was completely irrelevant.
When you put yourself in the position of these people, things like the fact that this has to be able to fold up and fit on a bicycle, become much more relevant than the form of it. The way it's produced, it has to be produced with indigenous manufacturing methods and indigenous materials.
So it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the user.
We had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world.
So what seems like a very clunky product is, in fact, incredibly useful.
It's powered a bit like a Stairmaster -- you pump up and down on it.
Children can use it. Adults can use it. Everybody uses it.
It's turning these guys -- again, one of the themes -- it's turning them into entrepreneurs.
These guys are using this very successfully.
And for us, it's been great because it's won loads of design awards.
So we actually managed to reconcile the needs of the design company, the needs of the individuals in the company, to feel good about a product we were actually designing, and the needs of the individuals we were designing it for.
There it is, pumping water from 30 feet.
So as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets to all of you this morning.
We've made a donation on everybody's behalf here to kick start, no pun intended, their next project.
Because, again, I think, sort of, putting our money where our mouth is, here.
We feel that this is an important gesture.
So we've handed out bracelets. Small is the new big.
I hope you'll all wear them.
So that's it. Thank you.
(Applause)
What I thought I would talk about today is the transition from one mode of thinking about nature to another that's tracked by architecture.
What's interesting about architects is, we always have tried to justify beauty by looking to nature, and arguably, beautiful architecture has always been looking at a model of nature.
So, for roughly 300 years, the hot debate in architecture was whether the number five or the number seven was a better proportion to think about architecture, because the nose was one-fifth of your head, or because your head was one-seventh of your body.
And the reason that that was the model of beauty and of nature was because the decimal point had not been invented yet -- it wasn't the 16th century -- and everybody had to dimension a building in terms of fractions, so a room would be dimensioned as one-fourth of a facade; the structural dais of that might be dimensioned as 10 units, and you would get down to the small elements by fractional subdivision: finer and finer and finer.
In the 15th century, the decimal point was invented; architects stopped using fractions, and they had a new model of nature.
So, what's going on today is that there's a model of natural form which is calculus-based and which is using digital tools, and that has a lot of implications to the way we think about beauty and form, and it has a lot of implications in the way we think about nature.
The best example of this would probably be the Gothic, and the Gothic was invented after the invention of calculus, although the Gothic architects weren't really using calculus to define their forms.
But what was important is, the Gothic moment in architecture was the first time that force and motion was thought of in terms of form.
So, examples like Christopher Wren's King's Cross: you can see that the structural forces of the vaulting get articulated as lines, so you're really actually seeing the expression of structural force and form.
Much later, Robert Maillart's bridges, which optimize structural form with a calculus curvature almost like a parabola.
The Hanging Chain models of Antonio Gaudi, the Catalan architect.
The end of the 19th century, beginning of the 20th century, and how that Hanging Chain model translates into archways and vaulting.
So, in all of these examples, structure is the determining force.
Frei Otto was starting to use foam bubble diagrams and foam bubble models to generate his Mannheim Concert Hall.
Interestingly, in the last 10 years Norman Foster used a similar heat thermal transfer model to generate the roof of the National Gallery, with the structural engineer Chris Williams.
In all these examples, there's one ideal form, because these are thought in terms of structure.
And as an architect, I've always found these kinds of systems very limiting, because I'm not interested in ideal forms and I'm not interested in optimizing to some perfect moment.
So, what I thought I would bring up is another component that needs to be thought of, whenever you think about nature, and that's basically the invention of generic form in genetic evolution.
My hero is actually not Darwin; it's a guy named William Bateson, father of Greg Bateson, who was here for a long time in Monterey.
And he was what you'd call a teratologist: he looked at all of the monstrosities and mutations to find rules and laws, rather than looking at the norms.
So, instead of trying to find the ideal type or the ideal average, he'd always look for the exception. So, in this example, which is an example of what's called Bateson's Rule, he has two kinds of mutations of a human thumb.
When I first saw this image, 10 years ago, I actually found it very strange and beautiful at the same time.
Beautiful, because it has symmetry.
So, what he found is that in all cases of thumb mutations, instead of having a thumb, you would either get another opposable thumb, or you would get four fingers.
So, the mutations reverted to symmetry.
And Bateson invented the concept of symmetry breaking, which is that wherever you lose information in a system, you revert back to symmetry.
So, symmetry wasn't the sign of order and organization -- which is what I was always understanding, and as is an architect -- symmetry was the absence of information.
So, whenever you lost information, you'd move to symmetry; whenever you added information to a system, you would break symmetry.
So, this whole idea of natural form shifted at that moment from looking for ideal shapes to looking for a combination of information and generic form.
You know, literally after seeing that image, and finding out what Bateson was working with, we started to use these rules for symmetry breaking and branching to start to think about architectural form.
To just talk for a minute about the digital mediums that we're using now and how they integrate calculus: the fact that they're calculus-based means that we don't have to think about dimension in terms of ideal units or discreet elements.
So, in architecture we deal with big assemblies of components, so there might be up to, say, 50,000 pieces of material in this room you're sitting in right now that all need to get organized.
Now, typically you'd think that they would all be the same: like, the chairs you're sitting in would all be the same dimension.
You know, I haven't verified this, but it's the norm that every chair would be a slightly different dimension, because you'd want to space them all out for everybody's sight lines.
The elements that make up the ceiling grid and the lighting, they're all losing their modular quality, and moving more and more to these infinitesimal dimensions.
That's because we're all using calculus tools for manufacturing and for design.
Calculus is also a mathematics of curves.
So, even a straight line, defined with calculus, is a curve.
It's just a curve without inflection.
So, a new vocabulary of form is now pervading all design fields: whether it's automobiles, architecture, products, etc., it's really being affected by this digital medium of curvature.
The intricacies of scale that come out of that -- you know, in the example of the nose to the face, there's a fractional part-to-whole idea.
With calculus, the whole idea of subdivision is more complex, because the whole and the parts are one continuous series.
It's too early in the morning for a lecture on calculus, so I brought some images to just describe how that works.
This is a Korean church that we did in Queens.
And in this example, you can see that the components of this stair are repetitive, but they're repetitive without being modular.
Each one of the elements in this structure is a unique distance and dimension, and all of the connections are unique angles.
Now, the only way we could design that, or possibly construct it, is by using a calculus-based definition of the form.
It also is much more dynamic, so that you can see that the same form opens and closes in a very dynamic way as you move across it, because it has this quality of vector in motion built into it.
So the same space that appears to be a kind of closed volume, when seen from the other side becomes a kind of open vista.
And you also get a sense of visual movement in the space, because every one of the elements is changing in a pattern, so that pattern leads your eye towards the altar.
I think that's one of the main changes, also, in architecture: that we're starting to look now not for some ideal form, like a Latin cross for a church, but actually all the traits of a church: so, light that comes from behind from an invisible source, directionality that focuses you towards an altar.
It turns out it's not rocket science to design a sacred space.
You just need to incorporate a certain number of traits in a very kind of genetic way.
So, these are the different perspectives of that interior, which has a very complex set of orientations all in a simple form.
In terms of construction and manufacturing, this is a kilometer-long housing block that was built in the '70s in Amsterdam.
And here we've broken the 500 apartments up into small neighborhoods, and differentiated those neighborhoods.
I won't go into too much description of any of these projects, but what you can see is that the escalators and elevators that circulate people along the face of the building are all held up by 122 structural trusses.
Because we're using escalators to move people, all of these trusses are picking up diagonal loads.
So, every one of them is a little bit different-shaped as you move down the length of the building.
So, working with Bentley and MicroStation, we've written a custom piece of software that networks all of the components together into these chunks of information, so that if we change any element along the length of the building, not only does that change distribute through each one of the trusses, but each one of the trusses then distributes that information down the length of the entire facade of the building.
So it's a single calculation for every single component of the building that we're adding onto.
So, it's tens of millions of calculations just to design one connection between a piece of structural steel and another piece of structural steel.
But what it gives us is a harmonic and synthesized relationship of all these components, one to another.
This idea has, kind of, brought me into doing some product design, and it's because design firms that have connections to architects, like, I'm working with Vitra, which is a furniture company, and Alessi, which is a houseware company.
They saw this actually solving a problem: this ability to differentiate components but keep them synthetic.
So, not to pick on BMW, or to celebrate them, but take BMW as an example.
They have to, in 2005, have a distinct identity for all their models of cars.
So, the 300 series, or whatever their newest car is, the 100 series that's coming out, has to look like the 700 series, at the other end of their product line, so they need a distinct, coherent identity, which is BMW.
At the same time, there's a person paying 30,000 dollars for a 300-series car, and a person paying 70,000 dollars for a 700 series, and that person paying more than double doesn't want their car to look too much like the bottom-of-the-market car.
So they have to also discriminate between these products.
So, as manufacturing starts to allow more design options, this problem gets exacerbated, of the whole and the parts.
Now, as an architect, part-to-whole relationships is all I think about, but in terms of product design it's becoming more and more of an issue for companies.
So, the first kind of test product we did was with Alessi, which was for a coffee and tea set.
It's an incredibly expensive coffee and tea set; we knew that at the beginning. So, I actually went to some people I knew down south in San Diego, and we used an exploded titanium forming method that's used in the aerospace industry.
Basically what we can do, is just cut a graphite mold, put it in an oven, heat it to 1,000 degrees, gently inflate titanium that's soft, and then explode it at the last minute into this form.
But what's great about it is, the forms are only a few hundred dollars.
The titanium's several thousand dollars, but the forms are very cheap.
So, we designed a system here of eight curves that could be swapped, very similar to that housing project I showed you, and we could recombine those together, so that we always had ergonomic shapes that always had the same volume and could always be produced in the same way.
That way, each one of these tools we could pay for with a few hundred dollars, and get incredible variation in the components.
And this is one of those examples of the sets.
So, for me, what was important is that this coffee set -- which is just a coffee pot, a teapot, and those are the pots sitting on a tray -- that they would have a coherence -- so, they would be Greg Lynn Alessi coffee pots -- but that everyone who bought one would have a one-of-a-kind object that was unique in some way.
To go back to architecture, what's organic about architecture as a field, unlike product design, is this whole issue of holism and of monumentality is really our realm.
Like, we have to design things which are coherent as a single object, but also break down into small rooms and have an identity of both the big scale and the small scale.
Architects tend to work with signature, so that an architect needs a signature and that signature has to work across the scale of houses up to, say, skyscrapers, and that problem of signatures is a thing we're very good at maintaining and working with; and intricacy, which is the relationship of, say, the shape of a building, its structure, its windows, its color, its pattern. These are real architectural problems.
So, my kind of hero for this in the natural world are these tropical frogs.
I got interested in them because they're the most extreme example of a surface where the texture and the -- let's call it the decoration -- I know the frog doesn't think of it as decoration, but that's how it works -- are all intricately connected to one another.
So a change in the form indicates a change in the color pattern.
So, the pattern and the form aren't the same thing, but they really work together and are fused in some way.
So, when doing a center for the national parks in Costa Rica, we tried to use that idea of a gradient color and a change in texture as the structure moves across the surface of the building.
We also used a continuity of change from a main exhibition hall to a natural history museum, so it's all one continuous change in the massing, but within that massing are very different kinds of spaces and forms.
In a housing project in Valencia, Spain, we're doing, the different towers of housing fused together in shared curves so you get a single mass, like a kind of monolith, but it breaks down into individual elements.
And you can see that that change in massing also gives all 48 of the apartments a unique shape and size, but always within a, kind of, controlled limit, an envelope of change.
I work with a group of other architects.
We have a company called United Architects.
We were one of the finalists for the World Trade Center site design.
And I think this just shows how we were approaching the problem of incredibly large-scale construction.
We wanted to make a kind of Gothic cathedral around the footprints of the World Trade Center site.
And to do that, we tried to connect up the five towers into a single system.
And we looked at, from the 1950s on, there were numerous examples of other architects trying to do the same thing.
We really approached it at the level of the typology of the building, where we could build these five separate towers, but they would all join at the 60th floor and make a kind of single monolithic mass.
With United Architects, also, we made a proposal for the European Central Bank headquarters that used the same system, but this time in a much more monolithic mass, like a sphere.
But again, you can see this, kind of, organic fusion of multiple building elements to make a thing which is whole, but breaks down into smaller parts, but in an incredibly organic way.
Finally, I'd like to just show you some of the effects of using digital fabrication.
About six years ago, I bought one of these CNC mills, to just replace, kind of, young people cutting their fingers off all the time building models.
And I also bought a laser cutter and started to fabricate within my own shop, kind of, large-scale building elements and models, where we could go directly to the tooling.
What I found out is that the tooling, if you intervened in the software, actually produced decorative effects.
So, for these interiors, like this shop in Stockholm, Sweden, or this installation wall in the Netherlands at the Netherlands Architecture Institute, we could use the texture that the tool would leave to produce a lot of the spatial effects, and we could integrate the texture of the wall with the form of the wall with the material.
So, in vacuum-formed plastic, in fiberglass, and then even at the level of structural steel, which you think of as being linear and modular.
The steel industry is so far ahead of the design industry that if you take advantage of it you can even start to think of beams and columns all rolled together into a single system which is highly efficient, but also produces decorative effects and formal effects that are very beautiful and organic.
Thanks very much.
I was listed on the online biography that said I was a design missionary.
That's a bit lofty; I'm really more of something like a street walker.
I spend a lot of time in urban areas looking for design, and studying design in the public sector.
I take about 5,000 photographs a year, and I thought that I would edit from these, and try to come up with some images that might be appropriate and interesting to you.
And I used three criteria: the first was, I thought I'd talk about real design within reach, design that's free, not design not quite within reach, as we're fondly known by our competition and competitors, but stuff that you can find on the streets, stuff that was free, stuff that was available to all people, and stuff that probably contains some other important messages.
I'll use these sidewalks in Rio as an example.
A very common public design done in the '50s.
It's got a nice kind of flowing, organic form, very consistent with the Brazilian culture -- I think good design adds to culture.
Wholly inconsistent with San Francisco or New York.
But I think these are my sort of information highways: I live in much more of an analog world, where pedestrian traffic and interaction and diversity exchange, and where I think the simple things under our feet have a great amount of meaning to us.
How did I get started in this business?
I was a ceramic designer for about 10 years, and just loved utilitarian form -- simple things that we use every day, little compositions of color and surface on form.
This led me to starting a company called Design Within Reach, a company dealing with simple forms, making good designers available to us, and also selling the personalities and character of the designers as well, and it seems to have worked.
A couple of years into the process, I spent a lot of time in Europe traveling around, looking for design.
And I had a bit of a wake-up call in Amsterdam: I was there going into the design stores, and mixing with our crowd of designers, and I recognized that a whole lot of stuff pretty much looked the same, and the effect of globalization has had that in our community also.
We know a lot about what's going on with design around the world, and it's getting increasingly more difficult to find design that reflects a unique culture.
I was walking around on the streets of Amsterdam and I recognized, you know, the big story from Amsterdam isn't what's in the design stores, it's what's out on the streets, and maybe it's self-explanatory, but a city that hasn't been taken over by modernism, that's preserved its kind of architecture and character, and where the bicycle plays an important part of the way in which people get around and where pedestrian rights are protected.
And I write a newsletter that goes out every week, and I wrote an article about this, and it got such enormous response that I realized that design, that common design, that's in the public area means a lot to people, and establishes kind of a groundwork and a dialog.
I then kind of thought about the other cities in Europe where I spend a lot of time looking for design, like Basel, where Vitra is located, or in northern Italy -- all cities where there are a whole lot of bicycles, and where pedestrian areas -- and I came to the conclusion that perhaps there was something about these important design centers that dealt with bicycles and foot traffic, and I'm sure the skeptic eye would say, no, the correlation there is that there are universities and schools where people can't afford cars, but it did seem that in many of these areas pedestrian traffic was protected.
You wouldn't look at this and call this a designer bike: a designer bike is made of titanium or molybdenum.
But I began looking at design in a place like Amsterdam and recognized, you know, the first job of design is to serve a social purpose.
And so I look at this bike as not being a designer bike, but being a very good example of design.
And since that time in Amsterdam, I spent an increasing amount of time in the cities, looking at design for common evidence of design that really isn't under so much of a designer's signature.
I was in Buenos Aires very recently, and I went to see this bridge by Santiago Calatrava.
He's a Spanish architect and designer.
And the tourist brochures pointed me in the direction of this bridge -- I love bridges, metaphorically and symbolically and structurally -- and it was a bit of a disappointment, because of the sludge from the river was encrusted on it; it really wasn't in use.
And I recognized that oftentimes design, when you're set up to see design, it can be a bit of a letdown.
But there were lots of other things going on in this area: it was a kind of construction zone; a lot of buildings were going up.
And, approaching a building from a distance, you don't see too much; you get a little closer, and you arrive at a nice little composition that might remind you of a Mondrian or a Diebenkorn or something.
But to me it was an example of industrial materials with a little bit of colors and animation and a nice little still life -- kind of unintended piece of design.
And going a little closer, you get a different perspective.
I find these little vignettes, these little accidental pieces of design, to be refreshing.
They give me, I don't know, a sense of correctness in the world and some visual delight in the knowledge that the building will probably never look as good as this simple industrial scaffolding that is there to serve.
Down the road, there was another building, a nice visual structure: horizontal, vertical elements, little decorative lines going across, these magenta squiggles, the workmen being reduced to decorative elements, just a nice, kind of, breakup of the urban place.
And, you know, that no longer exists.
You've captured it for a moment, and finding this little still life's like listening to little songs or something: it gives me an enormous amount of pleasure.
Antoine Predock designed a wonderful ball stadium in San Diego called Petco Park.
A terrific use of local materials, but inside you could find some interior compositions.
Some people go to baseball stadiums to look at games; I go and see design relationships.
Just a wonderful kind of breakup of architecture, and the way that the trees form vertical elements.
Red is a color in the landscape that is often on stop signs.
It takes your attention; it has a great amount of emotion; it stares back at you the way that a figure might.
Just a piece of barrier tape construction stuff in Italy.
Construction site in New York: red having this kind of emotional power that's almost an equivalent with the way in which -- cuteness of puppies and such.
Side street in Italy.
Red drew me into this little composition, optimistic to me in the sense that maybe the public service's mailbox, door service, plumbing.
It looks as if these different public services work together to create some nice little compositions.
In Italy, you know, almost everything, kind of, looks good.
Simple menus put on a board, achieving, kind of, the sort of balance.
But I'm convinced that it's because you're walking around the streets and seeing things.
Red can be comical: it can draw your attention to the poor little personality of the little fire hydrant suffering from bad civic planning in Havana.
Color can animate simple blocks, simple materials: walking in New York, I'll stop.
I don't always know why I take photographs of things.
A nice visual composition of symmetry.
Curves against sharp things.
It's a comment on the way in which we deal with public seating in the city of New York.
I've come across some other just, kind of, curious relationships of bollards on the street that have different interpretations, but -- these things amuse me.
Sometimes a trash can -- this is just in the street in San Francisco -- a trash can that's been left there for 18 months creates a nice 45-degree angle against these other relationships, and turns a common parking spot into a nice little piece of sculpture.
So, there's this sort of silent hand of design at work that I see in places that I go.
Havana is a wonderful area.
It's quite free of commercial clutter: you don't see our logos and brands and names, and therefore you're alert to things physically.
And this is a great protection of a pedestrian zone, and the repurposing of some colonial cannons to do that.
And Cuba needs to be far more resourceful, because of the blockades and things, but a really wonderful playground.
I've often wondered why Italy is really a leader in modern design.
In our area, in furnishings, they're sort of way at the top.
The Dutch are good also, but the Italians are good.
And I came across this little street in Venice, where the communist headquarters were sharing a wall with this Catholic shrine.
And I realized that, you know, Italy is a place where they can accept these different ideologies and deal with diversity and not have the problem, or they can choose to ignore them, but these -- you don't have warring factions, and I think that maybe the tolerance of the absurdity which has made Italy so innovative and so tolerant.
The past and the present work quite well together in Italy also, and I think that it's recognizable there, and has an important effect on culture, because their public spaces are protected, their sidewalks are protected, and you're actually able to confront these things physically, and I think this helps people get over their fear of modernism and other such things.
A change might be a typical street corner in San Francisco.
And I use this -- this is, sort of, what I consider to be urban spam.
I notice this stuff because I walk a lot, but here, private industry is really kind of making a mess of the public sector.
And as I look at it, I sort of say, you know, the publications that report on problems in the urban area also contribute to it, and it's just my call to say to all of us, public policy won't change this at all; private industry has to work to take things like this seriously.
The extreme might be in Italy where, again, there's kind of some type of control over what's happening in the environment is very evident, even in the way that they sell and distribute periodicals.
I walk to work every day or ride my scooter, and I come down and park in this little spot.
And I came down one day, and all the bikes were red.
Now, this is not going to impress you guys who Photoshop, and can do stuff, but this was an actual moment when I got off my bike, and I looked and I thought, it's as if all of my biker brethren had kind of gotten together and conspired to make a little statement.
And it reminded me that -- to keep in the present, to look out for these kinds of things.
It gave me possibilities for wonder -- if maybe it's a yellow day in San Francisco, and we could all agree, and create some installations.
But it also reminded me of the power of pattern and repetition to make an effect in our mind.
And I don't know if there's a stronger kind of effect than pattern and the way it unites kind of disparate elements.
I was at the art show in Miami in December, and spent a couple of hours looking at fine art, and amazed at the prices of art and how expensive it is, but having a great time looking at it.
And I came outside, and the valets for this car service had created, you know, quite a nice little collage of these car keys, and my closest equivalent were a group of prayer tags that I had seen in Tokyo.
And I thought that if pattern can unite these disparate elements, it can do just about anything.
I don't have very many shots of people, because they kind of get in the way of studying pure form.
I was in a small restaurant in Spain, having lunch -- one of those nice days where you had the place kind of to yourself, and you have a glass of wine, and enjoying the local area and the culture and the food and the quiet, and feeling very lucky, and a bus load of tourists arrived, emptied out, filled up the restaurant.
In a very short period of time, completely changed the atmosphere and character with loud voices and large bodies and such, and we had to get up and leave; it was just that uncomfortable.
And at that moment, the sun came out, and through this perforated screen, a pattern was cast over these bodies and they kind of faded into the rear, and we left the restaurant kind of feeling O.K. about stuff.
And I do think pattern has the capability of eradicating some of the most evil forces of society, such as bad form in restaurants, but quite seriously, it was a statement to me that one thing that you do, sort of, see is the aggressive nature of the industrial world has produced -- kind of, large masses of things, and when you -- in monoculture, and I think the preservation of diversity in culture is something that's important to us.
The last shots that I have deal with -- coming back to this theme of sidewalks, and I wanted to say something here about -- I'm, kind of, optimistic, you know.
Post-Second World War, the influence of the automobile has really been devastating in a lot of our cities.
A lot of urban areas have been converted into parking lots in a sort of indiscriminate use.
A lot of the planning departments became subordinated to the transportation department. It's as easy to rag on cars as it is on Wal-Mart; I'm not going to do that.
But they're real examples in urbanization and the change that's occurred in the last number of years, and the heightened sensitivity to the importance of our urban environments as cultural centers.
I think that they are, that the statements that we make in this public sector are our contributions to a larger whole.
Cities are the place where we're most likely to encounter diversity and to mix with other people.
We go there for stimulation in art and all those other things.
But I think people have recognized the sanctity of our urban areas.
A place like Chicago has really reached kind of a level of international stature.
The U.S. is actually becoming a bit of a leader in kind of enlightened urban planning and renewal, and I want to single out a place like Chicago, where I look at some guy like Mayor Daley as a bit of a design hero for being able to work through the political processes and all that to improve an area.
You would expect a city like this to have upgraded flower boxes on Michigan Avenue where wealthy people shop, but if you actually go along the street you find the flower boxes change from street to street: there's actual diversity in the plants.
And the idea that a city group can maintain different types of foliage is really quite exceptional.
There are common elements of this that you'll see throughout Chicago, and then there are your big-D design statements: the Pritzker Pavilion done by Frank Gehry.
My measure of this as being an important bit of design is not so much the way that it looks, but the fact that it performs a very important social function.
There are a lot of free concerts, for example, that go on in this area; it has a phenomenal acoustic system.
But the commitment that the city has made to the public area is significant, and almost an international model.
I work on the mayor's council in San Francisco, on the International Design Council for Mayors, and Chicago is looked at as the pinnacle, and I really would like to salute Mayor Daley and the folks there.
I thought that I should include at least one shot of technology for you guys.
This is also in Millennium Park in Chicago, where the Spanish artist-designer Plensa has created, kind of, a digital readout in this park that reflects back the characters and personalities of the people in this area.
And it's a welcoming area, I think, inclusive of diversity, reflective of diversity, and I think this marriage of both technology and art in the public sector is an area where the U.S.
can really take a leadership role, and Chicago is one example.
Thank you very much.
"The Road Not Taken" By Robert Frost Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood and looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.
Do you think the things we build today will be considered wonders in the future?
Think of Stonehenge, the Pyramids, Machu Picchu and Easter Island.
Now, they're all pretty different from what we're doing today, with those massive stones, assembled in complex but seemingly illogical ways, and all traces of their construction erased, shrouding them in mystery.
It seems like people could not have possibly built these things, because people didn't.
They were carefully crafted by a primordial race of giants known as Cyclops.
(Laughter) And I've been collaborating with these monsters to learn their secrets for moving those massive stones.
And as it turns out, Cyclops aren't even that strong.
They're just really smart about getting material to work for them.
Now, the videos you see behind me of large, stone-like, wobbly creatures are the results of this collaboration.
OK, so Cyclops might be a mythical creature, but those wonders are still real.
People made them.
But they also made the myths that surround them, and when it comes to wonders, there's this thick connective tissue between mythology and reality.
Take Easter Island, for example.
When the Dutch explorers first encountered the island, they asked the people of Rapa Nui how their ancestors could have possibly moved those massive statues.
And the Rapa Nui said, "Our ancestors didn't move the statues, because the statues walked themselves."
For centuries, this was dismissed, but actually it's true.
The statues, known as moai, were transported standing, pivoting from side to side.
OK?
As spectacular as the moai are for visitors today, you have to imagine being there then, with colossal moai marching around the island.
Because the real memorial was not the objects themselves, it was the cultural ritual of bringing a stone to life.
So as an architect, I've been chasing that dream.
How can we shift our idea of construction to accommodate that mythical side?
So what I've been doing is challenging myself with putting on a series of performances of the ancient but pretty straightforward task of just moving and standing big heavy objects, like this 16-foot-tall megalith designed to walk across land and stand vertically; or this 4,000-pound behemoth that springs itself to life to dance onstage.
And what I've found is that by thinking of architecture not as an end product but as a performance from conception to completion, we end up rediscovering some really smart ways to build things today.
You know, so much of the discussion surrounding our future focuses on technology, efficiency and speed.
But if I've learned anything from Cyclops, it's that wonders can be smart, spectacular and sustainable -- because of their mass and their mystery.
And while people still want to know how those ancient wonders were built, I've been asking Cyclops how to create the mystery that compels people to ask that very question.
Because in an era where we design buildings to last 30, maybe 60 years, I would love to learn how to create something that could entertain for an eternity.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Alright, let's get this kicked off.
(Music) (Singing) It's OK to be gay.
We are different in many ways.
Doesn't matter if you're a boy, girl or somewhere in between, we all are part of one big family.
Gay means "happy."
Queer Kid Stuff.
You are enough here at Queer Kid Stuff.
(Applause) Opening a performance with lyrics like "It's OK to be gay" for a roomful of adults is one thing, but it's entirely different for a roomful of kindergartners.
What you've just heard is the theme song for my web series "Queer Kid Stuff," where I make LGBTQ+ and social justice videos for all ages.
And when I say all ages, I mean literal babies to your great-great-grandma.
Now, I know what you're thinking: "Whoa, they're talking about gay stuff with kids."
But talking to kids about gay stuff is actually crucial.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has found that children have a solid understanding of their gender identity by the age of four.
This is when children are developing their sense of self.
They're observing the world around them, absorbing that information and internalizing it.
Now, most parents want their children to become kind, empathetic, self-confident adults, and exposure to diversity is an important part of that social and emotional development.
And -- gender nonconforming kids and trans kids and kids with trans and nonbinary and queer parents are everywhere.
In the series, my stuffed bear cohost and I talk about the LGBT community, activism, gender and pronouns, consent and body positivity.
We tackle these topics through songs, not unlike the one you just heard, simple definitions and metaphors.
We approach these ideas, to steal a phrase from an old professor of mine, from "under the doorknob" -- getting down to toddler height and looking up at the great big world through their tiny little eyes, taking these seemingly complex ideas and simplifying them -- not dumbing them down, but homing in on the core concept.
Gender is about how we feel and how we express ourselves.
Sexuality is about love and gender and family, not about sex.
And these are all ideas children can grasp.
In one of my earliest episodes about gender, I used the idea of pronouns to underscore the definition and introduce gender-neutral pronouns like "they" and "them."
I encourage children to think about their own pronouns and to ask others for theirs.
In later episodes, I build on this foundation and introduce big fancy words like "nonbinary" and "transgender."
I get emails from viewers in their 20s who use my videos to explain nonbinary gender to their grandparents.
But, I get one comment over and over again: "Let kids be kids."
Well, that's a nice sentiment and all, but only if it actually includes all kids.
Just a few weeks ago, a 15-year-old in Huntsville, Alabama died by suicide after being bullied for being gay.
In 2018, it was a seven-year-old in Denver, Colorado.
There have been and will be many more.
Lesbian, gay and bisexual teens are more than three times more likely to attempt suicide than their heterosexual peers, and transgender teens are almost six times more likely.
According to one study, roughly one third of homeless youth identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or questioning, and about four percent of homeless youth identify as transgender, compared with one percent of the general youth population surveyed.
According to the Human Rights Campaign, there have been 128 killings of trans people in 87 cities across 32 states since 2013.
And those are the only the reported cases.
And 80 percent of those killings were of trans women of color.
The queer situation is bleak, to say the least.
The YouTube comments on my videos are not much better.
I'm used to the harassment.
I get messages daily telling me I'm a pedophile and that I should kill myself in a number of increasingly creative ways.
I once had to put the word "truck" on my block list because someone wanted me to get run over by a truck.
"Shower" and "oven" are in there, too, for the less creative and more disturbing Holocaust reference.
When neo-Nazis marched in Charlottesville, I was unsurprised to learn that the creator of a violent Reddit meme about one of my episodes was in the tiki torch crowd.
This barrage of negativity is what we're up against: the crushing statistics, the violence, the mental health risks, the well-meaning but flawed response my parents gave me when I came out, that they didn't want me to have a harder life.
That's what we're up against.
But in the face of all that, I choose joy.
I choose rainbows and unicorns and glitter, and I sing that it's OK to be gay with my childhood stuffed teddy bear.
I make queer media for kids because I wish I had this when I was their age.
I make it so others don't have to struggle through what I did, not understanding my identity because I didn't have any exposure to who I could be.
I teach and spread this message through joy and positivity instead of framing it around the hardships of queer life.
I want kids to grow up and into themselves with pride for who they are and who they can be, no matter who they love or what they wear or what pronouns they use.
And I want them to love others for their differences, not in spite of them.
I think fostering this pride and empathy will make the world a kinder and more equal place and combat the bigotry and hate that festers in our world.
So, talk to a kid about gender.
Talk to a kid about sexuality.
Teach them about consent.
Tell them it is OK for boys to wear dresses and for girls to speak up.
Let's spread radical queer joy.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Deep beneath the geysers and hot springs of Yellowstone Caldera lies a magma chamber produced by a hot spot in the earth’s mantle.
As the magma moves towards the Earth’s surface, it crystallizes to form young, hot igneous rocks.
The heat from these rocks drives groundwater towards the surface.
As the water cools, ions precipitate out as mineral crystals, including quartz crystals from silicon and oxygen, feldspar from potassium, aluminum, silicon, and oxygen, galena from lead and sulfur.
Many of these crystals have signature shapes— take this cascade of pointed quartz, or this pile of galena cubes.
But what causes them to grow into these shapes again and again?
Part of the answer lies in their atoms.
Every crystal’s atoms are arranged in a highly organized, repeating pattern.
This pattern is the defining feature of a crystal, and isn’t restricted to minerals— sand, ice, sugar, chocolate, ceramics, metals, DNA, and even some liquids have crystalline structures.
Each crystalline material’s atomic arrangement falls into one of six different families: cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic, monoclinic, triclinic, and hexagonal.
Given the appropriate conditions, crystals will grow into geometric shapes that reflect the arrangement of their atoms.
Take galena, which has a cubic structure composed of lead and sulfur atoms.
The relatively large lead atoms are arranged in a three-dimensional grid 90 degrees from one another, while the relatively small sulfur atoms fit neatly between them.
As the crystal grows, locations like these attract sulfur atoms, while lead will tend to bond to these places.
Eventually, they will complete the grid of bonded atoms.
This means the 90 degree grid pattern of galena’s crystalline structure is reflected in the visible shape of the crystal.
Quartz, meanwhile, has a hexagonal crystalline structure.
This means that on one plane its atoms are arranged in hexagons.
In three dimensions, these hexagons are composed of many interlocking pyramids made up of one silicon atom and four oxygen atoms.
So the signature shape of a quartz crystal is a six-sided column with pointed tips.
Depending on environmental conditions, most crystals have the potential to form multiple geometric shapes.
For example, diamonds, which form deep in the Earth’s mantle, have a cubic crystalline structure and can grow into either cubes or octahedrons.
Which shape a particular diamond grows into depends on the conditions where it grows, including pressure, temperature, and chemical environment.
While we can’t directly observe growth conditions in the mantle, laboratory experiments have shown some evidence that diamonds tend to grow into cubes at lower temperatures and octahedrons at higher temperatures.
Trace amounts of water, silicon, germanium, or magnesium might also influence a diamond’s shape.
And diamonds never naturally grow into the shapes found in jewelry— those diamonds have been cut to showcase sparkle and clarity.
Environmental conditions can also influence whether crystals form at all.
Glass is made of melted quartz sand, but it isn’t crystalline.
That’s because glass cools relatively quickly, and the atoms do not have time to arrange themselves into the ordered structure of a quartz crystal.
Instead, the random arrangement of the atoms in the melted glass is locked in upon cooling.
Many crystals don’t form geometric shapes because they grow in extremely close quarters with other crystals.
Rocks like granite are full of crystals, but none have recognizable shapes.
As magma cools and solidifies, many minerals within it crystallize at the same time and quickly run out of space.
And certain crystals, like turquoise, don’t grow into any discernible geometric shape in most environmental conditions, even given adequate space.
Every crystal’s atomic structure has unique properties, and while these properties may not have any bearing on human emotional needs, they do have powerful applications in materials science and medicine.
I want to talk today about how reading can change our lives and about the limits of that change.
I want to talk to you about how reading can give us a shareable world of powerful human connection.
But also about how that connection is always partial.
How reading is ultimately a lonely, idiosyncratic undertaking.
The writer who changed my life was the great African American novelist James Baldwin.
When I was growing up in Western Michigan in the 1980s, there weren't many Asian American writers interested in social change.
And so I think I turned to James Baldwin as a way to fill this void, as a way to feel racially conscious.
But perhaps because I knew I wasn't myself African American, I also felt challenged and indicted by his words.
Especially these words: "There are liberals who have all the proper attitudes, but no real convictions.
When the chips are down and you somehow expect them to deliver, they are somehow not there."
They are somehow not there.
I took those words very literally.
Where should I put myself?
I went to the Mississippi Delta, one of the poorest regions in the United States.
This is a place shaped by a powerful history.
In the 1960s, African Americans risked their lives to fight for education, to fight for the right to vote.
I wanted to be a part of that change, to help young teenagers graduate and go to college.
When I got to the Mississippi Delta, it was a place that was still poor, still segregated, still dramatically in need of change.
My school, where I was placed, had no library, no guidance counselor, but it did have a police officer.
Half the teachers were substitutes and when students got into fights, the school would send them to the local county jail.
This is the school where I met Patrick.
He was 15 and held back twice, he was in the eighth grade.
He was quiet, introspective, like he was always in deep thought.
And he hated seeing other people fight.
I saw him once jump between two girls when they got into a fight and he got himself knocked to the ground.
Patrick had just one problem.
He wouldn't come to school.
He said that sometimes school was just too depressing because people were always fighting and teachers were quitting.
And also, his mother worked two jobs and was just too tired to make him come.
So I made it my job to get him to come to school.
And because I was crazy and 22 and zealously optimistic, my strategy was just to show up at his house and say, "Hey, why don't you come to school?"
And this strategy actually worked, he started to come to school every day.
And he started to flourish in my class.
He was writing poetry, he was reading books.
He was coming to school every day.
Around the same time that I had figured out how to connect to Patrick, I got into law school at Harvard.
I once again faced this question, where should I put myself, where do I put my body?
And I thought to myself that the Mississippi Delta was a place where people with money, people with opportunity, those people leave.
And the people who stay behind are the people who don't have the chance to leave.
I didn't want to be a person who left.
I wanted to be a person who stayed.
On the other hand, I was lonely and tired.
And so I convinced myself that I could do more change on a larger scale if I had a prestigious law degree.
So I left.
Three years later, when I was about to graduate from law school, my friend called me and told me that Patrick had got into a fight and killed someone.
I was devastated.
Part of me didn't believe it, but part of me also knew that it was true.
I flew down to see Patrick.
I visited him in jail.
And he told me that it was true.
That he had killed someone.
And he didn't want to talk more about it.
I asked him what had happened with school and he said that he had dropped out the year after I left.
And then he wanted to tell me something else.
He looked down and he said that he had had a baby daughter who was just born.
And he felt like he had let her down.
That was it, our conversation was rushed and awkward.
When I stepped outside the jail, a voice inside me said, "Come back.
If you don't come back now, you'll never come back."
So I graduated from law school and I went back.
I went back to see Patrick, I went back to see if I could help him with his legal case.
And this time, when I saw him a second time, I thought I had this great idea, I said, "Hey, Patrick, why don't you write a letter to your daughter, so that you can keep her on your mind?"
And I handed him a pen and a piece of paper, and he started to write.
But when I saw the paper that he handed back to me, I was shocked.
I didn't recognize his handwriting, he had made simple spelling mistakes.
And I thought to myself that as a teacher, I knew that a student could dramatically improve in a very quick amount of time, but I never thought that a student could dramatically regress.
What even pained me more, was seeing what he had written to his daughter.
He had written, "I'm sorry for my mistakes, I'm sorry for not being there for you."
And this was all he felt he had to say to her.
And I asked myself how can I convince him that he has more to say, parts of himself that he doesn't need to apologize for.
I wanted him to feel that he had something worthwhile to share with his daughter.
For every day the next seven months, I visited him and brought books.
My tote bag became a little library.
I brought James Baldwin, I brought Walt Whitman, C.S. Lewis.
I brought guidebooks to trees, to birds, and what would become his favorite book, the dictionary.
On some days, we would sit for hours in silence, both of us reading.
And on other days, we would read together, we would read poetry.
We started by reading haikus, hundreds of haikus, a deceptively simple masterpiece.
And I would ask him, "Share with me your favorite haikus."
And some of them are quite funny.
So there's this by Issa: "Don't worry, spiders, I keep house casually."
And this: "Napped half the day, no one punished me!"
And this gorgeous one, which is about the first day of snow falling, "Deer licking first frost from each other's coats."
There's something mysterious and gorgeous just about the way a poem looks.
The empty space is as important as the words themselves.
We read this poem by W.S. Merwin, which he wrote after he saw his wife working in the garden and realized that they would spend the rest of their lives together.
"Let me imagine that we will come again when we want to and it will be spring We will be no older than we ever were The worn griefs will have eased like the early cloud through which morning slowly comes to itself" I asked Patrick what his favorite line was, and he said, "We will be no older than we ever were."
He said it reminded him of a place where time just stops, where time doesn't matter anymore.
And I asked him if he had a place like that, where time lasts forever.
And he said, "My mother."
When you read a poem alongside someone else, the poem changes in meaning.
Because it becomes personal to that person, becomes personal to you.
We then read books, we read so many books, we read the memoir of Frederick Douglass, an American slave who taught himself to read and write and who escaped to freedom because of his literacy.
I had grown up thinking of Frederick Douglass as a hero and I thought of this story as one of uplift and hope.
But this book put Patrick in a kind of panic.
He fixated on a story Douglass told of how, over Christmas, masters give slaves gin as a way to prove to them that they can't handle freedom.
Because slaves would be stumbling on the fields.
Patrick said he related to this.
He said that there are people in jail who, like slaves, don't want to think about their condition, because it's too painful.
Too painful to think about the past, too painful to think about how far we have to go.
His favorite line was this line: "Anything, no matter what, to get rid of thinking!
It was this everlasting thinking of my condition that tormented me."
Patrick said that Douglass was brave to write, to keep thinking.
But Patrick would never know how much he seemed like Douglass to me.
How he kept reading, even though it put him in a panic.
He finished the book before I did, reading it in a concrete stairway with no light.
And then we went on to read one of my favorite books, Marilynne Robinson's "Gilead," which is an extended letter from a father to his son.
He loved this line: "I'm writing this in part to tell you that if you ever wonder what you've done in your life ...
you have been God's grace to me, a miracle, something more than a miracle."
Something about this language, its love, its longing, its voice, rekindled Patrick's desire to write.
And he would fill notebooks upon notebooks with letters to his daughter.
In these beautiful, intricate letters, he would imagine him and his daughter going canoeing down the Mississippi river.
He would imagine them finding a mountain stream with perfectly clear water.
As I watched Patrick write, I thought to myself, and I now ask all of you, how many of you have written a letter to somebody you feel you have let down?
It is just much easier to put those people out of your mind.
But Patrick showed up every day, facing his daughter, holding himself accountable to her, word by word with intense concentration.
I wanted in my own life to put myself at risk in that way.
Because that risk reveals the strength of one's heart.
Let me take a step back and just ask an uncomfortable question.
Who am I to tell this story, as in this Patrick story?
Patrick's the one who lived with this pain and I have never been hungry a day in my life.
I thought about this question a lot, but what I want to say is that this story is not just about Patrick.
It's about us, it's about the inequality between us.
The world of plenty that Patrick and his parents and his grandparents have been shut out of.
In this story, I represent that world of plenty.
And in telling this story, I didn't want to hide myself.
Hide the power that I do have.
In telling this story, I wanted to expose that power and then to ask, how do we diminish the distance between us?
Reading is one way to close that distance.
It gives us a quiet universe that we can share together, that we can share in equally.
You're probably wondering now what happened to Patrick.
Did reading save his life?
It did and it didn't.
When Patrick got out of prison, his journey was excruciating.
Employers turned him away because of his record, his best friend, his mother, died at age 43 from heart disease and diabetes.
He's been homeless, he's been hungry.
So people say a lot of things about reading that feel exaggerated to me.
Being literate didn't stop him form being discriminated against.
It didn't stop his mother from dying.
So what can reading do?
I have a few answers to end with today.
Reading charged his inner life with mystery, with imagination, with beauty.
Reading gave him images that gave him joy: mountain, ocean, deer, frost.
Words that taste of a free, natural world.
Reading gave him a language for what he had lost.
How precious are these lines from the poet Derek Walcott?
Patrick memorized this poem.
"Days that I have held, days that I have lost, days that outgrow, like daughters, my harboring arms."
Reading taught him his own courage.
Remember that he kept reading Frederick Douglass, even though it was painful.
He kept being conscious, even though being conscious hurts.
Reading is a form of thinking, that's why it's difficult to read because we have to think.
And Patrick chose to think, rather than to not think.
And last, reading gave him a language to speak to his daughter.
Reading inspired him to want to write.
The link between reading and writing is so powerful.
When we begin to read, we begin to find the words.
And he found the words to imagine the two of them together.
He found the words to tell her how much he loved her.
Reading also changed our relationship with each other.
It gave us an occasion for intimacy, to see beyond our points of view.
And reading took an unequal relationship and gave us a momentary equality.
When you meet somebody as a reader, you meet him for the first time, newly, freshly.
There is no way you can know what his favorite line will be.
What memories and private griefs he has.
And you face the ultimate privacy of his inner life.
And then you start to wonder, "Well, what is my inner life made of?
What do I have that's worthwhile to share with another?"
I want to close on some of my favorite lines from Patrick's letters to his daughter.
"The river is shadowy in some places but the light shines through the cracks of trees ...
On some branches hang plenty of mulberries.
You stretch your arm straight out to grab some."
And this lovely letter, where he writes, "Close your eyes and listen to the sounds of the words.
I know this poem by heart and I would like you to know it, too."
Thank you so much everyone.
(Applause)
This is a wheat bread, a whole wheat bread, and it's made with a new technique that I've been playing around with, and developing and writing about which, for lack of a better name, we call the epoxy method.
And I call it an epoxy method because -- it's not very appetizing. I understand that -- but -- but if you think about epoxy, what's epoxy?
It's two resins that are, sort of, in and of themselves -- neither of which can make glue, but when you put the two together, something happens. A bond takes place, and you get this very strong, powerful adhesive.
Well, in this technique, what I've tried to do is kind of gather all of the knowledge that the bread-baking world, the artisan bread-baking community, has been trying to accumulate over the last 20 years or so -- since we've been engaged in a bread renaissance in America -- and put it together to come up with a method that would help to take whole-grain breads.
And let's face it, everyone's trying to move towards whole grains.
We finally, after 40 years of knowing that wholegrain was a healthier option, we're finally getting to the point where we actually are tipping over and attempting to actually eat them.
(Laughter) The challenge, though, for a wholegrain baker is, you know, how do you make it taste good?
Because whole grain -- it's easy with white flour to make a good-tasting bread. White flour is sweet.
It's mainly starch, and starch, when you break it down -- what is starch? It's -- thank you -- sugar, yes.
So a baker, and a good baker, knows how to pull or draw forth the inherent sugar trapped in the starch.
With whole grain bread, you have other obstacles.
You've got bran, which is probably the healthiest part of the bread for us, or the fiber for us because it is just loaded with fiber, for the bran is fiber.
It's got germ. Those are the good things, but those aren't the tastiest parts of the wheat.
So whole grain breads historically have had sort of this onus of being health food breads, and people don't like to eat, quote, health food. They like to eat healthy and healthily, but when we think of something as a health food, we think of it as something we eat out of obligation, not out of passion and love for the flavor.
And ultimately, the challenge of the baker, the challenge of every culinary student, of every chef, is to deliver flavor.
Flavor is king. Flavor rules.
I call it the flavor rule. Flavor rules.
And -- and you can get somebody to eat something that's good for them once, but they won't eat it again if they don't like it, right?
So, this is the challenge for this bread.
We're going to try this at lunch, and I'll explain a bit more about it, but it's made not only with two types of pre-doughs -- this attempt, again, at bringing out flavor is to make a piece of dough the day before that is not leavened.
It's just dough that is wet.
It's hydrated dough we call "the soaker" -- that helps to start enzyme activity.
And enzymes are the secret, kind of, ingredient in dough that brings out flavor.
It starts to release the sugars trapped in the starch.
That's what enzymes are doing.
And so, if we can release some of those, they become accessible to us in our palate.
They become accessible to the yeast as food.
They become accessible to the oven for caramelization to give us a beautiful crust.
The other pre-dough that we make is fermented -- our pre-ferment.
And it's made -- it can be a sourdough starter, or what we call a "biga" or any other kind of pre-fermented dough with a little yeast in it, and that starts to develop flavor also.
And on day two, we put those two pieces together. That's the epoxy.
And we're hoping that, sort of, the enzyme piece of dough becomes the fuel pack for the leavened piece of dough, and when we put them together and add the final ingredients, we can create a bread that does evoke the full potential of flavor trapped in the grain.
That's the challenge. Okay, so, now, what we -- in the journey of wheat, let's go back and look at these 12 stages.
I'm going to go through them very quickly and then revisit them.
Okay, we're going to start with the first stage.
And this is what every student has to begin with.
Everyone who works in the culinary world knows that the first stage of cooking is "mise en place," which is just a French way of saying, "get organized."
Everything in its place. First stage.
So in baking we call it scaling -- weighing out the ingredients.
Stage two is mixing. We take the ingredients and we mix them.
We have to develop the gluten.
There's no gluten in flour. There's only the potential for gluten.
Here's another kind of prefiguring of epoxy because we've got glutenin and gliadin, neither of which are strong enough to make a good bread.
But when they get hydrated and they bond to each other, they create a stronger molecule, a stronger protein we call gluten.
And so we, in the mixing process, have to develop the gluten, we have to activate the leaven or the yeast, and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly.
Then we get into fermentation, the third stage, which is really where the flavor develops.
The yeast comes alive and starts eating the sugars, creating carbon dioxide and alcohol -- essentially it's burping and sweating, which is what bread is.
It's yeast burps and sweat.
And somehow, this is transformed -- the yeast burps and sweats are later transformed -- and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special is that it is a transformational food, and we're going to explore that in a minute.
But then, quickly through the next few stages.
We, after it's fermented and it's developed, started to develop flavor and character, we divide it into smaller units.
And then we take those units and we shape them. We give them a little pre-shape, usually a round or a little torpedo shape, sometimes.
That's called "rounding."
And there's a short rest period. It can be for a few seconds.
It can be for 20 or 30 minutes. We call that resting or benching.
Then we go into final shaping, "panning" -- which means putting the shaped loaf on a pan.
This takes a second, but it's a distinctive stage.
It can be in a basket. It can be in a loaf pan, but we pan it.
And then, stage nine.
The fermentation which started at stage three is continuing through all these other stages. Again, developing more flavor.
The final fermentation takes place in stage nine.
We call it "proofing."
Proofing means to prove that the dough is alive.
And at stage nine we get the dough to the final shape, and it goes into the oven -- stage 10.
Three transformations take place in the oven.
The sugars in the dough caramelize in the crust.
They give us that beautiful brown crust.
Only the crust can caramelize. It's the only place that gets hot enough.
Inside, the proteins -- this gluten -- coagulates.
When it gets to about 160 degrees, the proteins all line up and they create structure, the gluten structure -- what ultimately we will call the crumb of the bread.
And the starches, when they reach about 180 degrees, gelatinize.
And gelatinization is yet another oven transformation.
Coagulation, caramelization and gelatinization -- when the starch is thick and they absorb all the moisture that's around them, they -- they kind of swell, and then they burst.
And they burst, and they spill their guts into the bread.
So basically now we're eating yeast sweats -- sweat, burps and starch guts.
Again, transformed in stage 10 in the oven because what went into the oven as dough comes out in stage 11 as bread.
And stage 11, we call it cooling -- because we never really eat the bread right away.
There's a little carry-over baking.
The proteins have to set up, strengthen and firm up.
And then we have stage 12, which the textbooks call "packaging," but my students call "eating."
And so, we're going to be on our own journey today from wheat to eat, and in a few minutes we will try this, and see if we have succeeded in fulfilling this baker's mission of pulling out flavor.
But I want to go back now and revisit these steps, and talk about it from the standpoint of transformation, because I really believe that all things can be understood -- and this is not my own idea. This goes back to the Scholastics and to the Ancients -- that all things can be understood on four levels: the literal, the metaphoric or poetic level, the political or ethical level.
And ultimately, the mystical or sometimes called the "anagogical" level.
It's hard to get to those levels unless you go through the literal.
In fact, Dante says you can't understand the three deeper levels unless you first understand the literal level, so that's why we're talking literally about bread.
But let's kind of look at these stages again from the standpoint of connections to possibly a deeper level -- all in my quest for answering the question, "What is it about bread that's so special?"
And fulfilling this mission of evoking the full potential of flavor.
Because what happens is, bread begins as wheat or any other grain.
But what's wheat? Wheat is a grass that grows in the field.
And, like all grasses, at a certain point it puts out seeds.
And we harvest those seeds, and those are the wheat kernels.
Now, in order to harvest it -- I mean, what's harvesting?
It's just a euphemism for killing, right?
I mean, that's what's harvest -- we say we harvest the pig, you know?
Yes, we slaughter, you know. Yes, that's life.
We harvest the wheat, and in harvesting it, we kill it.
Now, wheat is alive, and as we harvest it, it gives up its seeds.
Now, at least with seeds we have the potential for future life.
We can plant those in the ground.
And we save some of those for the next generation.
But most of those seeds get crushed and turned into flour.
And at that point, the wheat has suffered the ultimate indignity.
It's not only been killed, but it's been denied any potential for creating future life.
So we turn it into flour.
So as I said, I think bread is a transformational food.
The first transformation -- and, by the way, the definition of transformation for me is a radical change from one thing into something else.
O.K.? Radical, not subtle.
Not like hot water made cold, or cold water turned hot, but water boiled off and becoming steam.
That's a transformation, two different things.
Well, in this case, the first transformation is alive to dead.
I'd call that radical.
So, we've got now this flour.
And what do we do? We add some water.
In stage one, we weigh it.
In stage two, we add water and salt to it, mix it together, and we create something that we call "clay."
It's like clay.
And we infuse that clay with an ingredient that we call "leaven."
In this case, it's yeast, but yeast is leaven. What does leaven mean?
Leaven comes from the root word that means enliven -- to vivify, to bring to life.
By the way, what's the Hebrew word for clay? Adam.
You see, the baker, in this moment, has become, in a sense, sort of, the God of his dough, you know, and his dough, well, while it's not an intelligent life form, is now alive.
And we know it's alive because in stage three, it grows. Growth is the proof of life.
And while it's growing, all these literal transformations are taking place.
Enzymes are breaking forth sugars.
Yeast is eating sugar and turning it into carbon dioxide and alcohol.
Bacteria is in there, eating the same sugars, turning them into acids.
In other words, personality and character's being developed in this dough under the watchful gaze of the baker.
And the baker's choices all along the way determine the outcome of the product.
A subtle change in temperature -- a subtle change in time -- it's all about a balancing act between time, temperature and ingredients. That's the art of baking.
So all these things are determined by the baker, and the bread goes through some stages, and characters develop.
And then we divide it, and this one big piece of dough is divided into smaller units, and each of those units are given shape by the baker.
And as they're shaped, they're raised again, all along proving that they're alive, and developing character.
And at stage 10, we take it to the oven.
It's still dough. Nobody eats bread dough -- a few people do, I think, but not too many.
I've met some dough eaters, but -- it's not the staff of life, right? Bread is the staff of life.
But dough is what we're working with, and we take that dough to the oven, and it goes into the oven. As soon as the interior temperature of that dough crosses the threshold of 140 degrees, it passes what we call the "thermal death point."
Students love that TDP. They think it's the name of a video game.
But it's the thermal death point -- all life ceases there.
The yeast, whose mission it has been up till now to raise the dough, to enliven it, to vivify it, in order to complete its mission, which is also to turn this dough into bread, has to give up its life.
So you see the symbolism at work? It's starting to come forth a little bit, you know.
It's starting to make sense to me -- what goes in is dough, what comes out is bread -- or it goes in alive, comes out dead.
Third transformation. First transformation, alive to dead.
Second transformation, dead brought back to life.
Third transformation, alive to dead -- but dough to bread.
Or another analogy would be, a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly.
And it's what comes out of the oven that is what we call the staff of life.
This is the product that everyone in the world eats, that is so difficult to give up.
It's so deeply embedded in our psyches that bread is used as a symbol for life.
It's used as a symbol for transformation.
And so, as we get to stage 12 and we partake of that, again completing the life cycle, you know, we have a chance to essentially ingest that -- it nurtures us, and we continue to carry on and have opportunities to ponder things like this.
So this is what I've learned from bread.
This is what bread has taught me in my journey.
And what we're going to attempt to do with this bread here, again, is to use, in addition to everything we talked about, this bread we're going to call "spent grain bread" because, as you know, bread-making is very similar to beer-making.
Beer is basically liquid bread, or bread is solid beer.
And -- (Laughter) they -- they're invented around the same time. I think beer came first.
And the Egyptian who was tending the beer fell asleep in the hot, Egyptian sun, and it turned into bread.
But we've got this bread, and what I did here is to try to, again, evoke even more flavor from this grain, was we've added into it the spent grain from beer-making.
And if you make this bread, you can use any kind of spent grain from any type of beer.
I like dark spent grain. Today we're using a light spent grain that's actually from, like, some kind of a lager of some sort -- a light lager or an ale -- that is wheat and barley that's been toasted.
In other words, the beer-maker knows also how to evoke flavor from the grains by using sprouting and malting and roasting.
We're going to take some of that, and put it into the bread.
So now we not only have a high-fiber bread, but now fiber on top of fiber.
And so this is, again, hopefully not only a healthy bread, but a bread that you will enjoy.
So, if I, kind of, break this bread, maybe we can share this now a little bit here.
We'll start a little piece here, and I'm going to take a little piece here -- I think I'd better taste it myself before you have it at lunch.
I'll leave you with what I call the baker's blessing.
May your crust be crisp, and your bread always rise.
Thank you.
I have a friend named Kaveh Akbar, who is a fellow poet.
And Kaveh found this photo online of the anatomical heart of a blue whale that scientists had hung on a hook from the ceiling, which is how they were able to observe that the heart of a blue whale is big enough that a person can stand up fully inside of it.
And when Kaveh shared this photo online, he did so with the caption, "This is another reminder that the universe has already written the poem you were planning on writing."
And when I first saw that, I was horrified.
I was like, "Come on, man! I'm trying to invent new metaphors!
I'm trying to discover beauty that hasn't been discovered yet.
What do you mean, the universe is always going to get there before me?"
And I know this isn't a uniquely poet problem, but on days when the world feels especially big or especially impossible or especially full of grandeur, those are the days when I feel, "What do I possibly have to contribute to all of this?"
Not long ago, I saw this video that some of you may have seen.
It makes the internet rounds every couple of months.
There are these birds that are called starlings, and they fly in what's called a "murmuration," which is generally just a big cloud of birds.
And someone happened to catch a quick video on their phone of these starlings flying.
And at first, it's just an amorphous blob, and then there's a moment where the birds shift, and they form the shape of a starling in the sky!
(Laughter) And as soon as I saw it, I was like, (Gasps) "The universe has already written the poem you were planning on writing!"
(Laughter) Except, for the first time, it didn't fill me with despair.
Instead, I thought, "OK.
Maybe instead it's my job to listen to what the universe is showing me and to keep myself open to what the universe offers, so that when it's my turn, I can hold something to the light, just for a moment, just for as long as I have.
The universe has already written the poem that you were planning on writing.
And this is why you can do nothing but point at the flock of starlings whose bodies rise and fall in inherited choreography, swarming the sky in a sweeping curtain that, for one blistering moment, forms the unmistakeable shape of a giant bird flapping against the sky.
It is why your mouth forms an "o" that is not a gasp, but rather, the beginning of, "Oh. Of course."
As in, of course the heart of a blue whale is as large as a house with chambers tall enough to fit a person standing.
Of course a fig becomes possible when a lady wasp lays her eggs inside a flower, dies and decomposes, the fruit, evidence of her transformation.
Sometimes, the poem is so bright, your silly language will not stick to it.
Sometimes, the poem is so true, nobody will believe you.
I am a bird made of birds.
This blue heart a house you can stand up inside of.
I am dying here inside this flower.
It is OK.
It is what I was put here to do.
Take this fruit.
It is what I have to offer.
It may not be first, or ever best, but it is the only way to be sure that I lived at all.
(Applause)
I'm going to talk about a very fundamental change that is going on in the very fabric of the modern economy.
And to talk about that, I'm going to go back to the beginning, because in the beginning were commodities.
Commodities are things that you grow in the ground, raise on the ground or pull out of the ground: basically, animal, mineral, vegetable.
And then you extract them out of the ground, and sell them on the open marketplace.
Commodities were the basis of the agrarian economy that lasted for millennia.
But then along came the industrial revolution, and then goods became the predominant economic offering, where we used commodities as a raw material to be able to make or manufacture goods.
So, we moved from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy.
Well, what then happened over the last 50 or 60 years, is that goods have become commoditized.
Commoditized: where they're treated like a commodity, where people don't care who makes them.
They just care about three things and three things only: price, price and price.
Now, there's an antidote to commoditization, and that is customization.
My first book was called "Mass Customization" -- it came up a couple of times yesterday -- and how I discovered this progression of economic value was realizing that customizing a good automatically turned it into a service, because it was done just for a particular person, because it wasn't inventoried, it was delivered on demand to that individual person.
So, we moved from an industrial economy to a service-based economy.
But over the past 10 or 20 years, what's happened is that services are being commoditized as well.
Long-distance telephone service sold on price, price, price; fast-food restaurants with all their value pricing; and even the Internet is commoditizing not just goods, but services as well.
What that means is that it's time to move to a new level of economic value.
Time to go beyond the goods and the services, and use, in that same heuristic, what happens when you customize a service?
What happens when you design a service that is so appropriate for a particular person -- that's exactly what they need at this moment in time?
Then you can't help but make them go "wow"; you can't help but turn it into a memorable event -- you can't help but turn it into an experience.
So we're shifting to an experience economy, where experiences are becoming the predominant economic offering.
Now most places that I talk to, when I talk about experience, I talk about Disney -- the world's premier experience-stager.
I talk about theme restaurants, and experiential retail, and boutique hotels, and Las Vegas -- the experience capital of the world.
But here, when you think about experiences, think about Thomas Dolby and his group, playing music.
Think about meaningful places.
Think about drinking wine, about a journey to the Clock of the Long Now.
Those are all experiences. Think about TED itself.
The experience capital in the world of conferences.
All of these are experiences.
Now, over the last several years I spent a lot of time in Europe, and particularly in the Netherlands, and whenever I talk about the experience economy there, I'm always greeted at the end with one particular question, almost invariably.
And the question isn't really so much a question as an accusation.
And the Dutch, when they usually put it, it always starts with the same two words.
You know the words I mean?
You Americans.
They say, you Americans.
You like your fantasy environments, your fake, your Disneyland experiences.
They say, we Dutch, we like real, natural, authentic experiences.
So much has that happened that I've developed a fairly praticed response, which is: I point out that first of all, you have to understand that there is no such thing as an inauthentic experience.
Why? Because the experience happens inside of us.
It's our reaction to the events that are staged in front of us.
So, as long as we are in any sense authentic human beings, then every experience we have is authentic.
Now, there may be more or less natural or artificial stimuli for the experience, but even that is a matter of degree, not kind.
And there's no such thing as a 100 percent natural experience.
Even if you go for a walk in the proverbial woods, there is a company that manufactured the car that delivered you to the edge of the woods; there's a company that manufactured the shoes that you have to protect yourself from the ground of the woods.
There's a company that provides a cell phone service you have in case you get lost in the woods.
Right? All of those are man-made, artificiality brought into the woods by you, and by the very nature of being there.
And then I always finish off by talking about -- the thing that amazes me the most about this question, particularly coming from the Dutch, is that the Netherlands is every bit as manufactured as Disneyland.
(Laughter) And the Dutch, they always go ...
and they realize, I'm right!
There isn't a square meter of ground in the entire country that hasn't been reclaimed from the sea, or otherwise moved, modified and manicured to look as if it had always been there.
It's the only place you ever go for a walk in the woods and all the trees are lined up in rows.
(Laughter) But nonetheless, not just the Dutch, but everyone has this desire for the authentic.
And authenticity is therefore becoming the new consumer sensibility -- the buying criteria by which consumers are choosing who are they going to buy from, and what they're going to buy.
Becoming the basis of the economy.
In fact, you can look at how each of these economies developed, that each one has their own business imperative, matched with a consumer sensibility.
We're the agrarian economy, and we're supplying commodities.
It's about supply and availability.
Getting the commodities to market.
With the industrial economy, it is about controlling costs -- getting the costs down as low as possible so we can offer them to the masses.
With the service economy, it is about improving quality.
That has -- the whole quality movement has risen with the service economy over the past 20 or 30 years.
And now, with the experience economy, it's about rendering authenticity.
Rendering authenticity -- and the keyword is "rendering."
Right? Rendering, because you have to get your consumers -- as business people -- to percieve your offerings as authentic.
Because there is a basic paradox: no one can have an inauthentic experience, but no business can supply one.
Because all businesses are man-made objects; all business is involved with money; all business is a matter of using machinery, and all those things make something inauthentic.
So, how do you render authenticity, is the question.
Are you rendering authenticity?
When you think about that, let me go back to what Lionel Trilling, in his seminal book on authenticity, "Sincerity and Authenticity" -- came out in 1960 -- points to as the seminal point at which authenticity entered the lexicon, if you will.
And that is, to no surprise, in Shakespeare, and in his play, Hamlet.
And there is one part in this play, Hamlet, where the most fake of all the characters in Hamlet, Polonius, says something profoundly real.
At the end of a laundry list of advice he's giving to his son, Laertes, he says this: And this above all: to thine own self be true.
And it doth follow, as night the day, that thou canst not then be false to any man.
And those three verses are the core of authenticity.
There are two dimensions to authenticity: one, being true to yourself, which is very self-directed.
Two, is other-directed: being what you say you are to others.
And I don't know about you, but whenever I encounter two dimensions, I immediately go, ahh, two-by-two!
All right? Anybody else like that, no?
Well, if you think about that, you do, in fact, get a two-by-two.
Where, on one dimension it's a matter of being true to yourself.
As businesses, are the economic offerings you are providing -- are they true to themselves?
And the other dimension is: are they what they say they are to others?
If not, you have, "is not true to itself," and "is not what it says it is," yielding a two-by-two matrix.
And of course, if you are both true to yourself, and are what you say you are, then you're real real!
(Laughter) The opposite, of course, is -- fake fake.
All right, now, there is value for fake.
There will always be companies around to supply the fake, because there will always be desire for the fake.
Fact is, there's a general rule: if you don't like it, it's fake; if you do like it, it's faux.
(Laughter) Now, the other two sides of the coin are: being a real fake -- is what it says it is, but is not true to itself, or being a fake real: is true to itself, but not what it says it is.
You can think about those two -- you know, both of these better than being fake fake -- not quite as good as being real real.
You can contrast them by thinking about Universal City Walk versus Disney World, or Disneyland.
Universal City Walk is a real fake -- in fact, we got this very term from Ada Louise Huxtable's book, "The Unreal America."
A wonderful book, where she talks about Universal City Walk as -- you know, she decries the fake, but she says, at least that's a real fake, right, because you can see behind the facade, right?
It is what it says it is: It's Universal Studio; it's in the city of Los Angeles; you're going to walk a lot.
Right? You don't tend to walk a lot in Los Angeles, well, here's a place where you are going to walk a lot, outside in this city.
But is it really true to itself?
Right? Is it really in the city?
Is it -- you can see behind all of it, and see what is going on in the facades of it.
So she calls it a real fake.
Disney World, on the other hand, is a fake real, or a fake reality.
Right? It's not what it says it is. It's not really the magic kingdom.
(Laughter) But it is -- oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to -- (Laughter) -- sorry.
We won't talk about Santa Claus then.
(Laughter) But Disney World is wonderfully true to itself.
Right? Just wonderfully true to itself.
When you are there you are just immersed in this wonderful environment.
So, it's a fake real.
Now the easiest way to fall down in this, and not be real real, right, the easiest way not to be true to yourself is not to understand your heritage, and thereby repudiate that heritage.
Right, the key of being true to yourself is knowing who you are as a business.
Knowing where your heritage is: what you have done in the past.
And what you have done in the past limits what you can do, what you can get away with, essentially, in the future.
So, you have to understand that past.
Think about Disney again.
Disney, 10 or 15 years ago, right, the Disney -- the company that is probably best-known for family values out there, Disney bought the ABC network.
The ABC network, affectionately known in the trade as the T&amp;A network, right -- that's not too much jargon, is it?
Right, the T&amp;A network. Then it bought Miramax, known for its NC-17 fare, and all of a sudden, families everywhere couldn't really trust what they were getting from Disney.
It was no longer true to its heritage; no longer true to Walt Disney.
That's one of the reasons why they're having such trouble today, and why Roy Disney is out to get Michael Eisner.
Because it is no longer true to itself.
So, understand what -- your past limits what you can do in the future.
When it comes to being what you say you are, the easiest mistake that companies make is that they advertise things that they are not.
That's when you're perceived as fake, as a phony company -- advertizing things that you're not.
Think about any hotel, any airline, any hospital.
Right, if you could check into the ads, you'd have a great experience.
(Laughter) But unfortunately, you have to experience the actual hotel, airline and hospital, and then you have that disconnect.
Then you have that perception that you are phony.
So, the number one thing to do when it comes to being what you say you are, is to provide places for people to experience who you are.
For people to experience who you are.
Right, it's not advertising does it.
That's why you have companies like Starbucks, right, that doesn't advertise at all.
They said, you want to know who we are, you have to come experience us.
And think about the economic value they have provided by that experience.
Right? Coffee, at its core, is what?
Right? It's beans; right? It's coffee beans.
You know how much coffee is worth, when treated as a commodity as a bean?
Two or three cents per cup -- that's what coffee is worth.
But grind it, roast it, package it, put it on a grocery store shelf, and now it'll cost five, 10, 15 cents, when you treat it as a good.
Take that same good, and perform the service of actually brewing it for a customer, in a corner diner, in a bodega, a kiosk somewhere, you get 50 cents, maybe a buck per cup of coffee.
But surround the brewing of that coffee with the ambiance of a Starbucks, with the authentic cedar that goes inside of there, and now, because of that authentic experience, you can charge two, three, four, five dollars for a cup of coffee.
So, authenticity is becoming the new consumer sensibility.
Let me summarize it, for the business people in the audience, with three rules, three basic rules.
One, don't say you're authentic unless you really are authentic.
Two, it's easier to be authentic if you don't say you're authentic.
And three, if you say you're authentic, you better be authentic.
And then for the consumers, for everyone else in the audience, let me simply summarize it by saying, increasingly, what we -- what will make us happy, is spending our time and our money satisfying the desire for authenticity.
Thank you.
I'm going to tell you about the most amazing machines in the world and what we can now do with them.
Proteins, some of which you see inside a cell here, carry out essentially all the important functions in our bodies.
Proteins digest your food, contract your muscles, fire your neurons and power your immune system.
Everything that happens in biology -- almost -- happens because of proteins.
Proteins are linear chains of building blocks called amino acids.
Nature uses an alphabet of 20 amino acids, some of which have names you may have heard of.
In this picture, for scale, each bump is an atom.
Chemical forces between the amino acids cause these long stringy molecules to fold up into unique, three-dimensional structures.
The folding process, while it looks random, is in fact very precise.
Each protein folds to its characteristic shape each time, and the folding process takes just a fraction of a second.
And it's the shapes of proteins which enable them to carry out their remarkable biological functions.
For example, hemoglobin has a shape in the lungs perfectly suited for binding a molecule of oxygen.
When hemoglobin moves to your muscle, the shape changes slightly and the oxygen comes out.
The shapes of proteins, and hence their remarkable functions, are completely specified by the sequence of amino acids in the protein chain.
In this picture, each letter on top is an amino acid.
Where do these sequences come from?
The genes in your genome specify the amino acid sequences of your proteins.
Each gene encodes the amino acid sequence of a single protein.
The translation between these amino acid sequences and the structures and functions of proteins is known as the protein folding problem.
It's a very hard problem because there's so many different shapes a protein can adopt.
Because of this complexity, humans have only been able to harness the power of proteins by making very small changes to the amino acid sequences of the proteins we've found in nature.
This is similar to the process that our Stone Age ancestors used to make tools and other implements from the sticks and stones that we found in the world around us.
But humans did not learn to fly by modifying birds.
(Laughter) Instead, scientists, inspired by birds, uncovered the principles of aerodynamics.
Engineers then used those principles to design custom flying machines.
In a similar way, we've been working for a number of years to uncover the fundamental principles of protein folding and encoding those principles in the computer program called Rosetta.
We made a breakthrough in recent years.
We can now design completely new proteins from scratch on the computer.
Once we've designed the new protein, we encode its amino acid sequence in a synthetic gene.
We have to make a synthetic gene because since the protein is completely new, there's no gene in any organism on earth which currently exists that encodes it.
Our advances in understanding protein folding and how to design proteins, coupled with the decreasing cost of gene synthesis and the Moore's law increase in computing power, now enable us to design tens of thousands of new proteins, with new shapes and new functions, on the computer, and encode each one of those in a synthetic gene.
Once we have those synthetic genes, we put them into bacteria to program them to make these brand-new proteins.
We then extract the proteins and determine whether they function as we designed them to and whether they're safe.
It's exciting to be able to make new proteins, because despite the diversity in nature, evolution has only sampled a tiny fraction of the total number of proteins possible.
I told you that nature uses an alphabet of 20 amino acids, and a typical protein is a chain of about 100 amino acids, so the total number of possibilities is 20 times 20 times 20, 100 times, which is a number on the order of 10 to the 130th power, which is enormously more than the total number of proteins which have existed since life on earth began.
And it's this unimaginably large space we can now explore using computational protein design.
Now the proteins that exist on earth evolved to solve the problems faced by natural evolution.
For example, replicating the genome.
But we face new challenges today.
We live longer, so new diseases are important.
We're heating up and polluting the planet, so we face a whole host of ecological challenges.
If we had a million years to wait, new proteins might evolve to solve those challenges.
But we don't have millions of years to wait.
Instead, with computational protein design, we can design new proteins to address these challenges today.
Our audacious idea is to bring biology out of the Stone Age through technological revolution in protein design.
We've already shown that we can design new proteins with new shapes and functions.
For example, vaccines work by stimulating your immune system to make a strong response against a pathogen.
To make better vaccines, we've designed protein particles to which we can fuse proteins from pathogens, like this blue protein here, from the respiratory virus RSV.
To make vaccine candidates that are literally bristling with the viral protein, we find that such vaccine candidates produce a much stronger immune response to the virus than any previous vaccines that have been tested.
This is important because RSV is currently one of the leading causes of infant mortality worldwide.
We've also designed new proteins to break down gluten in your stomach for celiac disease and other proteins to stimulate your immune system to fight cancer.
These advances are the beginning of the protein design revolution.
We've been inspired by a previous technological revolution: the digital revolution, which took place in large part due to advances in one place, Bell Laboratories.
Bell Labs was a place with an open, collaborative environment, and was able to attract top talent from around the world.
And this led to a remarkable string of innovations -- the transistor, the laser, satellite communication and the foundations of the internet.
Our goal is to build the Bell Laboratories of protein design.
We are seeking to attract talented scientists from around the world to accelerate the protein design revolution, and we'll be focusing on five grand challenges.
First, by taking proteins from flu strains from around the world and putting them on top of the designed protein particles I showed you earlier, we aim to make a universal flu vaccine, one shot of which gives a lifetime of protection against the flu.
The ability to design -- (Applause) The ability to design new vaccines on the computer is important both to protect against natural flu epidemics and, in addition, intentional acts of bioterrorism.
Second, we're going far beyond nature's limited alphabet of just 20 amino acids to design new therapeutic candidates for conditions such as chronic pain, using an alphabet of thousands of amino acids.
Third, we're building advanced delivery vehicles to target existing medications exactly where they need to go in the body.
For example, chemotherapy to a tumor or gene therapies to the tissue where gene repair needs to take place.
Fourth, we're designing smart therapeutics that can do calculations within the body and go far beyond current medicines, which are really blunt instruments.
For example, to target a small subset of immune cells responsible for an autoimmune disorder, and distinguish them from the vast majority of healthy immune cells.
Finally, inspired by remarkable biological materials such as silk, abalone shell, tooth and others, we're designing new protein-based materials to address challenges in energy and ecological issues.
To do all this, we're growing our institute.
We seek to attract energetic, talented and diverse scientists from around the world, at all career stages, to join us.
You can also participate in the protein design revolution through our online folding and design game, "Foldit."
And through our distributed computing project, Rosetta@home, which you can join from your laptop or your Android smartphone.
Making the world a better place through protein design is my life's work.
I'm so excited about what we can do together.
I hope you'll join us, and thank you.
(Applause and cheers)
My work is play.
And I play when I design.
I even looked it up in the dictionary, to make sure that I actually do that, and the definition of play, number one, was engaging in a childlike activity or endeavor, and number two was gambling.
And I realize I do both when I'm designing.
I'm both a kid and I'm gambling all the time.
And I think that if you're not, there's probably something inherently wrong with the structure or the situation you're in, if you're a designer.
But the serious part is what threw me, and I couldn't quite get a handle on it until I remembered an essay.
And it's an essay I read 30 years ago.
It was written by Russell Baker, who used to write an "Observer" column in the New York Times.
He's a wonderful humorist. And I'm going to read you this essay, or an excerpt from it because it really hit home for me.
Here is a letter of friendly advice.
Be serious, it says.
What it means, of course, is, be solemn.
Being solemn is easy.
Being serious is hard.
Children almost always begin by being serious, which is what makes them so entertaining when compared with adults as a class.
Adults, on the whole, are solemn.
In politics, the rare candidate who is serious, like Adlai Stevenson, is easily overwhelmed by one who is solemn, like Eisenhower.
That's because it is hard for most people to recognize seriousness, which is rare, but more comfortable to endorse solemnity, which is commonplace.
Jogging, which is commonplace, and widely accepted as good for you, is solemn.
Poker is serious.
Washington, D.C. is solemn.
New York is serious.
Going to educational conferences to tell you anything about the future is solemn.
Taking a long walk by yourself, during which you devise a foolproof scheme for robbing Tiffany's, is serious.
(Laughter) Now, when I apply Russell Baker's definition of solemnity or seriousness to design, it doesn't necessarily make any particular point about quality.
Solemn design is often important and very effective design.
Solemn design is also socially correct, and is accepted by appropriate audiences.
It's what right-thinking designers and all the clients are striving for.
Serious design, serious play, is something else.
For one thing, it often happens spontaneously, intuitively, accidentally or incidentally.
It can be achieved out of innocence, or arrogance, or out of selfishness, sometimes out of carelessness.
But mostly, it's achieved through all those kind of crazy parts of human behavior that don't really make any sense.
Serious design is imperfect.
It's filled with the kind of craft laws that come from something being the first of its kind.
Serious design is also -- often -- quite unsuccessful from the solemn point of view.
That's because the art of serious play is about invention, change, rebellion -- not perfection.
Perfection happens during solemn play.
Now, I always saw design careers like surreal staircases.
If you look at the staircase, you'll see that in your 20s the risers are very high and the steps are very short, and you make huge discoveries.
You sort of leap up very quickly in your youth.
That's because you don't know anything and you have a lot to learn, and so that anything you do is a learning experience and you're just jumping right up there.
As you get older, the risers get shallower and the steps get wider, and you start moving along at a slower pace because you're making fewer discoveries.
And as you get older and more decrepit, you sort of inch along on this sort of depressing, long staircase, leading you into oblivion.
(Laughter) I find it's actually getting really hard to be serious.
I'm hired to be solemn, but I find more and more that I'm solemn when I don't have to be.
And in my 35 years of working experience, I think I was really serious four times.
And I'm going to show them to you now, because they came out of very specific conditions.
It's great to be a kid.
Now, when I was in my early 20s, I worked in the record business, designing record covers for CBS Records, and I had no idea what a great job I had.
I thought everybody had a job like that.
And what -- the way I looked at design and the way I looked at the world was, what was going on around me and the things that came at the time I walked into design were the enemy.
I really, really, really hated the typeface Helvetica.
I thought the typeface Helvetica was the cleanest, most boring, most fascistic, really repressive typeface, and I hated everything that was designed in Helvetica.
And when I was in my college days, this was the sort of design that was fashionable and popular.
This is actually quite a lovely book jacket by Rudy de Harak, but I just hated it, because it was designed with Helvetica, and I made parodies about it.
I just thought it was, you know, completely boring.
(Laughter) So -- so, my goal in life was to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica.
And to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica was actually kind of hard because you had to find it.
And there weren't a lot of books about the history of design in the early 70s. There weren't -- there wasn't a plethora of design publishing.
You actually had to go to antique stores. You had to go to Europe.
You had to go places and find the stuff.
And what I responded to was, you know, Art Nouveau, or deco, or Victorian typography, or things that were just completely not Helvetica.
And I taught myself design this way, and this was sort of my early years, and I used these things in really goofy ways on record covers and in my design.
I wasn't educated. I just sort of put these things together.
I mixed up Victorian designs with pop, and I mixed up Art Nouveau with something else.
And I made these very lush, very elaborate record covers, not because I was being a post-modernist or a historicist -- because I didn't know what those things were.
I just hated Helvetica.
(Laughter) And that kind of passion drove me into very serious play, a kind of play I could never do now because I'm too well-educated.
And there's something wonderful about that form of youth, where you can let yourself grow and play, and be really a brat, and then accomplish things.
By the end of the '70s, actually, the stuff became known.
I mean, these covers appeared all over the world, and they started winning awards, and people knew them.
And I was suddenly a post-modernist, and I began a career as -- in my own business.
And first I was praised for it, then criticized for it, but the fact of the matter was, I had become solemn.
I didn't do what I think was a piece of serious work again for about 14 years.
I spent most of the '80s being quite solemn, turning out these sorts of designs that I was expected to do because that's who I was, and I was living in this cycle of going from serious to solemn to hackneyed to dead, and getting rediscovered all over again.
So, here was the second condition for which I think I accomplished some serious play.
There's a Paul Newman movie that I love called "The Verdict."
I don't know how many of you have seen it, but it's a beaut.
And in the movie, he plays a down-and-out lawyer who's become an ambulance chaser.
And he's taken on -- he's given, actually -- a malpractice suit to handle that's sort of an easy deal, and in the midst of trying to connect the deal, he starts to empathize and identify with his client, and he regains his morality and purpose, and he goes on to win the case.
And in the depth of despair, in the midst of the movie, when it looks like he can't pull this thing off, and he needs this case, he needs to win this case so badly.
There's a shot of Paul Newman alone, in his office, saying, "This is the case. There are no other cases.
This is the case. There are no other cases."
And in that moment of desire and focus, he can win.
And that is a wonderful position to be in to create some serious play.
And I had that moment in 1994 when I met a theater director named George Wolfe, who was going to have me design an identity for the New York Shakespeare Festival, then known, and then became the Public Theater.
And I began getting immersed in this project in a way I never was before.
This is what theater advertising looked like at that time.
This is what was in the newspapers and in the New York Times.
So, this is sort of a comment on the time.
And the Public Theater actually had much better advertising than this.
They had no logo and no identity, but they had these very iconic posters painted by Paul Davis.
And George Wolf had taken over from another director and he wanted to change the theater, and he wanted to make it urban and loud and a place that was inclusive.
So, drawing on my love of typography, I immersed myself into this project.
And what was different about it was the totality of it, was that I really became the voice, the visual voice, of a place in a way I had never done before, where every aspect -- the smallest ad, the ticket, whatever it was -- was designed by me.
There was no format.
There was no in-house department that these things were pushed to.
I literally for three years made everything -- every scrap of paper, everything online, that this theater did.
And it was the only job, even though I was doing other jobs.
I lived and breathed it in a way I haven't with a client since.
It enabled me to really express myself and grow.
And I think that you know when you're going to be given this position, and it's rare, but when you get it and you have this opportunity, it's the moment of serious play.
I did these things, and I still do them.
I still work for the Public Theater.
I'm on their board, and I still am involved with it.
The high point of the Public Theater, I think, was in 1996, two years after I designed it, which was the "Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk" campaign that was all over New York.
But something happened to it, and what happened to it was, it became very popular.
And that is a kiss of death for something serious because it makes it solemn.
And what happened was that New York City, to a degree, ate my identity because people began to copy it.
Here's an ad in the New York Times somebody did for a play called "Mind Games."
Then "Chicago" came out, used similar graphics, and the Public Theater's identity was just totally eaten and taken away, which meant I had to change it.
So, I changed it so that every season was different, and I continued to do these posters, but they never had the seriousness of the first identity because they were too individual, and they didn't have that heft of everything being the same thing.
Now -- and I think since the Public Theater, I must have done more than a dozen cultural identities for major institutions, and I don't think I ever -- I ever grasped that seriousness again -- I do them for very big, important institutions in New York City.
The institutions are solemn, and so is the design.
They're better crafted than the Public Theater was, and they spend more money on them, but I think that that moment comes and goes.
The best way to accomplish serious design -- which I think we all have the opportunity to do -- is to be totally and completely unqualified for the job.
That doesn't happen very often, but it happened to me in the year 2000, when for some reason or another, a whole pile of different architects started to ask me to design the insides of theaters with them, where I would take environmental graphics and work them into buildings.
I'd never done this kind of work before.
I didn't know how to read an architectural plan, I didn't know what they were talking about, and I really couldn't handle the fact that a job -- a single job -- could go on for four years because I was used to immediacy in graphic design, and that kind of attention to detail was really bad for somebody like me, with ADD.
So, it was a rough -- it was a rough go, but I fell in love with this process of actually integrating graphics into architecture because I didn't know what I was doing.
I said, "Why can't the signage be on the floor?"
New Yorkers look at their feet.
And then I found that actors and actresses actually take their cues from the floor, so it turned out that these sorts of sign systems began to make sense.
They integrated with the building in really peculiar ways.
They ran around corners, they went up sides of buildings, and they melded into the architecture.
This is Symphony Space on 90th Street and Broadway, and the type is interwoven into the stainless steel and backlit with fiber optics.
And the architect, Jim Polshek, essentially gave me a canvas to play typography out on.
And it was serious play.
This is the children's museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, made out of completely inexpensive materials.
Extruded typography that's backlit with neon.
Things I never did before, built before.
I just thought they'd be kind of fun to do.
Donors' walls made out of Lucite.
And then, inexpensive signage.
(Laughter) I think my favorite of these was this little job in Newark, New Jersey.
It's a performing arts school.
This is the building that -- they had no money, and they had to recast it, and they said, if we give you 100,000 dollars, what can you do with it?
And I did a little Photoshop job on it, and I said, Well, I think we can paint it.
And we did. And it was play.
And there's the building. Everything was painted -- typography over the whole damn thing, including the air conditioning ducts.
I hired guys who paint flats fixed on the sides of garages to do the painting on the building, and they loved it.
They got into it -- they took the job incredibly seriously.
They used to climb up on the building and call me and tell me that they had to correct my typography -- that my spacing was wrong, and they moved it, and they did wonderful things with it.
They were pretty serious, too. It was quite wonderful.
By the time I did Bloomberg's headquarters my work had begun to become accepted.
People wanted it in big, expensive places.
And that began to make it solemn.
Bloomberg was all about numbers, and we did big numbers through the space and the numbers were projected on a spectacular LED that my partner, Lisa Strausfeld, programmed.
But it became the end of the seriousness of the play, and it started to, once again, become solemn.
This is a current project in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where I got to be goofy.
I was invited to design a logo for this neighborhood, called the North Side, and I thought it was silly for a neighborhood to have a logo.
I think that's rather creepy, actually. Why would a neighborhood have a logo?
A neighborhood has a thing -- it's got a landmark, it's got a place, it's got a restaurant. It doesn't have a logo. I mean, what would that be?
So I had to actually give a presentation to a city council and neighborhood constituents, and I went to Pittsburgh and I said, "You know, really what you have here are all these underpasses that separate the neighborhood from the center of town.
Why don't you celebrate them, and make the underpasses landmarks?"
So I began doing this crazy presentation of these installations -- potential installations -- on these underpass bridges, and stood up in front of the city council -- and was a little bit scared, I have to admit.
But I was so utterly unqualified for this project, and so utterly ridiculous, and ignored the brief so desperately that I think they just embraced it with wholeheartedness, just completely because it was so goofy to begin with.
And this is the bridge they're actually painting up and preparing as we speak.
It will change every six months, and it will become an art installation in the North Side of Pittsburgh, and it will probably become a landmark in the area.
John Hockenberry told you a bit about my travail with Citibank, that is now a 10-year relationship, and I still work with them.
And I actually am amused by them and like them, and think that as a very, very, very, very, very big corporation they actually keep their graphics very nice.
I drew the logo for Citibank on a napkin in the first meeting.
That was the play part of the job.
And then I spent a year going to long, tedious, boring meetings, trying to sell this logo through to a huge corporation to the point of tears.
I thought I was going to go crazy at the end of this year.
We made idiotic presentations showing how the Citi logo made sense, and how it was really derived from an umbrella, and we made animations of these things, and we came back and forth and back and forth and back and forth.
And it was worth it, because they bought this thing, and it played out on such a grand scale, and it's so internationally recognizable, but for me it was actually a very, very depressing year.
As a matter of fact, they actually never bought onto the logo until Fallon put it on its very good "Live Richly" campaign, and then everybody accepted it all over the world.
So during this time I needed some kind of counterbalance for this crazy, crazy existence of going to these long, idiotic meetings.
And I was up in my country house, and for some reason, I began painting these very big, very involved, laborious, complicated maps of the entire world, and listing every place on the planet, and putting them in, and misspelling them, and putting things in the wrong spot, and completely controlling the information, and going totally and completely nuts with it.
They would take me about six months initially, but then I started getting faster at it.
Here's the United States.
Every single city of the United States is on here.
And it hung for about eight months at the Cooper-Hewitt, and people walked up to it, and they would point to a part of the map and they'd say, "Oh, I've been here."
And, of course, they couldn't have been because it's in the wrong spot.
(Laughter) But what I liked about it was, I was controlling my own idiotic information, and I was creating my own palette of information, and I was totally and completely at play.
One of my favorites was this painting I did of Florida after the 2000 election that has the election results rolling around in the water.
I keep that for evidence.
(Laughter) Somebody was up at my house and saw the paintings and recommended them to a gallery, and I had a first show about two-and-a-half years ago, and I showed these paintings that I'm showing you now.
And then a funny thing happened -- they sold.
And they sold quickly, and became rather popular.
We started making prints from them.
This is Manhattan, one from the series.
This is a print from the United States which we did in red, white and blue.
We began doing these big silkscreen prints, and they started selling, too.
So, the gallery wanted me to have another show in two years, which meant that I really had to paint these paintings much faster than I had ever done them. And I -- they started to become more political, and I picked areas that sort of were in the news or that I had some feeling about, and I began doing these things.
And then this funny thing happened.
I found that I was no longer at play.
I was actually in this solemn landscape of fulfilling an expectation for a show, which is not where I started with these things.
So, while they became successful, I know how to make them, so I'm not a neophyte, and they're no longer serious -- they have become solemn.
And that's a terrifying factor -- when you start something and it turns that way -- because it means that all that's left for you is to go back and to find out what the next thing is that you can push, that you can invent, that you can be ignorant about, that you can be arrogant about, that you can fail with, and that you can be a fool with.
Because in the end, that's how you grow, and that's all that matters.
So, I'm plugging along here -- (Laughter) and I'm just going to have to blow up the staircase.
Thank you very much.
I had requested slides, kind of adamantly, up till the -- pretty much, last few days, but was denied access to a slide projector.
(Laughter) I actually find them a lot more emotional -- (Laughter) -- and personal, and the neat thing about a slide projector is you can actually focus the work, unlike PowerPoint and some other programs.
Now, I agree that you have to -- yeah, there are certain concessions and, you know, if you use a slide projector, you're not able to have the bad type swing in from the back or the side, or up or down, but maybe that's an O.K. trade-off, to trade that off for a focus.
(Laughter) It's a thought. Just a thought.
And there's something nice about slides getting stuck.
And the thing you really hope for is occasionally they burn up, which we won't see tonight. So.
With that, let's get the first slide up here.
This, as many of you have probably guessed, is a recently emptied beer can in Portugal.
(Laughter) This -- I had just arrived in Barcelona for the first time, and I thought -- you know, fly all night, I looked up, and I thought, wow, how clean.
You come into this major airport, and they simply have a B.
I mean, how nice is that?
Everything's gotten simpler in design, and here's this mega airport, and God, I just -- I took a picture.
I thought, God, that is the coolest thing I've ever seen at an airport.
Till a couple months later, I went back to the same airport -- same plane, I think -- and looked up, and it said C.
(Laughter) It was only then that I realized it was simply a gate that I was coming into.
(Laughter) I'm a big believer in the emotion of design, and the message that's sent before somebody begins to read, before they get the rest of the information; what is the emotional response they get to the product, to the story, to the painting -- whatever it is.
That area of design interests me the most, and I think this for me is a real clear, very simplified version of what I'm talking about.
These are a couple of garage doors painted identical, situated next to each other.
So, here's the first door. You know, you get the message.
You know, it's pretty clear.
Take a look at the second door and see if there's any different message.
O.K., which one would you park in front of?
(Laughter) Same color, same message, same words.
The only thing that's different is the expression that the individual door-owner here put into the piece -- and, again, which is the psycho-killer here?
(Laughter) Yet it doesn't say that; it doesn't need to say that.
I would probably park in front of the other one.
I'm sure a lot of you are aware that graphic design has gotten a lot simpler in the last five years or so.
It's gotten so simple that it's already starting to kind of come back the other way again and get a little more expressive.
But I was in Milan and saw this street sign, and was very happy to see that apparently this idea of minimalism has even been translated by the graffiti artist.
(Laughter) And this graffiti artist has come along, made this sign a little bit better, and then moved on.
(Laughter) He didn't overpower it like they have a tendency to do.
(Laughter) This is for a book by "Metropolis."
I took some photos, and this is a billboard in Florida, and either they hadn't paid their rent, or they didn't want to pay their rent again on the sign, and the billboard people were too cheap to tear the whole sign down, so they just teared out sections of it.
And I would argue that it's possibly more effective than the original billboard in terms of getting your attention, getting you to look over that way.
And hopefully you don't stop and buy those awful pecan things -- Stuckey's.
This is from my second book.
The first book is called, "The End of Print," and it was done along with a film, working with William Burroughs.
And "The End of Print" is now in its fifth printing.
(Laughter) When I first contacted William Burroughs about being part of it, he said no; he said he didn't believe it was the end of print.
And I said, well, that's fine; I just would love to have your input on this film and this book, and he finally agreed to it.
And at the end of the film, he says in this great voice that I can't mimic but I'll kind of try, but not really, he says, "I remember attending an exhibition called, 'Photography: The End of Painting.'" And then he says, "And, of course, it wasn't at all."
So, apparently when photography was perfected, there were people going around saying, that's it: you've just ruined painting.
People are just going to take pictures now.
And of course, that wasn't the case.
So, this is from "2nd Sight," a book I did on intuition.
I think it's not the only ingredient in design, but possibly the most important.
It's something everybody has.
It's not a matter of teaching it; in fact, most of the schools tend to discount intuition as an ingredient of your working process because they can't quantify it: it's very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design, but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card or a newsletter.
So it tends to get discounted.
This is a quote from Albert Einstein, who says, "The intellect has little to do on the road to discovery.
There comes a leap in consciousness -- call it intuition or what you will -- and the solution just comes to you, and you don't know from where or why."
So, it's kind of like when somebody says, Who did that song?
And the more you try to think about it, the further the answer gets from you, and the minute you stop thinking about it, your intuition gives you that answer, in a sense.
I like this for a couple of reasons.
If you've had any design courses, they would teach you you can't read this.
I think you eventually can and, more importantly, I think it's true.
"Don't mistake legibility for communication."
Just because something's legible doesn't means it communicates.
More importantly, it doesn't mean it communicates the right thing.
So, what is the message sent before somebody actually gets into the material?
And I think that's sometimes an overlooked area.
This is working with Marshall McLuhan.
I stayed and worked with his wife and son, Eric, and we came up with close to 600 quotes from Marshall that are just amazing in terms of being ahead of the times, predicting so much of what has happened in the advertising, television, media world.
And so this book is called "Probes." It's another word for quotes.
And it's -- a lot of them are never -- have never been published before, and basically, I've interpreted the different quotes.
So, this was the contents page originally.
When I got done it was 540 pages, and then the publisher, Gingko Press, ended up cutting it down considerably: it's just under 400 pages now.
But I decided I liked this contents page -- I liked the way it looks -- so I kept it.
(Laughter) It now has no relevance to the book whatsoever, but it's a nice spread, I think, in there.
(Laughter) So, a couple spreads from the book: here McLuhan says, "The new media are not bridges between Man and Nature; they are Nature."
"The invention of printing did away with anonymity, fostering ideas of literary fame and the habit of considering intellectual effort as private property," which had never been done before printing.
"When new technologies impose themselves on societies long habituated to older technologies, anxieties of all kinds result."
"While people are engaged in creating a totally different world, they always form vivid images of the preceding world."
I hate this stuff. It's hard to read.
(Laughter) (Applause) "People in the electronic age have no possible environment except the globe, and no possible occupation except information gathering."
That was it. That's all he saw as the options. And not too far off.
So, this is a project for Nine Inch Nails.
And I only show it because it seemed like it got all this relevancy all of a sudden, and it was done right after 9/11.
And I had recently discovered a bomb shelter in the backyard of a house I had bought in LA that the real estate person hadn't pointed out.
(Laughter) There was some bomb shelter built, apparently in the '60s Cuban missile crisis.
And I asked the real estate guy what it was as we were walking by, and he goes, "It's something to do with the sewage system."
I was, O.K.; that's fine.
I finally went down there, and it was this old rusted circular thing, and two beds, and very kind of creepy and weird.
And also, surprisingly, it was done in kind of a cheap metal, and it had completely rusted through, and water everywhere, and spiders.
And I thought, you know, what were they thinking?
You'd think maybe cement, possibly, or something.
But anyway, I used this for a cover for the Nine Inch Nails DVD, and I've also now fixed the bomb shelter with duct tape, and it's ready. I think I'm ready. So.
This is an experiment, really, for a client, Quicksilver, where we were taking what was a six-shot sequence and trying to use print as a medium to get people to the Web.
So, this is a six-shot sequence.
I've taken one shot; I cropped it a few different ways.
And then the tiny line of copy says, If you want to see this entire sequence -- how this whole ride was -- go to the website.
And my guess is that a lot of the surf kids did go to the site to get this entire picture.
Got no way of tracking it, so I could be totally wrong.
(Laughter) I don't have the site. It's just the piece itself.
This is a group in New York called the Coalition for a Smoke-free Environment -- asked me to do these posters.
They were wild-posted around New York City.
You can't really -- well, you can't see it at all -- but the second line is really the more kind of payoff, in a sense.
It says, "If the cigarette companies can lie, then so can we." But -- (Laughter) (Applause) -- but I did.
These were literally wild-posted all over New York one night, and there were definitely some heads turning, you know, people smoking and, "Huh!"
(Laughter) And it was purposely done to look fairly serious.
It wasn't some, you know, weird grunge type or something; it looked like they might be real. Anyway.
Poster for Atlantic Center for the Arts, a school in Florida.
This amazes me. This is a product I just found out.
I was in the Caribbean at Christmas, and I'm just blown away that in this day and age they will still sell -- not that they will sell -- that there is felt a need for people to lighten the color of their skin.
This was either an old product with new packaging, or a brand-new package, and I just thought, Yikes! How's that still happening?
I do a lot of workshops all over the world, really, and this particular assignment was to come up with new symbols for the restroom doors.
(Laughter) I felt this was one of the more successful solutions.
The students actually cut them up and put them up around bars and restaurants that night, and I just always have this vision of this elderly couple going to use the restroom ...
(Laughter) I did some work for Microsoft a few years back.
It was a worldwide branding campaign.
And it was interesting to me -- my background is in sociology; I had no design training, and sometimes people say, well, that explains it -- but it was a very interesting experiment because there's no product that I had to sell; it was simply the image of Microsoft they were trying to improve.
They thought some people didn't like them.
(Laughter) I found out that's very true, working on this campaign worldwide.
And our goal was to try to humanize them a bit, and what I did was add type and people to the ad, which the previous campaign had not had, and nobody remembered them, and nobody referenced them.
And we were trying to say that, hey, some of these guys that work there are actually OK; some of them actually have friends and family, and they're not all awful people.
And the umbrella campaign was "Thank God it's Monday."
So, we tried to take this -- what was perceived as a negative: their over-competitiveness, their, you know, long working hours -- and turn it into a positive and not run from it.
You know: Thank God it's Monday -- I get to go back to that little cubicle, those fake gray walls, and hear everybody else's conversations f or 10 hours and then go home.
But anyway, this is one of the ads I was most pleased with, because they were all elaborately art-directed, and this one I thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer.
It says, "Wonder Around." And then it's a piece of the software.
And this is how the ad ran around the world.
In Germany, they made one small change without checking with me -- nor did they have to, because it was done through agencies -- but see if you can tell the difference.
This is how the ad ran throughout the world; Germany made one slight change in the ad.
(Laughter) Now, there's kind of two issues here.
If you're going to put a kid in the ad, pick one that looks alive.
(Laughter) I just have a feeling this kid's been there for a week, you know.
He's just really hoping that boots up and, you know ...
(Laughter) And then as the agency explained to me, they said, "Look, we don't have little green people in our country; why would we put little green people in our ads, for instance?"
So, I understand their logic. I totally disagree with it; I think it's a very small-minded approach, the world is certainly much more global, and I certainly think the people of Germany could have handled a little black girl sitting in front of a computer, though we'll never know.
This is some work from Ray Gun.
And the point of this magazine was to read the articles, listen to the music, and try to interpret it.
There's no grid, there's no system, there's nothing set up in advance.
This is an opener for Brian Eno, and it's just kind of my personal interpretation of the music.
This is rockstars talking about teachers they had lusted after in school.
There's a lot of great writing in "Ray Gun."
And I was fortunate to find a photograph of a teacher sitting on some books.
(Laughter) Article on Bryan Ferry -- just really boring article -- so I set the whole article in Dingbat.
(Laughter) You could -- you could highlight it; you could make it Helvetica or something: it is the actual article.
I suppose you could eventually decode it, but it's really not very well written; it really wouldn't be worthwhile.
(Laughter) Having done a lot of magazines, I'm very curious how big magazines handle big stories, and I was very curious to see how Time and Newsweek would handle 9/11.
And I was basically pretty disappointed to see that they had chosen to show the photo we'd already seen a million times, which was basically the moment of impact.
And People magazine, I thought, got probably the best shot.
It's kind of horsey type, but the texture -- the second plane not quite hitting: there was something more enticing, if that's the right -- it's not the right word -- but in this cover than Time or Newsweek.
But when I got into this magazine, there's something kind of disturbing, and this continued.
On the left we see people dying; we see people running for their lives.
And on the right we learn that there's a new way to support your breast.
The coveted right-hand page was not given up to the whole issue.
Look at the image of this lady -- who knows what she's going through? -- and the copy says: "He knows just how to give me goosebumps."
Yeah, he jumps out of buildings. It's -- unfortunately, this one works, kind of, as a spread.
And this continued through the entire magazine.
It did not let up.
This says: "One clean fits all." .
There were a lot of orphans made this day, and here's a dead body being brought out.
It just seems to me possibly even a blank page would have been more appropriate.
And this one I think is possibly the worst: two ladies, both facing the same way, both wearing jeans.
One -- who knows what she's going through; the other one is worried about model behavior and milk.
And -- I gave a talk in New York a couple months after this, and afterwards somebody came up to me and they said that -- they actually emailed me -- and they said that they appreciated the talk, and when they got back to their car, they found a note on their car that made them think maybe New York was getting back to being New York again after this event -- it had been a few months.
This was what they found on their car.
(Laughter) There's very few times you'd be happy to find this on your car, but it did seem to indicate that we were coming back.
This is my desktop.
Somebody told me today there was this thing called folders, but I don't know what they are.
These are my notes for the talk -- there might be a correlation here.
We are wrapping up.
This I saw on the plane, flying in, for hot new products.
I'm not sure this is an improvement, or a good idea, because, like, if you don't spend quite enough time in front of your computer, you can now get a plate in the keyboard, so there's no more faking it -- that you don't really sit at your desk all day and eat and work anyway.
Now there's a plate, and it would be really, really convenient to get a piece of pizza, then type a little bit, then ...
I'm just not sure this is improvement.
If you ever doubt the power of graphic design, this is a very generic sign that literally says, "Vote for Hitler." It says nothing else.
And this to me is an extreme case of the power of emotion, of graphic design, even though, in fact, was a very generic poster at the time.
What's next? What's next is going to be people.
As we get more technically driven, the importance of people becomes more than it's ever been before.
You have to utilize who you are in your work.
Nobody else can do that: nobody else can pull from your background, from your parents, your upbringing, your whole life experience.
If you allow that to happen, it's really the only way you can do some unique work, and you're going to enjoy the work a lot more as well.
This is -- I like found art; hand lettering's coming back in a big way, and I thought this was a great example of both.
This lady's advertising for her lost pit bull.
It's friendly -- she's underlined friendly -- that's probably why she calls it Hercules or Hercles. She can't spell.
(Laughter) But more importantly, she's willing to give you 20 bucks to go find this lost pit bull.
And I'm thinking, yeah, right, I'll go look for a lost pit bill for 20 bucks.
I have visions of people going down alleyways yelling out for Hercles, and you get charged by this thing and you go, oh, please be Hercles; please be the friendly one.
(Laughter) I'm sure she never found the dog, because I took the sign.
(Laughter) But I was asked to give a talk at a conference in Sacramento a few years back.
And the theme was courage, and they asked me to talk about how courageous it is to be a graphic designer.
And I remembered seeing this photograph of my father, who was a test pilot, and he told me that when you signed up to become a test pilot, they told you that there was a 40 to 50 percent chance of death on the job.
That's pretty high for most occupations.
(Laughter) But, you know, the government would make a plane; they'd say, go see if that one flies, would you?
Some of them did; some of them didn't.
And I started thinking about some of these decisions I have to make between, like, serif versus san-serif.
(Laughter) And for the most part, they're not real life-threatening.
Why not experiment? Why not have some fun?
Why not put some of yourself into the work?
And when I was teaching, I used to always ask the students, What's the definition of a good job?
And as teachers, after you get all the answers, you like to give them the correct answer.
And the best one I've heard -- I'm sure some of you have heard this -- the definition of a good job is: If you could afford to -- if money wasn't an issue -- would you be doing that same work?
And if you would, you've got a great job.
And if you wouldn't, what the heck are you doing?
You're going to be dead a really long time.
Thank you very much.
What's happening in genomics, and how this revolution is about to change everything we know about the world, life, ourselves, and how we think about them.
If you saw 2001: A Space Odyssey, and you heard the boom, boom, boom, boom, and you saw the monolith, you know, that was Arthur C. Clarke's representation that we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species.
In this case, it was picking up bones and creating a tool, using it as a tool, which meant that apes just, sort of, running around and eating and doing each other figured out they can make things if they used a tool.
And that moved us to the next level.
And, you know, we in the last 30 years in particular have seen this acceleration in knowledge and technology, and technology has bred more knowledge and given us tools.
And we've seen many seminal moments.
We've seen the creation of small computers in the '70s and early '80s, and who would have thought back then that every single person would not have just one computer but probably 20, in your home, and in not just your P.C. but in every device -- in your washing machine, your cell phone.
You're walking around; your car has 12 microprocessors.
Then we go along and create the Internet and connect the world together; we flatten the world.
We've seen so much change, and we've given ourselves these tools now -- these high-powered tools -- that are allowing us to turn the lens inward into something that is common to all of us, and that is a genome.
How's your genome today? Have you thought about it lately?
Heard about it, at least? You probably hear about genomes these days.
I thought I'd take a moment to tell you what a genome is.
It's, sort of, like if you ask people, Well, what is a megabyte or megabit? And what is broadband?
People never want to say, I really don't understand.
So, I will tell you right off of the bat.
You've heard of DNA; you probably studied a little bit in biology.
A genome is really a description for all of the DNA that is in a living organism.
And one thing that is common to all of life is DNA.
It doesn't matter whether you're a yeast; it doesn't matter whether you're a mouse; doesn't matter whether you're a fly; we all have DNA.
The DNA is organized in words, call them: genes and chromosomes.
And when Watson and Crick in the '50s first decoded this beautiful double helix that we know as the DNA molecule -- very long, complicated molecule -- we then started on this journey to understand that inside of that DNA is a language that determines the characteristics, our traits, what we inherit, what diseases we may get.
We've also along the way discovered that this is a very old molecule, that all of the DNA in your body has been around forever, since the beginning of us, of us as creatures.
There is a historical archive.
Living in your genome is the history of our species, and you as an individual human being, where you're from, going back thousands and thousands and thousands of years, and that's now starting to be understood.
But also, the genome is really the instruction manual.
It is the program. It is the code of life.
It is what makes you function; it is what makes every organism function.
DNA is a very elegant molecule.
It's long and it's complicated.
Really all you have to know about it is that there's four letters: A, T, C, G; they represent the name of a chemical.
And with these four letters, you can create a language: a language that can describe anything, and very complicated things.
You know, they are generally put together in pairs, creating a word or what we call base pairs.
And you would, you know, when you think about it, four letters, or the representation of four things, makes us work.
And that may not sound very intuitive, but let me flip over to something else you know about, and that's computers.
Look at this screen here and, you know, you see pictures and you see words, but really all there are are ones and zeros.
The language of technology is binary; you've probably heard that at some point in time.
Everything that happens in digital is converted, or a representation, of a one and a zero.
So, when you're listening to iTunes and your favorite music, that's really just a bunch of ones and zeros playing very quickly.
When you're seeing these pictures, it's all ones and zeros, and when you're talking on your telephone, your cell phone, and it's going over the network, your voice is all being turned into ones and zeros and magically whizzed around.
And look at all the complex things and wonderful things we've been able to create with just a one and a zero.
Well, now you ramp that up to four, and you have a lot of complexity, a lot of ways to describe mechanisms.
So, let's talk about what that means.
So, if you look at a human genome, they consist of 3.2 billion of these base pairs. That's a lot.
And they mix up in all different fashions, and that makes you a human being.
If you convert that to binary, just to give you a little bit of sizing, we're actually smaller than the program Microsoft Office.
It's not really all that much data.
I will also tell you we're at least as buggy.
(Laughter) This here is a bug in my genome that I have struggled with for a long, long time.
When you get sick, it is a bug in your genome.
In fact, many, many diseases we have struggled with for a long time, like cancer, we haven't been able to cure because we just don't understand how it works at the genomic level.
We are starting to understand that.
So, up to this point we tried to fix it by using what I call shit-against-the-wall pharmacology, which means, well, let's just throw chemicals at it, and maybe it's going to make it work.
But if you really understand why does a cell go from normal cell to cancer?
What is the code?
What are the exact instructions that are making it do that?
then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out.
So, for your next dinner over a great bottle of wine, here's a few factoids for you.
We actually have about 24,000 genes that do things.
We have about a hundred, 120,000 others that don't appear to function every day, but represent this archival history of how we used to work as a species going back tens of thousands of years.
You might also be interested in knowing that a mouse has about the same amount of genes.
They recently sequenced Pinot Noir, and it also has about 30,000 genes, so the number of genes you have may not necessarily represent the complexity or the evolutionary order of any particular species.
Now, look around: just look next to your neighbor, look forward, look backward. We all look pretty different.
A lot of very handsome and pretty people here, skinny, chubby, different races, cultures. We are all 99.9% genetically equal.
It is one one-hundredth of one percent of genetic material that makes the difference between any one of us.
That's a tiny amount of material, but the way that ultimately expresses itself is what makes changes in humans and in all species.
So, we are now able to read genomes.
The first human genome took 10 years, three billion dollars.
It was done by Dr. Craig Venter.
And then James Watson's -- one of the co-founders of DNA -- genome was done for two million dollars, and in just two months.
And if you think about the computer industry and how we've gone from big computers to little ones and how they get more powerful and faster all the time, the same thing is happening with gene sequencing now: we are on the cusp of being able to sequence human genomes for about 5,000 dollars in about an hour or a half-hour; you will see that happen in the next five years.
And what that means is, you are going to walk around with your own personal genome on a smart card. It will be here.
And when you buy medicine, you won't be buying a drug that's used for everybody.
You will give your genome to the pharmacist, and your drug will be made for you and it will work much better than the ones that were -- you won't have side effects.
All those side effects, you know, oily residue and, you know, whatever they say in those commercials: forget about that.
They're going to make all that stuff go away.
What does a genome look like?
Well, there it is. It is a long, long series of these base pairs.
If you saw the genome for a mouse or for a human it would look no different than this, but what scientists are doing now is they're understanding what these do and what they mean.
Because what Nature is doing is double-clicking all the time.
In other words, the first couple of sentences here, assuming this is a grape plant: make a root, make a branch, create a blossom.
In a human being, down in here it could be: make blood cells, start cancer.
For me it may be: every calorie you consume, you conserve, because I come from a very cold climate.
For my wife: eat three times as much and you never put on any weight.
It's all hidden in this code, and it's starting to be understood at breakneck pace.
So, what can we do with genomes now that we can read them, now that we're starting to have the book of life?
Well, there's many things. Some are exciting.
Some people will find very scary. I will tell you a couple of things that will probably make you want to projectile puke on me, but that's okay.
So, you know, we now can learn the history of organisms.
You can do a very simple test: scrape your cheek; send it off.
You can find out where your relatives come from; you can do your genealogy going back thousands of years.
We can understand functionality. This is really important.
We can understand, for example, why we create plaque in our arteries, what creates the starchiness inside of a grain, why does yeast metabolize sugar and produce carbon dioxide.
We can also look at, at a grander scale, what creates problems, what creates disease, and how we may be able to fix them.
Because we can understand this, we can fix them, make better organisms.
Most importantly, what we're learning is that Nature has provided us a spectacular toolbox.
The toolbox exists.
An architect far better and smarter than us has given us that toolbox, and we now have the ability to use it.
We are now not just reading genomes; we are writing them.
This company, Synthetic Genomics, I'm involved with, created the first full synthetic genome for a little bug, a very primitive creature called Mycoplasma genitalium.
If you have a UTI, you've probably -- or ever had a UTI -- you've come in contact with this little bug.
Very simple -- only has about 246 genes -- but we were able to completely synthesize that genome.
Now, you have the genome and you say to yourself, So, if I plug this synthetic genome -- if I pull the old one out and plug it in -- does it just boot up and live?
Well, guess what. It does.
Not only does it do that; if you took the genome -- that synthetic genome -- and you plugged it into a different critter, like yeast, you now turn that yeast into Mycoplasma.
It's, sort of, like booting up a PC with a Mac O.S. software.
Well, actually, you could do it the other way.
So, you know, by being able to write a genome and plug it into an organism, the software, if you will, changes the hardware.
And this is extremely profound.
So, last year the French and Italians announced they got together and they went ahead and they sequenced Pinot Noir.
The genomic sequence now exists for the entire Pinot Noir organism, and they identified, once again, about 29,000 genes.
They have discovered pathways that create flavors, although it's very important to understand that those compounds that it's cranking out have to match a receptor in our genome, in our tongue, for us to understand and interpret those flavors.
They've also discovered that there's a heck of a lot of activity going on producing aroma as well.
They've identified areas of vulnerability to disease.
They now are understanding, and the work is going on, exactly how this plant works, and we have the capability to know, to read that entire code and understand how it ticks.
So, then what do you do?
Knowing that we can read it, knowing that we can write it, change it, maybe write its genome from scratch. So, what do you do?
Well, one thing you could do is what some people might call Franken-Noir.
(Laughter) We can build a better vine.
By the way, just so you know: you get stressed out about genetically modified organisms; there is not one single vine in this valley or anywhere that is not genetically modified.
They're not grown from seeds; they're grafted into root stock; they would not exist in nature on their own.
So, don't worry about, don't stress about that stuff. We've been doing this forever.
So, we could, you know, focus on disease resistance; we can go for higher yields without necessarily having dramatic farming techniques to do it, or costs.
We could conceivably expand the climate window: we could make Pinot Noir grow maybe in Long Island, God forbid.
(Laughter) We could produce better flavors and aromas.
You want a little more raspberry, a little more chocolate here or there?
All of these things could conceivably be done, and I will tell you I'd pretty much bet that it will be done.
But there's an ecosystem here.
In other words, we're not, sort of, unique little organisms running around; we are part of a big ecosystem.
In fact -- I'm sorry to inform you -- that inside of your digestive tract is about 10 pounds of microbes which you're circulating through your body quite a bit.
Our ocean's teaming with microbes; in fact, when Craig Venter went and sequenced the microbes in the ocean, in the first three months tripled the known species on the planet by discovering all-new microbes in the first 20 feet of water.
We now understand that those microbes have more impact on our climate and regulating CO2 and oxygen than plants do, which we always thought oxygenate the atmosphere.
We find microbial life in every part of the planet: in ice, in coal, in rocks, in volcanic vents; it's an amazing thing.
But we've also discovered, when it comes to plants, in plants, as much as we understand and are starting to understand their genomes, it is the ecosystem around them, it is the microbes that live in their root systems, that have just as much impact on the character of those plants as the metabolic pathways of the plants themselves.
If you take a closer look at a root system, you will find there are many, many, many diverse microbial colonies.
This is not big news to viticulturists; they have been, you know, concerned with water and fertilization.
And, again, this is, sort of, my notion of shit-against-the-wall pharmacology: you know certain fertilizers make the plant more healthy so you put more in.
You don't necessarily know with granularity exactly what organisms are providing what flavors and what characteristics.
We can start to figure that out.
We all talk about terroir; we worship terroir; we say, Wow, is my terroir great! It's so special.
I've got this piece of land and it creates terroir like you wouldn't believe.
Well, you know, we really, we argue and debate about it -- we say it's climate, it's soil, it's this. Well, guess what?
We can figure out what the heck terroir is.
It's in there, waiting to be sequenced.
There are thousands of microbes there.
They're easy to sequence: unlike a human, they, you know, have a thousand, two thousand genes; we can figure out what they are.
All we have to do is go around and sample, dig into the ground, find those bugs, sequence them, correlate them to the kinds of characteristics we like and don't like -- that's just a big database -- and then fertilize.
And then we understand what is terroir.
So, some people will say, Oh, my God, are we playing God?
Are we now, if we engineer organisms, are we playing God?
And, you know, people would always ask James Watson -- he's not always the most politically correct guy ...
(Laughter) ... and they would say, "Are, you know, are you playing God?"
And he had the best answer I ever heard to this question: "Well, somebody has to."
(Laughter) I consider myself a very spiritual person, and without, you know, the organized religion part, and I will tell you: I don't believe there's anything unnatural.
I don't believe that chemicals are unnatural.
I told you I'm going to make some of you puke.
It's very simple: we don't invent molecules, compounds.
They're here. They're in the universe.
We reorganize things, we change them around, but we don't make anything unnatural.
Now, we can create bad impacts -- we can poison ourselves; we can poison the Earth -- but that's just a natural outcome of a mistake we made.
So, what's happening today is, Nature is presenting us with a toolbox, and we find that this toolbox is very extensive.
There are microbes out there that actually make gasoline, believe it or not.
There are microbes, you know -- go back to yeast.
These are chemical factories; the most sophisticated chemical factories are provided by Nature, and we now can use those.
There also is a set of rules.
Nature will not allow you to -- we could engineer a grape plant, but guess what.
We can't make the grape plant produce babies.
Nature has put a set of rules out there.
We can work within the rules; we can't break the rules; we're just learning what the rules are.
I just ask the question, if you could cure all disease -- if you could make disease go away, because we understand how it actually works, if we could end hunger by being able to create nutritious, healthy plants that grow in very hard-to-grow environments, if we could create clean and plentiful energy -- we, right in the labs at Synthetic Genomics, have single-celled organisms that are taking carbon dioxide and producing a molecule very similar to gasoline.
So, carbon dioxide -- the stuff we want to get rid of -- not sugar, not anything.
Carbon dioxide, a little bit of sunlight, you end up with a lipid that is highly refined.
We could solve our energy problems; we can reduce CO2,; we could clean up our oceans; we could make better wine.
If we could, would we?
Well, you know, I think the answer is very simple: working with Nature, working with this tool set that we now understand, is the next step in humankind's evolution.
And all I can tell you is, stay healthy for 20 years.
If you can stay healthy for 20 years, you'll see 150, maybe 300.
Thank you.
The contents of this metal cylinder could either revolutionize technology or be completely useless— it all depends on whether we can harness the strange physics of matter at very, very small scales.
To have even a chance of doing so, we have to control the environment precisely: the thick tabletop and legs guard against vibrations from footsteps, nearby elevators, and opening or closing doors.
The cylinder is a vacuum chamber, devoid of all the gases in air.
Inside the vacuum chamber is a smaller, extremely cold compartment, reachable by tiny laser beams.
Inside are ultra-sensitive particles that make up a quantum computer.
So what makes these particles worth the effort?
In theory, quantum computers could outstrip the computational limits of classical computers.
Classical computers process data in the form of bits.
Each bit can switch between two states labeled zero and one.
A quantum computer uses something called a qubit, which can switch between zero, one, and what’s called a superposition.
While the qubit is in its superposition, it has a lot more information than one or zero.
You can think of these positions as points on a sphere: the north and south poles of the sphere represent one and zero.
A bit can only switch between these two poles, but when a qubit is in its superposition, it can be at any point on the sphere.
We can’t locate it exactly— the moment we read it, the qubit resolves into a zero or a one.
But even though we can’t observe the qubit in its superposition, we can manipulate it to perform particular operations while in this state.
So as a problem grows more complicated, a classical computer needs correspondingly more bits to solve it, while a quantum computer will theoretically be able to handle more and more complicated problems without requiring as many more qubits as a classical computer would need bits.
The unique properties of quantum computers result from the behavior of atomic and subatomic particles.
These particles have quantum states, which correspond to the state of the qubit.
Quantum states are incredibly fragile, easily destroyed by temperature and pressure fluctuations, stray electromagnetic fields, and collisions with nearby particles.
That’s why quantum computers need such an elaborate set up.
It’s also why, for now, the power of quantum computers remains largely theoretical.
So far, we can only control a few qubits in the same place at the same time.
There are two key components involved in managing these fickle quantum states effectively: the types of particles a quantum computer uses, and how it manipulates those particles.
For now, there are two leading approaches: trapped ions and superconducting qubits.
A trapped ion quantum computer uses ions as its particles and manipulates them with lasers.
The ions are housed in a trap made of electrical fields.
Inputs from the lasers tell the ions what operation to make by causing the qubit state to rotate on the sphere.
To use a simplified example, the lasers could input the question: what are the prime factors of 15?
In response, the ions may release photons— the state of the qubit determines whether the ion emits photons and how many photons it emits.
An imaging system collects these photons and processes them to reveal the answer: 3 and 5.
Superconducting qubit quantum computers do the same thing in a different way: using a chip with electrical circuits instead of an ion trap.
The states of each electrical circuit translate to the state of the qubit.
They can be manipulated with electrical inputs in the form of microwaves.
So: the qubits come from either ions or electrical circuits, acted on by either lasers or microwaves.
Each approach has advantages and disadvantages.
Ions can be manipulated very precisely, and they last a long time, but as more ions are added to a trap, it becomes increasingly difficult to control each with precision.
We can’t currently contain enough ions in a trap to make advanced computations, but one possible solution might be to connect many smaller traps that communicate with each other via photons rather than trying to create one big trap.
Superconducting circuits, meanwhile, make operations much faster than trapped ions, and it’s easier to scale up the number of circuits in a computer than the number of ions.
But the circuits are also more fragile, and have a shorter overall lifespan.
And as quantum computers advance, they will still be subject to the environmental constraints needed to preserve quantum states.
But in spite of all these obstacles, we’ve already succeeded at making computations in a realm we can’t enter or even observe.
The future that we will create can be a future that we'll be proud of.
I think about this every day; it's quite literally my job.
I'm co-founder and senior columnist at Worldchanging.com.
Alex Steffen and I founded Worldchanging in late 2003, and since then we and our growing global team of contributors have documented the ever-expanding variety of solutions that are out there, right now and on the near horizon.
In a little over two years, we've written up about 4,000 items -- replicable models, technological tools, emerging ideas -- all providing a path to a future that's more sustainable, more equitable and more desirable.
Our emphasis on solutions is quite intentional.
There are tons of places to go, online and off, if what you want to find is the latest bit of news about just how quickly our hell-bound handbasket is moving.
We want to offer people an idea of what they can do about it.
We focus primarily on the planet's environment, but we also address issues of global development, international conflict, responsible use of emerging technologies, even the rise of the so-called Second Superpower and much, much more.
The scope of solutions that we discuss is actually pretty broad, but that reflects both the range of challenges that need to be met and the kinds of innovations that will allow us to do so.
A quick sampling really can barely scratch the surface, but to give you a sense of what we cover: tools for rapid disaster relief, such as this inflatable concrete shelter; innovative uses of bioscience, such as a flower that changes color in the presence of landmines; ultra high-efficiency designs for homes and offices; distributed power generation using solar power, wind power, ocean power, other clean energy sources; ultra, ultra high-efficiency vehicles of the future; ultra high-efficiency vehicles you can get right now; and better urban design, so you don't need to drive as much in the first place; bio-mimetic approaches to design that take advantage of the efficiencies of natural models in both vehicles and buildings; distributed computing projects that will help us model the future of the climate.
Also, a number of the topics that we've been talking about this week at TED are things that we've addressed in the past on Worldchanging: cradle-to-cradle design, MIT's Fab Labs, the consequences of extreme longevity, the One Laptop per Child project, even Gapminder.
As a born-in-the-mid-1960s Gen X-er, hurtling all too quickly to my fortieth birthday, I'm naturally inclined to pessimism. But working at Worldchanging has convinced me, much to my own surprise, that successful responses to the world's problems are nonetheless possible.
Moreover, I've come to realize that focusing only on negative outcomes can really blind you to the very possibility of success.
As Norwegian social scientist Evelin Lindner has observed, "Pessimism is a luxury of good times ...
In difficult times, pessimism is a self-fulfilling, self-inflicted death sentence."
The truth is, we can build a better world, and we can do so right now.
We have the tools: we saw a hint of that a moment ago, and we're coming up with new ones all the time.
We have the knowledge, and our understanding of the planet improves every day.
Most importantly, we have the motive: we have a world that needs fixing, and nobody's going to do it for us.
Many of the solutions that I and my colleagues seek out and write up every day have some important aspects in common: transparency, collaboration, a willingness to experiment, and an appreciation of science -- or, more appropriately, science!
(Laughter) The majority of models, tools and ideas on Worldchanging encompass combinations of these characteristics, so I want to give you a few concrete examples of how these principles combine in world-changing ways.
We can see world-changing values in the emergence of tools to make the invisible visible -- that is, to make apparent the conditions of the world around us that would otherwise be largely imperceptible.
We know that people often change their behavior when they can see and understand the impact of their actions.
As a small example, many of us have experienced the change in driving behavior that comes from having a real time display of mileage showing precisely how one's driving habits affect the vehicle's efficiency.
The last few years have all seen the rise of innovations in how we measure and display aspects of the world that can be too big, or too intangible, or too slippery to grasp easily.
Simple technologies, like wall-mounted devices that display how much power your household is using, and what kind of results you'll get if you turn off a few lights -- these can actually have a direct positive impact on your energy footprint.
Community tools, like text messaging, that can tell you when pollen counts are up or smog levels are rising or a natural disaster is unfolding, can give you the information you need to act in a timely fashion.
Data-rich displays like maps of campaign contributions, or maps of the disappearing polar ice caps, allow us to better understand the context and the flow of processes that affect us all.
We can see world-changing values in research projects that seek to meet the world's medical needs through open access to data and collaborative action.
Now, some people emphasize the risks of knowledge-enabled dangers, but I'm convinced that the benefits of knowledge-enabled solutions are far more important.
For example, open-access journals, like the Public Library of Science, make cutting-edge scientific research free to all -- everyone in the world.
And actually, a growing number of science publishers are adopting this model.
Last year, hundreds of volunteer biology and chemistry researchers around the world worked together to sequence the genome of the parasite responsible for some of the developing world's worst diseases: African sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis and Chagas disease.
That genome data can now be found on open-access genetic data banks around the world, and it's an enormous boon to researchers trying to come up with treatments.
But my favorite example has to be the global response to the SARS epidemic in 2003, 2004, which relied on worldwide access to the full gene sequence of the SARS virus.
The U.S. National Research Council in its follow-up report on the outbreak specifically cited this open availability of the sequence as a key reason why the treatment for SARS could be developed so quickly.
And we can see world-changing values in something as humble as a cell phone.
I can probably count on my fingers the number of people in this room who do not use a mobile phone -- and where is Aubrey, because I know he doesn't?
(Laughter) For many of us, cell phones have really become almost an extension of ourselves, and we're really now beginning to see the social changes that mobile phones can bring about.
You may already know some of the big-picture aspects: globally, more camera phones were sold last year than any other kind of camera, and a growing number of people live lives mediated through the lens, and over the network -- and sometimes enter history books.
In the developing world, mobile phones have become economic drivers.
A study last year showed a direct correlation between the growth of mobile phone use and subsequent GDP increases across Africa.
In Kenya, mobile phone minutes have actually become an alternative currency.
The political aspects of mobile phones can't be ignored either, from text message swarms in Korea helping to bring down a government, to the Blairwatch Project in the UK, keeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press.
(Laughter) And it's just going to get more wild.
Pervasive, always-on networks, high quality sound and video, even devices made to be worn instead of carried in the pocket, will transform how we live on a scale that few really appreciate.
It's no exaggeration to say that the mobile phone may be among the world's most important technologies.
And in this rapidly evolving context, it's possible to imagine a world in which the mobile phone becomes something far more than a medium for social interaction.
I've long admired the Witness project, and Peter Gabriel told us more details about it on Wednesday, in his profoundly moving presentation.
And I'm just incredibly happy to see the news that Witness is going to be opening up a Web portal to enable users of digital cameras and camera phones to send in their recordings over the Internet, rather than just hand-carrying the videotape.
Not only does this add a new and potentially safer avenue for documenting abuses, it opens up the program to the growing global digital generation.
Now, imagine a similar model for networking environmentalists.
Imagine a Web portal collecting recordings and evidence of what's happening to the planet: putting news and data at the fingertips of people of all kinds, from activists and researchers to businesspeople and political figures.
It would highlight the changes that are underway, but would more importantly give voice to the people who are willing to work to see a new world, a better world, come about.
It would give everyday citizens a chance to play a role in the protection of the planet.
It would be, in essence, an "Earth Witness" project.
Now, just to be clear, in this talk I'm using the name "Earth Witness" as part of the scenario, simply as a shorthand, for what this imaginary project could aspire to, not to piggyback on the wonderful work of the Witness organization.
It could just as easily be called, "Environmental Transparency Project," "Smart Mobs for Natural Security" -- but Earth Witness is a lot easier to say.
Now, many of the people who participate in Earth Witness would focus on ecological problems, human-caused or otherwise, especially environmental crimes and significant sources of greenhouse gases and emissions.
That's understandable and important.
We need better documentation of what's happening to the planet if we're ever going to have a chance of repairing the damage.
But the Earth Witness project wouldn't need to be limited to problems.
In the best Worldchanging tradition, it might also serve as a showcase for good ideas, successful projects and efforts to make a difference that deserve much more visibility.
Earth Witness would show us two worlds: the world we're leaving behind, and the world we're building for generations to come.
And what makes this scenario particularly appealing to me is we could do it today.
The key components are already widely available.
Camera phones, of course, would be fundamental to the project.
And for a lot of us, they're as close as we have yet to always-on, widely available information tools.
We may not remember to bring our digital cameras with us wherever we go, but very few of us forget our phones.
You could even imagine a version of this scenario in which people actually build their own phones.
Over the course of last year, open-source hardware hackers have come up with multiple models for usable, Linux-based mobile phones, and the Earth Phone could spin off from this kind of project.
At the other end of the network, there'd be a server for people to send photos and messages to, accessible over the Web, combining a photo-sharing service, social networking platforms and a collaborative filtering system.
Now, you Web 2.0 folks in the audience know what I'm talking about, but for those of you for whom that last sentence was in a crazy moon language, I mean simply this: the online part of the Earth Witness project would be created by the users, working together and working openly.
That's enough right there to start to build a compelling chronicle of what's now happening to our planet, but we could do more.
An Earth Witness site could also serve as a collection spot for all sorts of data about conditions around the planet picked up by environmental sensors that attach to your cell phone.
Now, you don't see these devices as add-ons for phones yet, but students and engineers around the world have attached atmospheric sensors to bicycles and handheld computers and cheap robots and the backs of pigeons -- that being a project that's actually underway right now at U.C. Irvine, using bird-mounted sensors as a way of measuring smog-forming pollution.
It's hardly a stretch to imagine putting the same thing on a phone carried by a person.
Now, the idea of connecting a sensor to your phone is not new: phone-makers around the world offer phones that sniff for bad breath, or tell you to worry about too much sun exposure.
Swedish firm Uppsala Biomedical, more seriously, makes a mobile phone add-on that can process blood tests in the field, uploading the data, displaying the results.
Even the Lawrence Livermore National Labs have gotten into the act, designing a prototype phone that has radiation sensors to find dirty bombs.
Now, there's an enormous variety of tiny, inexpensive sensors on the market, and you can easily imagine someone putting together a phone that could measure temperature, CO2 or methane levels, the presence of some biotoxins -- potentially, in a few years, maybe even H5N1 avian flu virus.
You could see that some kind of system like this would actually be a really good fit with Larry Brilliant's InSTEDD project.
Now, all of this data could be tagged with geographic information and mashed up with online maps for easy viewing and analysis.
And that's worth noting in particular.
The impact of open-access online maps over the last year or two has been simply phenomenal.
Developers around the world have come up with an amazing variety of ways to layer useful data on top of the maps, from bus routes and crime statistics to the global progress of avian flu.
Earth Witness would take this further, linking what you see with what thousands or millions of other people see around the world.
It's kind of exciting to think about what might be accomplished if something like this ever existed.
We'd have a far better -- far better knowledge of what's happening on our planet environmentally than could be gathered with satellites and a handful of government sensor nets alone.
It would be a collaborative, bottom-up approach to environmental awareness and protection, able to respond to emerging concerns in a smart mobs kind of way -- and if you need greater sensor density, just have more people show up.
And most important, you can't ignore how important mobile phones are to global youth.
This is a system that could put the next generation at the front lines of gathering environmental data.
And as we work to figure out ways to mitigate the worst effects of climate disruption, every little bit of information matters.
A system like Earth Witness would be a tool for all of us to participate in the improvement of our knowledge and, ultimately, the improvement of the planet itself.
Now, as I suggested at the outset, there are thousands upon thousands of good ideas out there, so why have I spent the bulk of my time telling you about something that doesn't exist?
Because this is what tomorrow could look like: bottom-up, technology-enabled global collaboration to handle the biggest crisis our civilization has ever faced.
We can save the planet, but we can't do it alone -- we need each other.
Nobody's going to fix the world for us, but working together, making use of technological innovations and human communities alike, we might just be able to fix it ourselves.
We have at our fingertips a cornucopia of compelling models, powerful tools, and innovative ideas that can make a meaningful difference in our planet's future.
We don't need to wait for a magic bullet to save us all; we already have an arsenal of solutions just waiting to be used.
There's a staggering array of wonders out there, across diverse disciplines, all telling us the same thing: success can be ours if we're willing to try.
And as we say at Worldchanging, another world isn't just possible; another world is here.
We just need to open our eyes. Thank you very much.
I want to talk today about -- I've been asked to take the long view, and I'm going to tell you what I think are the three biggest problems for humanity from this long point of view.
Some of these have already been touched upon by other speakers, which is encouraging.
It seems that there's not just one person who thinks that these problems are important.
The first is -- death is a big problem.
If you look at the statistics, the odds are not very favorable to us.
So far, most people who have lived have also died.
Roughly 90 percent of everybody who has been alive has died by now.
So the annual death rate adds up to 150,000 -- sorry, the daily death rate -- 150,000 people per day, which is a huge number by any standard.
The annual death rate, then, becomes 56 million.
If we just look at the single, biggest cause of death -- aging -- it accounts for roughly two-thirds of all human people who die.
That adds up to an annual death toll of greater than the population of Canada.
Sometimes, we don't see a problem because either it's too familiar or it's too big.
Can't see it because it's too big.
I think death might be both too familiar and too big for most people to see it as a problem.
Once you think about it, you see this is not statistical points; these are -- let's see, how far have I talked?
I've talked for three minutes.
So that would be, roughly, 324 people have died since I've begun speaking.
People like -- it's roughly the population in this room has just died.
Now, the human cost of that is obvious, once you start to think about it -- the suffering, the loss -- it's also, economically, enormously wasteful.
I just look at the information, and knowledge, and experience that is lost due to natural causes of death in general, and aging, in particular.
Suppose we approximated one person with one book?
Now, of course, this is an underestimation.
A person's lifetime of learning and experience is a lot more than you could put into a single book.
But let's suppose we did this.
52 million people die of natural causes each year corresponds, then, to 52 million volumes destroyed.
Library of Congress holds 18 million volumes.
We are upset about the burning of the Library of Alexandria.
It's one of the great cultural tragedies that we remember, even today.
But this is the equivalent of three Libraries of Congress -- burnt down, forever lost -- each year.
So that's the first big problem.
And I wish Godspeed to Aubrey de Grey, and other people like him, to try to do something about this as soon as possible.
Existential risk -- the second big problem.
Existential risk is a threat to human survival, or to the long-term potential of our species.
Now, why do I say that this is a big problem?
Well, let's first look at the probability -- and this is very, very difficult to estimate -- but there have been only four studies on this in recent years, which is surprising.
You would think that it would be of some interest to try to find out more about this given that the stakes are so big, but it's a very neglected area.
But there have been four studies -- one by John Lesley, wrote a book on this.
He estimated a probability that we will fail to survive the current century: 50 percent.
Similarly, the Astronomer Royal, whom we heard speak yesterday, also has a 50 percent probability estimate.
Another author doesn't give any numerical estimate, but says the probability is significant that it will fail.
I wrote a long paper on this.
I said assigning a less than 20 percent probability would be a mistake in light of the current evidence we have.
Now, the exact figures here, we should take with a big grain of salt, but there seems to be a consensus that the risk is substantial.
Everybody who has looked at this and studied it agrees.
Now, if we think about what just reducing the probability of human extinction by just one percentage point -- not very much -- so that's equivalent to 60 million lives saved, if we just count the currently living people, the current generation.
Now one percent of six billion people is equivalent to 60 million.
So that's a large number.
If we were to take into account future generations that will never come into existence if we blow ourselves up, then the figure becomes astronomical.
If we could eventually colonize a chunk of the universe -- the Virgo supercluster -- maybe it will take us 100 million years to get there, but if we go extinct we never will.
Then, even a one percentage point reduction in the extinction risk could be equivalent to this astronomical number -- 10 to the power of 32.
So if you take into account future generations as much as our own, every other moral imperative of philanthropic cost just becomes irrelevant.
The only thing you should focus on would be to reduce existential risk because even the tiniest decrease in existential risk would just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope to achieve.
And even if you just look at the current people, and ignore the potential that would be lost if we went extinct, it should still have a high priority.
Now, let me spend the rest of my time on the third big problem, because it's more subtle and perhaps difficult to grasp.
Think about some time in your life -- some people might never have experienced it -- but some people, there are just those moments that you have experienced where life was fantastic.
It might have been at the moment of some great, creative inspiration you might have had when you just entered this flow stage.
Or when you understood something you had never done before.
Or perhaps in the ecstasy of romantic love.
Or an aesthetic experience -- a sunset or a great piece of art.
Every once in a while we have these moments, and we realize just how good life can be when it's at its best.
And you wonder, why can't it be like that all the time?
You just want to cling onto this.
And then, of course, it drifts back into ordinary life and the memory fades.
And it's really difficult to recall, in a normal frame of mind, just how good life can be at its best.
Or how bad it can be at its worst.
The third big problem is that life isn't usually as wonderful as it could be.
I think that's a big, big problem.
It's easy to say what we don't want.
Here are a number of things that we don't want -- illness, involuntary death, unnecessary suffering, cruelty, stunted growth, memory loss, ignorance, absence of creativity.
Suppose we fixed these things -- we did something about all of these.
We were very successful.
We got rid of all of these things.
We might end up with something like this, which is -- I mean, it's a heck of a lot better than that.
But is this really the best we can dream of?
Is this the best we can do?
Or is it possible to find something a little bit more inspiring to work towards?
And if we think about this, I think it's very clear that there are ways in which we could change things, not just by eliminating negatives, but adding positives.
On my wish list, at least, would be: much longer, healthier lives, greater subjective well-being, enhanced cognitive capacities, more knowledge and understanding, unlimited opportunity for personal growth beyond our current biological limits, better relationships, an unbounded potential for spiritual, moral and intellectual development.
If we want to achieve this, what, in the world, would have to change?
And this is the answer -- we would have to change.
Not just the world around us, but we, ourselves.
Not just the way we think about the world, but the way we are -- our very biology.
Human nature would have to change.
Now, when we think about changing human nature, the first thing that comes to mind are these human modification technologies -- growth hormone therapy, cosmetic surgery, stimulants like Ritalin, Adderall, anti-depressants, anabolic steroids, artificial hearts.
It's a pretty pathetic list.
They do great things for a few people who suffer from some specific condition, but for most people, they don't really transform what it is to be human.
And they also all seem a little bit -- most people have this instinct that, well, sure, there needs to be anti-depressants for the really depressed people.
But there's a kind of queasiness that these are unnatural in some way.
It's worth recalling that there are a lot of other modification technologies and enhancement technologies that we use.
We have skin enhancements, clothing.
As far as I can see, all of you are users of this enhancement technology in this room, so that's a great thing.
Mood modifiers have been used from time immemorial -- caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, immune system enhancement, vision enhancement, anesthetics -- we take that very much for granted, but just think about how great progress that is -- like, having an operation before anesthetics was not fun.
Contraceptives, cosmetics and brain reprogramming techniques -- that sounds ominous, but the distinction between what is a technology -- a gadget would be the archetype -- and other ways of changing and rewriting human nature is quite subtle.
So if you think about what it means to learn arithmetic or to learn to read, you're actually, literally rewriting your own brain.
You're changing the microstructure of your brain as you go along.
So in a broad sense, we don't need to think about technology as only little gadgets, like these things here, but even institutions and techniques, psychological methods and so forth.
Forms of organization can have a profound impact on human nature.
Looking ahead, there is a range of technologies that are almost certain to be developed sooner or later.
We are very ignorant about what the time scale for these things are, but they all are consistent with everything we know about physical laws, laws of chemistry, etc.
It's possible to assume, setting aside a possibility of catastrophe, that sooner or later we will develop all of these.
And even just a couple of these would be enough to transform the human condition.
So let's look at some of the dimensions of human nature that seem to leave room for improvement.
Health span is a big and urgent thing, because if you're not alive, then all the other things will be to little avail.
Intellectual capacity -- let's take that box, which falls into a lot of different sub-categories: memory, concentration, mental energy, intelligence, empathy.
These are really great things.
Part of the reason why we value these traits is that they make us better at competing with other people -- they're positional goods.
But part of the reason -- and that's the reason why we have ethical ground for pursuing these -- is that they're also intrinsically valuable.
It's just better to be able to understand more of the world around you and the people that you are communicating with, and to remember what you have learned.
Modalities and special faculties.
Now, the human mind is not a single unitary information processor, but it has a lot of different, special, evolved modules that do specific things for us.
If you think about what we normally take as giving life a lot of its meaning -- music, humor, eroticism, spirituality, aesthetics, nurturing and caring, gossip, chatting with people -- all of these, very likely, are enabled by a special circuitry that we humans have, but that you could have another intelligent life form that lacks these.
We're just lucky that we have the requisite neural machinery to process music and to appreciate it and enjoy it.
All of these would enable, in principle -- be amenable to enhancement.
Some people have a better musical ability and ability to appreciate music than others have.
It's also interesting to think about what other things are -- so if these all enabled great values, why should we think that evolution has happened to provide us with all the modalities we would need to engage with other values that there might be?
Imagine a species that just didn't have this neural machinery for processing music.
And they would just stare at us with bafflement when we spend time listening to a beautiful performance, like the one we just heard -- because of people making stupid movements, and they would be really irritated and wouldn't see what we were up to.
But maybe they have another faculty, something else that would seem equally irrational to us, but they actually tap into some great possible value there.
But we are just literally deaf to that kind of value.
So we could think of adding on different, new sensory capacities and mental faculties.
Bodily functionality and morphology and affective self-control.
Greater subjective well-being.
Be able to switch between relaxation and activity -- being able to go slow when you need to do that, and to speed up.
Able to switch back and forth more easily would be a neat thing to be able to do -- easier to achieve the flow state, when you're totally immersed in something you are doing.
Conscientiousness and sympathy.
The ability to -- it's another interesting application that would have large social ramification, perhaps.
If you could actually choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person, undiminished through time, so that wouldn't have to -- love would never have to fade if you didn't want it to.
That's probably not all that difficult.
It might just be a simple hormone or something that could do this.
It's been done in voles.
You can engineer a prairie vole to become monogamous when it's naturally polygamous.
It's just a single gene.
Might be more complicated in humans, but perhaps not that much.
This is the last picture that I want to -- now we've got to use the laser pointer.
A possible mode of being here would be a way of life -- a way of being, experiencing, thinking, seeing, interacting with the world.
Down here in this little corner, here, we have the little sub-space of this larger space that is accessible to human beings -- beings with our biological capacities.
It's a part of the space that's accessible to animals; since we are animals, we are a subset of that.
And then you can imagine some enhancements of human capacities.
There would be different modes of being you could experience if you were able to stay alive for, say, 200 years.
Then you could live sorts of lives and accumulate wisdoms that are just not possible for humans as we currently are.
So then, you move off to this larger sphere of "human +," and you could continue that process and eventually explore a lot of this larger space of possible modes of being.
Now, why is that a good thing to do?
Well, we know already that in this little human circle there, there are these enormously wonderful and worthwhile modes of being -- human life at its best is wonderful.
We have no reason to believe that within this much, much larger space there would not also be extremely worthwhile modes of being, perhaps ones that would be way beyond our wildest ability even to imagine or dream about.
And so, to fix this third problem, I think we need -- slowly, carefully, with ethical wisdom and constraint -- develop the means that enable us to go out in this larger space and explore it and find the great values that might hide there.
Thanks.
So, I want to start out with this beautiful picture from my childhood.
I love the science fiction movies.
Here it is: "This Island Earth."
And leave it to Hollywood to get it just right.
Two-and-a-half years in the making.
(Laughter) I mean, even the creationists give us 6,000, but Hollywood goes to the chase.
And in this movie, we see what we think is out there: flying saucers and aliens.
Every world has an alien, and every alien world has a flying saucer, and they move about with great speed. Aliens.
Well, Don Brownlee, my friend, and I finally got to the point where we got tired of turning on the TV and seeing the spaceships and seeing the aliens every night, and tried to write a counter-argument to it, and put out what does it really take for an Earth to be habitable, for a planet to be an Earth, to have a place where you could probably get not just life, but complexity, which requires a huge amount of evolution, and therefore constancy of conditions.
So, in 2000 we wrote "Rare Earth." In 2003, we then asked, let's not think about where Earths are in space, but how long has Earth been Earth?
If you go back two billion years, you're not on an Earth-like planet any more.
What we call an Earth-like planet is actually a very short interval of time.
Well, "Rare Earth" actually taught me an awful lot about meeting the public.
Right after, I got an invitation to go to a science fiction convention, and with all great earnestness walked in.
David Brin was going to debate me on this, and as I walked in, the crowd of a hundred started booing lustily.
I had a girl who came up who said, "My dad says you're the devil."
You cannot take people's aliens away from them and expect to be anybody's friends.
Well, the second part of that, soon after -- and I was talking to Paul Allen; I saw him in the audience, and I handed him a copy of "Rare Earth."
And Jill Tarter was there, and she turned to me, and she looked at me just like that girl in "The Exorcist."
It was, "It burns! It burns!"
Because SETI doesn't want to hear this.
SETI wants there to be stuff out there.
I really applaud the SETI efforts, but we have not heard anything yet.
And I really do think we have to start thinking about what's a good planet and what isn't.
Now, I throw this slide up because it indicates to me that, even if SETI does hear something, can we figure out what they said?
Because this was a slide that was passed between the two major intelligences on Earth -- a Mac to a PC -- and it can't even get the letters right -- (Laughter) -- so how are we going to talk to the aliens?
And if they're 50 light years away, and we call them up, and you blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and then 50 years later it comes back and they say, Please repeat?
I mean, there we are.
Our planet is a good planet because it can keep water.
Mars is a bad planet, but it's still good enough for us to go there and to live on its surface if we're protected.
But Venus is a very bad -- the worst -- planet.
Even though it's Earth-like, and even though early in its history it may very well have harbored Earth-like life, it soon succumbed to runaway greenhouse -- that's an 800 degrees [Fahrenheit] surface -- because of rampant carbon dioxide.
Well, we know from astrobiology that we can really now predict what's going to happen to our particular planet.
We are right now in the beautiful Oreo of existence -- of at least life on Planet Earth -- following the first horrible microbial age.
In the Cambrian explosion, life emerged from the swamps, complexity arose, and from what we can tell, we're halfway through.
We have as much time for animals to exist on this planet as they have been here now, till we hit the second microbial age.
And that will happen, paradoxically -- everything you hear about global warming -- when we hit CO2 down to 10 parts per million, we are no longer going to have to have plants that are allowed to have any photosynthesis, and there go animals.
So, after that we probably have seven billion years.
The Sun increases in its intensity, in its brightness, and finally, at about 12 billion years after it first started, the Earth is consumed by a large Sun, and this is what's left.
So, a planet like us is going to have an age and an old age, and we are in its golden summer age right now.
But there's two fates to everything, isn't there?
Now, a lot of you are going to die of old age, but some of you, horribly enough, are going to die in an accident.
And that's the fate of a planet, too.
Earth, if we're lucky enough -- if it doesn't get hit by a Hale-Bopp, or gets blasted by some supernova nearby in the next seven billion years -- we'll find under your feet.
But what about accidental death?
Well, paleontologists for the last 200 years have been charting death. It's strange -- extinction as a concept wasn't even thought about until Baron Cuvier in France found this first mastodon.
He couldn't match it up to any bones on the planet, and he said, Aha! It's extinct.
And very soon after, the fossil record started yielding a very good idea of how many plants and animals there have been since complex life really began to leave a very interesting fossil record.
In that complex record of fossils, there were times when lots of stuff seemed to be dying out very quickly, and the father/mother geologists called these "mass extinctions."
All along it was thought to be either an act of God or perhaps long, slow climate change, and that really changed in 1980, in this rocky outcrop near Gubbio, where Walter Alvarez, trying to figure out what was the time difference between these white rocks, which held creatures of the Cretaceous period, and the pink rocks above, which held Tertiary fossils.
How long did it take to go from one system to the next?
And what they found was something unexpected.
They found in this gap, in between, a very thin clay layer, and that clay layer -- this very thin red layer here -- is filled with iridium.
And not just iridium; it's filled with glassy spherules, and it's filled with quartz grains that have been subjected to enormous pressure: shock quartz.
Now, in this slide the white is chalk, and this chalk was deposited in a warm ocean.
The chalk itself's composed by plankton which has fallen down from the sea surface onto the sea floor, so that 90 percent of the sediment here is skeleton of living stuff, and then you have that millimeter-thick red layer, and then you have black rock.
And the black rock is the sediment on the sea bottom in the absence of plankton.
And that's what happens in an asteroid catastrophe, because that's what this was, of course. This is the famous K-T.
A 10-kilometer body hit the planet.
The effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet, and we had very quickly the death of the dinosaurs, the death of these beautiful ammonites, Leconteiceras here, and Celaeceras over here, and so much else.
I mean, it must be true, because we've had two Hollywood blockbusters since that time, and this paradigm, from 1980 to about 2000, totally changed how we geologists thought about catastrophes.
Prior to that, uniformitarianism was the dominant paradigm: the fact that if anything happens on the planet in the past, there are present-day processes that will explain it.
But we haven't witnessed a big asteroid impact, so this is a type of neo-catastrophism, and it took about 20 years for the scientific establishment to finally come to grips: yes, we were hit; and yes, the effects of that hit caused a major mass extinction.
Well, there are five major mass extinctions over the last 500 million years, called the Big Five.
They range from 450 million years ago to the last, the K-T, number four, but the biggest of all was the P, or the Permian extinction, sometimes called the mother of all mass extinctions.
And every one of these has been subsequently blamed on large-body impact.
But is this true?
The most recent, the Permian, was thought to have been an impact because of this beautiful structure on the right.
This is a Buckminsterfullerene, a carbon-60.
Because it looks like those terrible geodesic domes of my late beloved '60s, they're called "buckyballs."
This evidence was used to suggest that at the end of the Permian, 250 million years ago, a comet hit us.
And when the comet hits, the pressure produces the buckyballs, and it captures bits of the comet.
Helium-3: very rare on the surface of the Earth, very common in space.
But is this true?
In 1990, working on the K-T extinction for 10 years, I moved to South Africa to begin work twice a year in the great Karoo desert.
I was so lucky to watch the change of that South Africa into the new South Africa as I went year by year.
And I worked on this Permian extinction, camping by this Boer graveyard for months at a time.
And the fossils are extraordinary.
You know, you're gazing upon your very distant ancestors.
These are mammal-like reptiles.
They are culturally invisible. We do not make movies about these.
This is a Gorgonopsian, or a Gorgon.
That's an 18-inch long skull of an animal that was probably seven or eight feet, sprawled like a lizard, probably had a head like a lion.
This is the top carnivore, the T-Rex of its time.
But there's lots of stuff.
This is my poor son, Patrick.
(Laughter) This is called paleontological child abuse.
Hold still, you're the scale.
(Laughter) There was big stuff back then.
Fifty-five species of mammal-like reptiles.
The age of mammals had well and truly started 250 million years ago ...
... and then a catastrophe happened.
And what happens next is the age of dinosaurs.
It was all a mistake; it should have never happened. But it did.
Now, luckily, this Thrinaxodon, the size of a robin egg here: this is a skull I've discovered just before taking this picture -- there's a pen for scale; it's really tiny -- this is in the Lower Triassic, after the mass extinction has finished.
You can see the eye socket and you can see the little teeth in the front.
If that does not survive, I'm not the thing giving this talk.
Something else is, because if that doesn't survive, we are not here; there are no mammals. It's that close; one species ekes through.
Well, can we say anything about the pattern of who survives and who doesn't?
Here's sort of the end of that 10 years of work.
The ranges of stuff -- the red line is the mass extinction.
But we've got survivors and things that get through, and it turns out the things that get through preferentially are cold bloods.
Warm-blooded animals take a huge hit at this time.
The survivors that do get through produce this world of crocodile-like creatures.
There's no dinosaurs yet; just this slow, saurian, scaly, nasty, swampy place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes.
And there they would hide for 160 million years, until liberated by that K-T asteroid.
So, if not impact, what?
And the what, I think, is that we returned, over and over again, to the Pre-Cambrian world, that first microbial age, and the microbes are still out there.
They hate we animals.
They really want their world back.
And they've tried over and over and over again.
This suggests to me that life causing these mass extinctions because it did is inherently anti-Gaian.
This whole Gaia idea, that life makes the world better for itself -- anybody been on a freeway on a Friday afternoon in Los Angeles believing in the Gaia theory? No.
So, I really suspect there's an alternative, and that life does actually try to do itself in -- not consciously, but just because it does.
And here's the weapon, it seems, that it did so over the last 500 million years.
There are microbes which, through their metabolism, produce hydrogen sulfide, and they do so in large amounts.
Hydrogen sulfide is very fatal to we humans.
As small as 200 parts per million will kill you.
You only have to go to the Black Sea and a few other places -- some lakes -- and get down, and you'll find that the water itself turns purple.
It turns purple from the presence of numerous microbes which have to have sunlight and have to have hydrogen sulfide, and we can detect their presence today -- we can see them -- but we can also detect their presence in the past.
And the last three years have seen an enormous breakthrough in a brand-new field.
I am almost extinct -- I'm a paleontologist who collects fossils.
But the new wave of paleontologists -- my graduate students -- collect biomarkers.
They take the sediment itself, they extract the oil from it, and from that they can produce compounds which turn out to be very specific to particular microbial groups.
It's because lipids are so tough, they can get preserved in sediment and last the hundreds of millions of years necessary, and be extracted and tell us who was there.
And we know who was there. At the end of the Permian, at many of these mass extinction boundaries, this is what we find: isorenieratene. It's very specific.
It can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen, and is totally saturated with hydrogen sulfide -- enough, for instance, to come out of solution.
This led Lee Kump, and others from Penn State and my group, to propose what I call the Kump Hypothesis: many of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen, by high CO2. And the worst effect of global warming, it turns out: hydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans.
Well, what's the source of this?
In this particular case, the source over and over has been flood basalts.
This is a view of the Earth now, if we extract a lot of it.
And each of these looks like a hydrogen bomb; actually, the effects are even worse.
This is when deep-Earth material comes to the surface, spreads out over the surface of the planet.
Well, it's not the lava that kills anything, it's the carbon dioxide that comes out with it.
This isn't Volvos; this is volcanoes.
But carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide.
So, these are new data Rob Berner and I -- from Yale -- put together, and what we try to do now is track the amount of carbon dioxide in the entire rock record -- and we can do this from a variety of means -- and put all the red lines here, when these -- what I call greenhouse mass extinctions -- took place.
And there's two things that are really evident here to me, is that these extinctions take place when CO2 is going up.
But the second thing that's not shown on here: the Earth has never had any ice on it when we've had 1,000 parts per million CO2.
We are at 380 and climbing.
We should be up to a thousand in three centuries at the most, but my friend David Battisti in Seattle says he thinks a 100 years.
So, there goes the ice caps, and there comes 240 feet of sea level rise.
I live in a view house now; I'm going to have waterfront.
All right, what's the consequence? The oceans probably turn purple.
And we think this is the reason that complexity took so long to take place on planet Earth.
We had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period.
They stop complex life from existing.
We know hydrogen sulfide is erupting presently a few places on the planet.
And I throw this slide in -- this is me, actually, two months ago -- and I throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal, chambered nautilus.
It's been on this planet since the animals first started -- 500 million years.
This is a tracking experiment, and any of you scuba divers, if you want to get involved in one of the coolest projects ever, this is off the Great Barrier Reef.
And as we speak now, these nautilus are tracking out their behaviors to us.
But the thing about this is that every once in a while we divers can run into trouble, so I'm going to do a little thought experiment here.
This is a Great White Shark that ate some of my traps.
We pulled it up; up it comes. So, it's out there with me at night.
So, I'm swimming along, and it takes off my leg.
I'm 80 miles from shore, what's going to happen to me?
Well now, I die.
Five years from now, this is what I hope happens to me: I'm taken back to the boat, I'm given a gas mask: 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide.
I'm then thrown in an ice pond, I'm cooled 15 degrees lower and I could be taken to a critical care hospital.
And the reason I could do that is because we mammals have gone through a series of these hydrogen sulfide events, and our bodies have adapted.
And we can now use this as what I think will be a major medical breakthrough.
This is Mark Roth. He was funded by DARPA.
Tried to figure out how to save Americans after battlefield injuries.
He bleeds out pigs.
He puts in 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide -- the same stuff that survived these past mass extinctions -- and he turns a mammal into a reptile.
"I believe we are seeing in this response the result of mammals and reptiles having undergone a series of exposures to H2S."
I got this email from him two years ago; he said, "I think I've got an answer to some of your questions."
So, he now has taken mice down for as many as four hours, sometimes six hours, and these are brand-new data he sent me on the way over here.
On the top, now, that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through -- the dotted line, the temperatures.
So, the temperature starts at 25 centigrade, and down it goes, down it goes.
Six hours later, up goes the temperature.
Now, the same mouse is given 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide in this solid graph, and look what happens to its temperature.
Its temperature drops.
It goes down to 15 degrees centigrade from 35, and comes out of this perfectly fine.
Here is a way we can get people to critical care.
Here's how we can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care.
Now, you're all thinking, yeah, what about the brain tissue?
And so this is one of the great challenges that is going to happen.
You're in an accident. You've got two choices: you're going to die, or you're going to take the hydrogen sulfide and, say, 75 percent of you is saved, mentally.
What are you going to do?
Do we all have to have a little button saying, Let me die?
This is coming towards us, and I think this is going to be a revolution.
We're going to save lives, but there's going to be a cost to it.
The new view of mass extinctions is, yes, we were hit, and, yes, we have to think about the long term, because we will get hit again.
But there's a far worse danger confronting us.
We can easily go back to the hydrogen sulfide world.
Give us a few millennia -- and we humans should last those few millennia -- will it happen again? If we continue, it'll happen again.
How many of us flew here?
How many of us have gone through our entire Kyoto quota just for flying this year?
How many of you have exceeded it? Yeah, I've certainly exceeded it.
We have a huge problem facing us as a species.
We have to beat this.
I want to be able to go back to this reef. Thank you.
(Applause) Chris Anderson: I've just got one question for you, Peter.
Am I understanding you right, that what you're saying here is that we have in our own bodies a biochemical response to hydrogen sulfide that in your mind proves that there have been past mass extinctions due to climate change?
Peter Ward: Yeah, every single cell in us can produce minute quantities of hydrogen sulfide in great crises.
This is what Roth has found out.
So, what we're looking at now: does it leave a signal?
Does it leave a signal in bone or in plant?
And we go back to the fossil record and we could try to detect how many of these have happened in the past.
CA: It's simultaneously an incredible medical technique, but also a terrifying ...
PW: Blessing and curse.
It was the spring of 2011, and as they like to say in commencement speeches, I was getting ready to enter the real world.
I had recently graduated from college and moved to Paris to start my first job.
My dream was to become a war correspondent, but the real world that I found took me into a really different kind of conflict zone.
At 22 years old, I was diagnosed with leukemia.
The doctors told me and my parents, point-blank, that I had about a 35 percent chance of long-term survival.
I couldn't wrap my head around what that prognosis meant.
But I understood that the reality and the life I'd imagined for myself had shattered.
Overnight, I lost my job, my apartment, my independence, and I became patient number 5624.
Over the next four years of chemo, a clinical trial and a bone marrow transplant, the hospital became my home, my bed, the place I lived 24/7.
Since it was unlikely that I'd ever get better, I had to accept my new reality.
And I adapted.
I became fluent in medicalese, made friends with a group of other young cancer patients, built a vast collection of neon wigs and learned to use my rolling IV pole as a skateboard.
I even achieved my dream of becoming a war correspondent, although not in the way I'd expected.
It started with a blog, reporting from the front lines of my hospital bed, and it morphed into a column I wrote for the New York Times, called "Life, Interrupted."
But -- (Applause) Thank you.
(Applause) But above all else, my focus was on surviving.
And -- spoiler alert -- (Laughter) I did survive, yeah.
(Applause) Thanks to an army of supportive humans, I'm not just still here, I am cured of my cancer.
(Applause) Thank you.
(Applause) So, when you go through a traumatic experience like this, people treat you differently.
They start telling you how much of an inspiration you are.
They say you're a warrior.
They call you a hero, someone who's lived the mythical hero's journey, who's endured impossible trials and, against the odds, lived to tell the tale, returning better and braver for what you're been through.
And this definitely lines up with my experience.
Cancer totally transformed my life.
I left the hospital knowing exactly who I was and what I wanted to do in the world.
And now, every day as the sun rises, I drink a big glass of celery juice, and I follow this up with 90 minutes of yoga.
Then, I write down 50 things I'm grateful for onto a scroll of paper that I fold into an origami crane and send sailing out my window.
(Laughter) Are you seriously believing any of this?
(Laughter) I don't do any of these things.
(Laughter) I hate yoga, and I have no idea how to fold an origami crane.
The truth is that for me, the hardest part of my cancer experience began once the cancer was gone.
That heroic journey of the survivor we see in movies and watch play out on Instagram -- it's a myth.
It isn't just untrue, it's dangerous, because it erases the very real challenges of recovery.
Now, don't get me wrong -- I am incredibly grateful to be alive, and I am painfully aware that this struggle is a privilege that many don't get to experience.
But it's important that I tell you what this projection of heroism and expectation of constant gratitude does to people who are trying to recover.
Because being cured is not where the work of healing ends.
It's where it begins.
I'll never forget the day I was discharged from the hospital, finally done with treatment.
Those four years of chemo had taken a toll on my relationship with my longtime boyfriend, and he'd recently moved out.
And when I walked into my apartment, it was quiet.
Eerily so.
The person I wanted to call in this moment, the person who I knew would understand everything, was my friend Melissa.
She was a fellow cancer patient, but she had died three weeks earlier.
As I stood there in the doorway of my apartment, I wanted to cry.
But I was too tired to cry.
The adrenaline was gone.
I had felt as if the inner scaffolding that had held me together since my diagnosis had suddenly crumbled.
I had spent the past 1,500 days working tirelessly to achieve one goal: to survive.
And now that I'd done so, I realized I had absolutely no idea how to live.
On paper, of course, I was better: I didn't have leukemia, my blood counts were back to normal, and the disability checks soon stopped coming.
To the outside world, I clearly didn't belong in the kingdom of the sick anymore.
But in reality, I never felt further from being well.
All that chemo had taken a permanent physical toll on my body.
I wondered, "What kind of job can I hold when I need to nap for four hours in the middle of the day?
When my misfiring immune system still sends me to the ER on a regular basis?"
And then there were the invisible, psychological imprints my illness had left behind: the fears of relapse, the unprocessed grief, the demons of PTSD that descended upon me for days, sometimes weeks.
See, we talk about reentry in the context of war and incarceration.
But we don't talk about it as much in the context of other kinds of traumatic experiences, like an illness.
Because no one had warned me of the challenges of reentry, I thought something must be wrong with me.
I felt ashamed, and with great guilt, I kept reminding myself of how lucky I was to be alive at all, when so many people like my friend Melissa were not.
But on most days, I woke up feeling so sad and lost, I could barely breathe.
Sometimes, I even fantasized about getting sick again.
And let me tell you, there are so many better things to fantasize about when you're in your twenties and recently single.
(Laughter) But I missed the hospital's ecosystem.
Like me, everyone in there was broken.
But out here, among the living, I felt like an impostor, overwhelmed and unable to function.
I also missed the sense of clarity I'd felt at my sickest.
Staring your mortality straight in the eye has a way of simplifying things, of rerouting your focus to what really matters.
And when I was sick, I vowed that if I survived, it had to be for something.
It had to be to live a good life, an adventurous life, a meaningful one.
But the question, once I was cured, became: How?
I was 27 years old with no job, no partner, no structure.
And this time, I didn't have treatment protocols or discharge instructions to help guide my way forward.
But what I did have was an in-box full of internet messages from strangers.
Over the years, people from all over the world had read my column, and they'd responded with letters, comments and emails.
It was a mix, as is often the case, for writers.
I got a lot of unsolicited advice about how to cure my cancer with things like essential oils.
I got some questions about my bra size.
But mostly -- (Laughter) mostly, I heard from people who, in their own different way, understood what it was that I was going through.
I heard from a teenage girl in Florida who, like me, was coming out of chemo and wrote me a message composed largely of emojis.
I heard from a retired art history professor in Ohio named Howard, who'd spent most of his life struggling with a mysterious, debilitating health condition that he'd had from the time he was a young man.
I heard from an inmate on death row in Texas by the name of Little GQ -- short for "Gangster Quinn."
He'd never been sick a day in his life.
He does 1,000 push-ups to start off each morning.
But he related to what I described in one column as my "incanceration," and to the experience of being confined to a tiny fluorescent room.
"I know that our situations are different," he wrote to me, "But the threat of death lurks in both of our shadows."
In those lonely first weeks and months of my recovery, these strangers and their words became lifelines, dispatches from people of so many different backgrounds, with so many different experiences, all showing me the same thing: you can be held hostage by the worst thing that's ever happened to you and allow it to hijack your remaining days, or you can find a way forward.
I knew I needed to make some kind of change.
I wanted to be in motion again to figure out how to unstuck myself and to get back out into the world.
And so I decided to go on a real journey -- not the bullshit cancer one or the mythical hero's journey that everyone thought I should be on, but a real, pack-your-bags kind of journey.
I put everything I owned into storage, rented out my apartment, borrowed a car and talked a very a dear but somewhat smelly friend into joining me.
(Laughter) Together, my dog Oscar and I embarked on a 15,000-mile road trip around the United States.
Along the way, we visited some of those strangers who'd written to me.
I needed their advice, also to say to them, thank you.
I went to Ohio and stayed with Howard, the retired professor.
When you've suffered a loss or a trauma, the impulse can be to guard your heart.
But Howard urged me to open myself up to uncertainty, to the possibilities of new love, new loss.
Howard will never be cured of illness.
And as a young man, he had no way of predicting how long he'd live.
But that didn't stop him from getting married.
Howard has grandkids now, and takes weekly ballroom dancing lessons with his wife.
When I visited them, they’d recently celebrated their 50th anniversary.
In his letter to me, he'd written, "Meaning is not found in the material realm; it's not in dinner, jazz, cocktails or conversation.
Meaning is what's left when everything else is stripped away."
I went to Texas, and I visited Little GQ on death row.
He asked me what I did to pass all that time I'd spent in a hospital room.
When I told him that I got really, really good at Scrabble, he said, "Me, too!" and explained how, even though he spends most of his days in solitary confinement, he and his neighboring prisoners make board games out of paper and call out their plays through their meal slots -- a testament to the incredible tenacity of the human spirit and our ability to adapt with creativity.
And my last stop was in Florida, to see that teenage girl who'd sent me all those emojis.
Her name is Unique, which is perfect, because she's the most luminous, curious person I've ever met.
I asked her what she wants to do next and she said, "I want to go to college and travel and eat weird foods like octopus that I've never tasted before and come visit you in New York and go camping, but I'm scared of bugs, but I still want to go camping."
I was in awe of her, that she could be so optimistic and so full of plans for the future, given everything she'd been through.
But as Unique showed me, it is far more radical and dangerous to have hope than to live hemmed in by fear.
But the most important thing I learned on that road trip is that the divide between the sick and the well -- it doesn't exist.
The border is porous.
As we live longer and longer, surviving illnesses and injuries that would have killed our grandparents, even our parents, the vast majority of us will travel back and forth between these realms, spending much of our lives somewhere between the two.
These are the terms of our existence.
Now, I wish I could say that since coming home from my road trip, I feel fully healed.
I don't.
But once I stopped expecting myself to return to the person I'd been pre-diagnosis, once I learned to accept my body and its limitations, I actually did start to feel better.
And in the end, I think that's the trick: to stop seeing our health as binary, between sick and healthy, well and unwell, whole and broken; to stop thinking that there's some beautiful, perfect state of wellness to strive for; and to quit living in a state of constant dissatisfaction until we reach it.
Every single one of us will have our life interrupted, whether it's by the rip cord of a diagnosis or some other kind of heartbreak or trauma that brings us to the floor.
We need to find ways to live in the in-between place, managing whatever body and mind we currently have.
Sometimes, all it takes is the ingenuity of a handmade game of Scrabble or finding that stripped-down kind of meaning in the love of family and a night on the ballroom dance floor, or that radical, dangerous hope that I'm guessing will someday lead a teenage girl terrified of bugs to go camping.
If you're able to do that, then you've taken the real hero's journey.
You've achieved what it means to actually be well, which is to say: alive, in the messiest, richest, most whole sense.
Thank you, that's all I've got.
(Applause) Thank you.
(Applause)
You know, I am so bad at tech that my daughter -- who is now 41 -- when she was five, was overheard by me to say to a friend of hers, If it doesn't bleed when you cut it, my daddy doesn't understand it.
(Laughter) So, the assignment I've been given may be an insuperable obstacle for me, but I'm certainly going to try.
What have I heard during these last four days?
This is my third visit to TED.
One was to TEDMED, and one, as you've heard, was a regular TED two years ago.
I've heard what I consider an extraordinary thing that I've only heard a little bit in the two previous TEDs, and what that is is an interweaving and an interlarding, an intermixing, of a sense of social responsibility in so many of the talks -- global responsibility, in fact, appealing to enlightened self-interest, but it goes far beyond enlightened self-interest.
One of the most impressive things about what some, perhaps 10, of the speakers have been talking about is the realization, as you listen to them carefully, that they're not saying: Well, this is what we should do; this is what I would like you to do.
It's: This is what I have done because I'm excited by it, because it's a wonderful thing, and it's done something for me and, of course, it's accomplished a great deal.
It's the old concept, the real Greek concept, of philanthropy in its original sense: phil-anthropy, the love of humankind.
And the only explanation I can have for some of what you've been hearing in the last four days is that it arises, in fact, out of a form of love.
And this gives me enormous hope.
And hope, of course, is the topic that I'm supposed to be speaking about, which I'd completely forgotten about until I arrived.
And when I did, I thought, well, I'd better look this word up in the dictionary.
So, Sarah and I -- my wife -- walked over to the public library, which is four blocks away, on Pacific Street, and we got the OED, and we looked in there, and there are 14 definitions of hope, none of which really hits you between the eyes as being the appropriate one.
And, of course, that makes sense, because hope is an abstract phenomenon; it's an abstract idea, it's not a concrete word.
Well, it reminds me a little bit of surgery.
If there's one operation for a disease, you know it works.
If there are 15 operations, you know that none of them work.
And that's the way it is with definitions of words.
If you have appendicitis, they take your appendix out, and you're cured.
If you've got reflux oesophagitis, there are 15 procedures, and Joe Schmo does it one way and Will Blow does it another way, and none of them work, and that's the way it is with this word, hope.
They all come down to the idea of an expectation of something good that is due to happen.
And you know what I found out?
The Indo-European root of the word hope is a stem, K-E-U -- we would spell it K-E-U; it's pronounced koy -- and it is the same root from which the word curve comes from.
But what it means in the original Indo-European is a change in direction, going in a different way.
And I find that very interesting and very provocative, because what you've been hearing in the last couple of days is the sense of going in different directions: directions that are specific and unique to problems.
There are different paradigms.
You've heard that word several times in the last four days, and everyone's familiar with Kuhnian paradigms.
So, when we think of hope now, we have to think of looking in other directions than we have been looking.
There's another -- not definition, but description, of hope that has always appealed to me, and it was one by Václav Havel in his perfectly spectacular book "Breaking the Peace," in which he says that hope does not consist of the expectation that things will come out exactly right, but the expectation that they will make sense regardless of how they come out.
I can't tell you how reassured I was by the very last sentence in that glorious presentation by Dean Kamen a few days ago.
I wasn't sure I heard it right, so I found him in one of the inter-sessions.
He was talking to a very large man, but I didn't care.
I interrupted, and I said, "Did you say this?"
He said, "I think so."
So, here's what it is: I'll repeat it.
"The world will not be saved by the Internet."
It's wonderful. Do you know what the world will be saved by?
I'll tell you. It'll be saved by the human spirit.
And by the human spirit, I don't mean anything divine, I don't mean anything supernatural -- certainly not coming from this skeptic.
What I mean is this ability that each of us has to be something greater than herself or himself; to arise out of our ordinary selves and achieve something that at the beginning we thought perhaps we were not capable of.
On an elemental level, we have all felt that spirituality at the time of childbirth.
Some of you have felt it in laboratories; some of you have felt it at the workbench.
We feel it at concerts.
I've felt it in the operating room, at the bedside.
It is an elevation of us beyond ourselves.
And I think that it's going to be, in time, the elements of the human spirit that we've been hearing about bit by bit by bit from so many of the speakers in the last few days.
And if there's anything that has permeated this room, it is precisely that.
I'm intrigued by a concept that was brought to life in the early part of the 19th century -- actually, in the second decade of the 19th century -- by a 27-year-old poet whose name was Percy Shelley.
Now, we all think that Shelley obviously is the great romantic poet that he was; many of us tend to forget that he wrote some perfectly wonderful essays, too, and the most well-remembered essay is one called "A Defence of Poetry."
Now, it's about five, six, seven, eight pages long, and it gets kind of deep and difficult after about the third page, but somewhere on the second page he begins talking about the notion that he calls "moral imagination."
And here's what he says, roughly translated: A man -- generic man -- a man, to be greatly good, must imagine clearly.
He must see himself and the world through the eyes of another, and of many others.
See himself and the world -- not just the world, but see himself.
What is it that is expected of us by the billions of people who live in what Laurie Garrett the other day so appropriately called despair and disparity?
What is it that they have every right to ask of us?
What is it that we have every right to ask of ourselves, out of our shared humanity and out of the human spirit?
Well, you know precisely what it is.
There's a great deal of argument about whether we, as the great nation that we are, should be the policeman of the world, the world's constabulary, but there should be virtually no argument about whether we should be the world's healer.
There has certainly been no argument about that in this room in the past four days.
So, if we are to be the world's healer, every disadvantaged person in this world -- including in the United States -- becomes our patient.
Every disadvantaged nation, and perhaps our own nation, becomes our patient.
So, it's fun to think about the etymology of the word "patient."
It comes initially from the Latin patior, to endure, or to suffer.
So, you go back to the old Indo-European root again, and what do you find? The Indo-European stem is pronounced payen -- we would spell it P-A-E-N -- and, lo and behold, mirabile dictu, it is the same root as the word compassion comes from, P-A-E-N.
So, the lesson is very clear. The lesson is that our patient -- the world, and the disadvantaged of the world -- that patient deserves our compassion.
But beyond our compassion, and far greater than compassion, is our moral imagination and our identification with each individual who lives in that world, not to think of them as a huge forest, but as individual trees.
Of course, in this day and age, the trick is not to let each tree be obscured by that Bush in Washington that can get -- can get in the way.
(Laughter) So, here we are.
We are, should be, morally committed to being the healer of the world.
And we have had examples over and over and over again -- you've just heard one in the last 15 minutes -- of people who have not only had that commitment, but had the charisma, the brilliance -- and I think in this room it's easy to use the word brilliant, my God -- the brilliance to succeed at least at the beginning of their quest, and who no doubt will continue to succeed, as long as more and more of us enlist ourselves in their cause.
Now, if we're talking about medicine, and we're talking about healing, I'd like to quote someone who hasn't been quoted.
It seems to me everybody in the world's been quoted here: Pogo's been quoted; Shakespeare's been quoted backwards, forwards, inside out.
I would like to quote one of my own household gods.
I suspect he never really said this, because we don't know what Hippocrates really said, but we do know for sure that one of the great Greek physicians said the following, and it has been recorded in one of the books attributed to Hippocrates, and the book is called "Precepts."
And I'll read you what it is.
Remember, I have been talking about, essentially philanthropy: the love of humankind, the individual humankind and the individual humankind that can bring that kind of love translated into action, translated, in some cases, into enlightened self-interest.
And here he is, 2,400 years ago: "Where there is love of humankind, there is love of healing."
We have seen that here today with the sense, with the sensitivity -- and in the last three days, and with the power of the indomitable human spirit.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I became an inventor by accident.
I was out of the air force in 1956. No, no, that's not true: I went in in 1956, came out in 1959, was working at the University of Washington, and I came up with an idea, from reading a magazine article, for a new kind of a phonograph tone arm.
Now, that was before cassette tapes, C.D.s, DVDs -- any of the cool stuff we've got now.
And it was an arm that, instead of hinging and pivoting as it went across the record, went straight: a radial, linear tracking tone arm.
And it was the hardest invention I ever made, but it got me started, and I got really lucky after that.
And without giving you too much of a tirade, I want to talk to you about an invention I brought with me today: my 44th invention. No, that's not true either.
Golly, I'm just totally losing it.
My 44th patent; about the 15th invention.
I call this hypersonic sound.
I'm going to play it for you in a couple minutes, but I want to make an analogy before I do to this.
I usually show this hypersonic sound and people will say, That's really cool, but what's it good for?
And I say, What is the light bulb good for?
Sound, light: I'm going to draw the analogy.
When Edison invented the light bulb, pretty much looked like this.
Hasn't changed that much.
Light came out of it in every direction.
Before the light bulb was invented, people had figured out how to put a reflector behind it, focus it a little bit; put lenses in front of it, focus it a little bit better.
Ultimately we figured out how to make things like lasers that were totally focused.
Now, think about where the world would be today if we had the light bulb, but you couldn't focus light; if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to.
That's the way loudspeakers pretty much are.
You turn on the loudspeaker, and after almost 80 years of having those gadgets, the sound just kind of goes where it wants.
Even when you're standing in front of a megaphone, it's pretty much every direction.
A little bit of differential, but not much.
If the light bulb was the way the speaker is, and you couldn't focus or sharpen the edges or define it, we wouldn't have that, or movies in general, or computers, or T.V. sets, or C.D.s, or DVDs -- and just go down the list of what the importance is of being able to focus light.
Now, after almost 80 years of having sound, I thought it was about time that we figure out a way to put sound where you want to.
I have a couple of units.
That guy there was made for a demo I did yesterday early in the day for a big car maker in Detroit who wants to put them in a car -- small version, over your head -- so that you can actually get binaural sound in a car.
What if I could aim sound the way I aim light?
I got this waterfall I recorded in my back yard.
Now, you're not going to hear a thing unless it hits you.
Maybe if I hit the side wall it will bounce around the room.
(Applause) The sound is being made right next to your ears. Is that cool?
(Applause) Because I have some limited time, I'll cut it off for a second, and tell you about how it works and what it's good for.
Course, like light, it's great to be able to put sound to highlight a clothing rack, or the cornflakes, or the toothpaste, or a talking plaque in a movie theater lobby.
Sony's got an idea -- Sony's our biggest customers right now.
They tried this back in the '60s and were too smart, and so they gave up.
But they want to use it -- seriously.
There's a mix an inventor has to have.
You have to be kind of smart, and though I did not graduate from college doesn't mean I'm stupid, because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today.
Too many other smart people out there. So.
I just happened to get my education in a little different way.
I'm not at all against education.
I think it's wonderful; I think sometimes people, when they get educated, lose it: they get so smart they're unwilling to look at things that they know better than.
And we're living in a great time right now, because almost everything's being explored anew.
I have this little slogan that I use a lot, which is: virtually nothing -- and I mean this honestly -- has been invented yet.
We're just starting.
We're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics.
And this is, I hope, a little piece of it.
Sony's got this vision back -- to get myself on track -- that when you stand in the checkout line in the supermarket, you're going to watch a new T.V. channel.
They know that when you watch T.V. at home, because there are so many choices you can change channels, miss their commercials.
A hundred and fifty-one million people every day stand in the line at the supermarket.
Now, they've tried this a couple years ago and it failed, because the checker gets tired of hearing the same message every 20 minutes, and reaches out, turns off the sound.
And, you know, if the sound isn't there, the sale typically isn't made.
For instance, like, when you're on an airplane, they show the movie, you get to watch it for free; when you want to hear the sound, you pay.
And so ABC and Sony have devised this new thing where when you step in the line in the supermarket -- initially it'll be Safeways. It is Safeways; they're trying this in three parts of the country right now -- you'll be watching TV.
And hopefully they'll be sensitive that they don't want to offend you with just one more outlet.
But what's great about it, from the tests that have been done, is, if you don't want to hear it, you take about one step to the side and you don't hear it.
So, we create silence as much as we create sound.
ATMs that talk to you; nobody else hears it.
Sit in bed, two in the morning, watch TV; your spouse, or someone, is next to you, asleep; doesn't hear it, doesn't wake up.
We're also working on noise canceling things like snoring, noise from automobiles.
I have been really lucky with this technology: all of a sudden as it is ready, the world is ready to accept it.
They have literally beat a path to our door.
We've been selling it since about last September, October, and it's been immensely gratifying.
If you're interested in what it costs -- I'm not selling them today -- but this unit, with the electronics and everything, if you buy one, is around a thousand bucks.
We expect by this time next year, it'll be hundreds, a few hundred bucks, to buy it.
It's not any more pricey than regular electronics.
Now, when I played it for you, you didn't hear the thunderous bass.
This unit that I played goes from about 200 hertz to above the range of hearing.
It's actually emitting ultrasound -- low-level ultrasound -- that's about 100,000 vibrations per second.
And the sound that you're hearing, unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face, is made out in front of it, in the air.
The air is not linear, as we've always been taught.
You turn up the volume just a little bit -- I'm talking about a little over 80 decibels -- and all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate.
Here's why: the speed of sound is not a constant. It's fairly slow.
It changes with temperature and with barometric pressure.
Now, imagine, if you will, without getting too technical, I'm making a little sine wave here in the air.
Well, if I turn up the amplitude too much, I'm having an effect on the pressure, which means during the making of that sine wave, the speed at which it is propagating is shifting.
All of audio as we know it is an attempt to be more and more perfectly linear.
Linearity means higher quality sound.
Hypersonic sound is exactly the opposite: it's 100 percent based on non-linearity.
An effect happens in the air, it's a corrupting effect of the sound -- the ultrasound in this case -- that's emitted, but it's so predictable that you can produce very precise audio out of that effect.
Now, the question is, where's the sound made?
Instead of being made on the face of the cone, it's made at literally billions of little independent points along this narrow column in the air, and so when I aim it towards you, what you hear is made right next to your ears.
I said we can shorten the column, we can spread it out to cover the couch.
I can put it so that one ear hears one speaker, the other ear hears the other. That's true binaural sound.
When you listen to stereo on your home system, your both ears hear both speakers.
Turn on the left speaker sometime and notice you're hearing it also in your right ear.
So, the stage is more restricted -- the sound stage that's supposed to spread out in front of you.
Because the sound is made in the air along this column, it does not follow the inverse square law, which says it drops off about two thirds every time you double the distance: 6dB every time you go from one meter, for instance, to two meters.
That means you go to a rock concert or a symphony, and the guy in the front row gets the same level as the guy in the back row, now, all of a sudden.
Isn't that terrific?
So, we've been, as I say, very successful, very lucky, in having companies catch the vision of this, from cars -- car makers who want to put a stereo system in the front for the kids, and a separate system in the back -- oh, no, the kids aren't driving today.
(Laughter) I was seeing if you were listening.
Actually, I haven't had breakfast yet.
A stereo system in the front for mom and dad, and maybe there's a little DVD player in the back for the kids, and the parents don't want to be bothered with that, or their rap music or whatever.
So, again, this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to is really starting to catch on.
It also works for transmitting and communicating data.
It also works five times better underwater.
We've got the military -- have just deployed some of these into Iraq, where you can put fake troop movements quarter of a mile away on a hillside.
(Laughter) Or you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist some Biblical verse.
(Laughter) I'm serious. And they have these infrared devices that can look at their countenance, and see a fraction of a degree Kelvin in temperature shift from 100 yards away when they play this thing.
And so, another way of hopefully determining who's friendly and who isn't.
We make a version with this which puts out 155 decibels.
Pain is 120.
So it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people, and there can be a public beach just off to the side, and they don't even know it's turned on.
We sell those to the military presently for about 70,000 dollars, and they're buying them as fast as we can make them.
We put it on a turret with a camera, so that when they shoot at you, you're over there, and it's there.
I have a bunch of other inventions.
I invented a plasma antenna, to shift gears.
Looked up at the ceiling of my office one day -- I was working on a ground-penetrating radar project -- and my physicist CEO came in and said, "We have a real problem.
We're using very short wavelengths.
We've got a problem with the antenna ringing.
When you run very short wavelengths, like a tuning fork the antenna resonates, and there's more energy coming out of the antenna than there is the backscatter from the ground that we're trying to analyze, taking too much processing."
I says, "Why don't we make an antenna that only exists when you want it?
Turn it on; turn it off.
That's a fluorescent tube refined."
I just sold that for a million and a half dollars, cash.
I took it back to the Pentagon after it got declassified, when the patent issued, and told the people back there about it, and they laughed, and then I took them back a demo and they bought.
(Laughter) Any of you ever wore a Jabber headphone -- the little cell headphones?
That's my invention. I sold that for seven million dollars.
Big mistake: it just sold for 80 million dollars two years ago.
I actually drew that up on a little crummy Mac computer in my attic at my house, and one of the many designs which they have now is still the same design I drew way back when.
So, I've been really lucky as an inventor.
I'm the happiest guy you're ever going to meet.
And my dad died before he realized anybody in the family would maybe, hopefully, make something out of themselves.
You've been a great audience. I know I've jumped all over the place.
I usually figure out what my talk is when I get up in front of a group.
Let me give you, in the last minute, one more quick demo of this guy, for those of you that haven't heard it.
Can never tell if it's on.
If you haven't heard it, raise your hand.
Getting it over there?
Get the cameraman.
Yeah, there you go.
I've got a Coke can opening that's right in your head; that's really cool.
Thank you once again.
Appreciate it very much.
The cry of the crowd. The roar of a lion. The clash of metal.
Starting in 80 CE these sounds rang through the stands of the Colosseum.
On hundreds of days a year, over 50,000 residents of Rome and visitors from across the Roman Empire would fill the stadiums’ four stories to see gladiators duel, animals fight, and chariots race around the arena.
And for the grand finale, water poured into the arena basin, submerging the stage for the greatest spectacle of all: staged naval battles.
The Romans’ epic, mock maritime encounters, called naumachiae, started during Julius Caesar’s reign in the first century BC, over a hundred years before the Colosseum was built.
They were held alongside other aquatic spectacles on natural and artificial bodies of water around Rome up through Emperor Flavius Vespasian, who began building the Colosseum in 70 CE on the site of a former lake.
The Colosseum was intended to be a symbol of Rome’s power in the ancient world, and what better way to display that power than a body of water that could drain and refill at the Emperor’s command?
Vespasian’s son Flavius Titus fulfilled his father’s dream in 80 CE when he used war spoils to finish the Colosseum– or as it was known at the time, the Flavian Amphitheater.
The grand opening was celebrated with 100 days of pageantry and gladiatorial games, setting the precedent for programming that included parades, musical performances, public executions, and of course, gladiatorial combat.
Unlike the games in smaller amphitheaters funded by wealthy Romans, these lavish displays of Imperial power were financed by the Emperor.
Parades of exotic animals, theatrical performances, and the awe-inspiring naumachiae were all designed to bolster faith in the god-like Emperor, who would be declared a god after his own death.
It’s still a mystery how engineers flooded the arena to create this aquatic effect.
Some historians believe a giant aqueduct was diverted into the arena.
Others think the system of chambers and sluice gates used to drain the arena, were also used to fill it.
These chambers could’ve been filled with water prior to the event and then opened to submerge the stage under more than a million gallons of water, to create a depth of five feet.
But even with all that water, the Romans had to construct miniature boats with special flat bottoms that wouldn’t scrape the Colosseum floor.
These boats ranged from 7 to 15 meters long, and were built to look like vessels from famous encounters.
During a battle, dozens of these ships would float around the arena, crewed by gladiators dressed as the opposing sides of the recreated battle.
These warriors would duel across ships; boarding them, fighting, drowning, and incapacitating their foes until only one faction was left standing.
Fortunately, not every watery display told such a gruesome story.
In some of these floodings, a submerged stage allowed chariot drivers to glide across the water as though they were Triton, making waves as he piloted his chariot on the sea.
Animals walked on water, myths were re-enacted by condemned prisoners, and at night, nude synchronized swimmers would perform by torchlight.
But the Colosseum’s aquatic age didn’t last forever.
The naval battles proved so popular they were given their own nearby lake by Emperor Domitian in the early 90s CE.
The larger lake proved even better for naumachiae, and the Colosseum soon gained a series of underground animal cages and trap doors that didn’t allow for further flooding.
But for a brief time, the Flavian Emperors controlled the tides of war and water in a spectacular show of power.
I am an astrodynamicist -- you know, like that guy Rich Purnell in the movie "The Martian."
And it's my job to study and predict motion of objects in space.
Currently we track about one percent of hazardous objects on orbit -- hazardous to services like location, agriculture, banking, television and communications, and soon -- very soon -- even the internet itself.
Now these services are not protected from, roughly, half a million objects the size of a speck of paint all the way to a school bus in size.
A speck of paint, traveling at the right speed, impacting one of these objects, could render it absolutely useless.
But we can't track things as small as a speck of paint.
We can only track things as small as say, a smartphone.
So of this half million objects that we should be concerned about, we can only track about 26,000 of these objects.
And of these 26,000, only 2,000 actually work.
Everything else is garbage.
That's a lot of garbage.
To make things a little bit worse, most of what we launch into orbit never comes back.
We send the satellite in orbit, it stops working, it runs out of fuel, and we send something else up ...
and then we send up something else ...
and then something else.
And every once in a while, two of these things will collide with each other or one of these things will explode, or even worse, somebody might just happen to destroy one of their satellites on orbit, and this generates many, many more pieces, most of which also never come back.
Now these things are not just randomly scattered in orbit.
It turns out that given the curvature of space-time, there are ideal locations where we put some of these satellites -- think of these as space highways.
Very much like highways on earth, these space highways can only take up a maximum capacity of traffic to sustain space-safe operations.
Unlike highways on earth, there are actually no space traffic rules.
None whatsoever, OK?
Wow.
What could possibly go wrong with that?
(Laughter) Now, what would be really nice is if we had something like a space traffic map, like a Waze for space that I could look up and see what the current traffic conditions are in space, maybe even predict these.
The problem with that, however, is that ask five different people, "What's going on in orbit?
and you're probably going to get 10 different answers.
Why is that?
It's because information about things on orbit is not commonly shared either.
So what if we had a globally accessible, open and transparent space traffic information system that can inform the public of where everything is located to try to keep space safe and sustainable?
And what if the system could be used to form evidence-based norms of behavior -- these space traffic rules?
So I developed ASTRIAGraph, the world's first crowdsourced, space traffic monitoring system at the University of Texas at Austin.
ASTRIAGraph combines multiple sources of information from around the globe -- government, industry and academia -- and represents this in a common framework that anybody can access today.
Here, you can see 26,000 objects orbiting the earth, multiple opinions, and it gets updated in near real time.
But back to my problem of space traffic map: What if you only had information from the US government?
Well, in that case, that's what your space traffic map would look like.
But what do the Russians think?
That looks significantly different.
Who's right? Who's wrong?
What should I believe?
What could I trust?
This is part of the issue.
In the absence of this framework to monitor space-actor behavior, to monitor activity in space -- where these objects are located -- to reconcile these inconsistencies and make this knowledge commonplace, we actually risk losing the ability to use space for humanity's benefit.
Thank you very much.
(Applause and cheers)
Sheryl Shade: Hi, Aimee. Aimee Mullins: Hi.
SS: Aimee and I thought we'd just talk a little bit, and I wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distinctive athlete.
AM: Well, for those of you who have seen the picture in the little bio -- it might have given it away -- I'm a double amputee, and I was born without fibulas in both legs.
I was amputated at age one, and I've been running like hell ever since, all over the place.
SS: Well, why don't you tell them how you got to Georgetown -- why don't we start there?
Why don't we start there?
AM: I'm a senior in Georgetown in the Foreign Service program.
I won a full academic scholarship out of high school.
They pick three students out of the nation every year to get involved in international affairs, and so I won a full ride to Georgetown and I've been there for four years. Love it.
SS: When Aimee got there, she decided that she's, kind of, curious about track and field, so she decided to call someone and start asking about it.
So, why don't you tell that story?
AM: Yeah. Well, I guess I've always been involved in sports.
I played softball for five years growing up.
I skied competitively throughout high school, and I got a little restless in college because I wasn't doing anything for about a year or two sports-wise.
And I'd never competed on a disabled level, you know -- I'd always competed against other able-bodied athletes.
That's all I'd ever known.
In fact, I'd never even met another amputee until I was 17.
And I heard that they do these track meets with all disabled runners, and I figured, "Oh, I don't know about this, but before I judge it, let me go see what it's all about."
So, I booked myself a flight to Boston in '95, 19 years old and definitely the dark horse candidate at this race. I'd never done it before.
I went out on a gravel track a couple of weeks before this meet to see how far I could run, and about 50 meters was enough for me, panting and heaving.
And I had these legs that were made of a wood and plastic compound, attached with Velcro straps -- big, thick, five-ply wool socks on -- you know, not the most comfortable things, but all I'd ever known.
And I'm up there in Boston against people wearing legs made of all things -- carbon graphite and, you know, shock absorbers in them and all sorts of things -- and they're all looking at me like, OK, we know who's not going to win this race.
And, I mean, I went up there expecting -- I don't know what I was expecting -- but, you know, when I saw a man who was missing an entire leg go up to the high jump, hop on one leg to the high jump and clear it at six feet, two inches ...
Dan O'Brien jumped 5'11" in '96 in Atlanta, I mean, if it just gives you a comparison of -- these are truly accomplished athletes, without qualifying that word "athlete."
And so I decided to give this a shot: heart pounding, I ran my first race and I beat the national record-holder by three hundredths of a second, and became the new national record-holder on my first try out.
And, you know, people said, "Aimee, you know, you've got speed -- you've got natural speed -- but you don't have any skill or finesse going down that track.
You were all over the place.
We all saw how hard you were working."
And so I decided to call the track coach at Georgetown.
And I thank god I didn't know just how huge this man is in the track and field world.
He's coached five Olympians, and the man's office is lined from floor to ceiling with All America certificates of all these athletes he's coached.
He's just a rather intimidating figure.
And I called him up and said, "Listen, I ran one race and I won ..."
(Laughter) "I want to see if I can, you know -- I need to just see if I can sit in on some of your practices, see what drills you do and whatever."
That's all I wanted -- just two practices.
"Can I just sit in and see what you do?"
And he said, "Well, we should meet first, before we decide anything."
You know, he's thinking, "What am I getting myself into?"
So, I met the man, walked in his office, and saw these posters and magazine covers of people he has coached.
And we got to talking, and it turned out to be a great partnership because he'd never coached a disabled athlete, so therefore he had no preconceived notions of what I was or wasn't capable of, and I'd never been coached before.
So this was like, "Here we go -- let's start on this trip."
So he started giving me four days a week of his lunch break, his free time, and I would come up to the track and train with him.
So that's how I met Frank.
That was fall of '95. But then, by the time that winter was rolling around, he said, "You know, you're good enough.
You can run on our women's track team here."
And I said, "No, come on."
And he said, "No, no, really. You can.
You can run with our women's track team."
In the spring of 1996, with my goal of making the U.S. Paralympic team that May coming up full speed, I joined the women's track team.
And no disabled person had ever done that -- run at a collegiate level.
So I don't know, it started to become an interesting mix.
SS: Well, on your way to the Olympics, a couple of memorable events happened at Georgetown.
Why don't you just tell them?
AM: Yes, well, you know, I'd won everything as far as the disabled meets -- everything I competed in -- and, you know, training in Georgetown and knowing that I was going to have to get used to seeing the backs of all these women's shirts -- you know, I'm running against the next Flo-Jo -- and they're all looking at me like, "Hmm, what's, you know, what's going on here?"
And putting on my Georgetown uniform and going out there and knowing that, you know, in order to become better -- and I'm already the best in the country -- you know, you have to train with people who are inherently better than you.
And I went out there and made it to the Big East, which was sort of the championship race at the end of the season.
It was really, really hot.
And it's the first -- I had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio, and I didn't realize at that time that the amount of sweating I would be doing in the sock -- it actually acted like a lubricant and I'd be, kind of, pistoning in the socket.
And at about 85 meters of my 100 meters sprint, in all my glory, I came out of my leg.
Like, I almost came out of it, in front of, like, 5,000 people.
And I, I mean, was just mortified -- because I was signed up for the 200, you know, which went off in a half hour.
(Laughter) I went to my coach: "Please, don't make me do this."
I can't do this in front of all those people. My legs will come off.
And if it came off at 85 there's no way I'm going 200 meters.
And he just sat there like this.
My pleas fell on deaf ears, thank god.
Because you know, the man is from Brooklyn; he's a big man. He says, "Aimee, so what if your leg falls off?
You pick it up, you put the damn thing back on, and finish the goddamn race!"
(Laughter) (Applause) And I did. So, he kept me in line.
He kept me on the right track.
SS: So, then Aimee makes it to the 1996 Paralympics, and she's all excited. Her family's coming down -- it's a big deal.
It's now two years that you've been running?
AM: No, a year.
SS: A year. And why don't you tell them what happened right before you go run your race?
AM: Okay, well, Atlanta.
The Paralympics, just for a little bit of clarification, are the Olympics for people with physical disabilities -- amputees, persons with cerebral palsy, and wheelchair athletes -- as opposed to the Special Olympics, which deals with people with mental disabilities.
So, here we are, a week after the Olympics and down at Atlanta, and I'm just blown away by the fact that just a year ago, I got out on a gravel track and couldn't run 50 meters.
And so, here I am -- never lost.
I set new records at the U.S. Nationals -- the Olympic trials -- that May, and was sure that I was coming home with the gold.
I was also the only, what they call "bilateral BK" -- below the knee.
I was the only woman who would be doing the long jump.
I had just done the long jump, and a guy who was missing two legs came up to me and says, "How do you do that? You know, we're supposed to have a planar foot, so we can't get off on the springboard."
I said, "Well, I just did it. No one told me that."
So, it's funny -- I'm three inches within the world record -- and kept on from that point, you know, so I'm signed up in the long jump -- signed up?
No, I made it for the long jump and the 100-meter.
And I'm sure of it, you know?
I made the front page of my hometown paper that I delivered for six years, you know?
It was, like, this is my time for shine.
And we're at the trainee warm-up track, which is a few blocks away from the Olympic stadium.
These legs that I was on, which I'll take out right now -- I was the first person in the world on these legs.
I was the guinea pig., I'm telling you, this was, like -- talk about a tourist attraction.
Everyone was taking pictures -- "What is this girl running on?"
And I'm always looking around, like, where is my competition?
It's my first international meet.
I tried to get it out of anybody I could, you know, "Who am I running against here?"
"Oh, Aimee, we'll have to get back to you on that one."
I wanted to find out times.
"Don't worry, you're doing great."
This is 20 minutes before my race in the Olympic stadium, and they post the heat sheets. And I go over and look.
And my fastest time, which was the world record, was 15.77.
Then I'm looking: the next lane, lane two, is 12.8.
Lane three is 12.5. Lane four is 12.2. I said, "What's going on?"
And they shove us all into the shuttle bus, and all the women there are missing a hand.
(Laughter) So, I'm just, like -- they're all looking at me like 'which one of these is not like the other,' you know?
I'm sitting there, like, "Oh, my god. Oh, my god."
You know, I'd never lost anything, like, whether it would be the scholarship or, you know, I'd won five golds when I skied. In everything, I came in first.
And Georgetown -- that was great.
I was losing, but it was the best training because this was Atlanta.
Here we are, like, crème de la crème, and there is no doubt about it, that I'm going to lose big.
And, you know, I'm just thinking, "Oh, my god, my whole family got in a van and drove down here from Pennsylvania."
And, you know, I was the only female U.S. sprinter.
So they call us out and, you know -- "Ladies, you have one minute."
And I remember putting my blocks in and just feeling horrified because there was just this murmur coming over the crowd, like, the ones who are close enough to the starting line to see.
And I'm like, "I know! Look! This isn't right."
And I'm thinking that's my last card to play here; if I'm not going to beat these girls, I'm going to mess their heads a little, you know?
(Laughter) I mean, it was definitely the "Rocky IV" sensation of me versus Germany, and everyone else -- Estonia and Poland -- was in this heat.
And the gun went off, and all I remember was finishing last and fighting back tears of frustration and incredible -- incredible -- this feeling of just being overwhelmed.
And I had to think, "Why did I do this?"
If I had won everything -- but it was like, what was the point?
All this training -- I had transformed my life.
I became a collegiate athlete, you know. I became an Olympic athlete.
And it made me really think about how the achievement was getting there.
I mean, the fact that I set my sights, just a year and three months before, on becoming an Olympic athlete and saying, "Here's my life going in this direction -- and I want to take it here for a while, and just seeing how far I could push it."
And the fact that I asked for help -- how many people jumped on board?
How many people gave of their time and their expertise, and their patience, to deal with me?
And that was this collective glory -- that there was, you know, 50 people behind me that had joined in this incredible experience of going to Atlanta.
So, I apply this sort of philosophy now to everything I do: sitting back and realizing the progression, how far you've come at this day to this goal, you know.
It's important to focus on a goal, I think, but also recognize the progression on the way there and how you've grown as a person.
That's the achievement, I think. That's the real achievement.
SS: Why don't you show them your legs?
AM: Oh, sure.
SS: You know, show us more than one set of legs.
AM: Well, these are my pretty legs.
(Laughter) No, these are my cosmetic legs, actually, and they're absolutely beautiful.
You've got to come up and see them.
There are hair follicles on them, and I can paint my toenails.
And, seriously, like, I can wear heels.
Like, you guys don't understand what that's like to be able to just go into a shoe store and buy whatever you want.
SS: You got to pick your height?
AM: I got to pick my height, exactly.
(Laughter) Patrick Ewing, who played for Georgetown in the '80s, comes back every summer.
And I had incessant fun making fun of him in the training room because he'd come in with foot injuries.
I'm like, "Get it off! Don't worry about it, you know.
You can be eight feet tall. Just take them off."
(Laughter) He didn't find it as humorous as I did, anyway.
OK, now, these are my sprinting legs, made of carbon graphite, like I said, and I've got to make sure I've got the right socket.
No, I've got so many legs in here.
These are -- do you want to hold that actually?
That's another leg I have for, like, tennis and softball.
It has a shock absorber in it so it, like, "Shhhh," makes this neat sound when you jump around on it. All right.
And then this is the silicon sheath I roll over, to keep it on. Which, when I sweat, you know, I'm pistoning out of it.
SS: Are you a different height?
AM: In these?
SS: In these.
AM: I don't know. I don't think so.
I may be a little taller. I actually can put both of them on.
SS: She can't really stand on these legs. She has to be moving, so ...
AM: Yeah, I definitely have to be moving, and balance is a little bit of an art in them.
But without having the silicon sock, I'm just going to try slip in it.
And so, I run on these, and have shocked half the world on these.
(Applause) These are supposed to simulate the actual form of a sprinter when they run.
If you ever watch a sprinter, the ball of their foot is the only thing that ever hits the track.
So when I stand in these legs, my hamstring and my glutes are contracted, as they would be had I had feet and were standing on the ball of my feet.
(Audience: Who made them?) AM: It's a company in San Diego called Flex-Foot.
And I was a guinea pig, as I hope to continue to be in every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out.
But actually these, like I said, are still the actual prototype.
I need to get some new ones because the last meet I was at, they were everywhere. You know, it's like a big -- it's come full circle.
Moderator: Aimee and the designer of them will be at TEDMED 2, and we'll talk about the design of them.
AM: Yes, we'll do that.
SS: Yes, there you go.
AM: So, these are the sprint legs, and I can put my other...
SS: Can you tell about who designed your other legs?
AM: Yes. These I got in a place called Bournemouth, England, about two hours south of London, and I'm the only person in the United States with these, which is a crime because they are so beautiful.
And I don't even mean, like, because of the toes and everything.
For me, while I'm such a serious athlete on the track, I want to be feminine off the track, and I think it's so important not to be limited in any capacity, whether it's, you know, your mobility or even fashion.
I mean, I love the fact that I can go in anywhere and pick out what I want -- the shoes I want, the skirts I want -- and I'm hoping to try to bring these over here and make them accessible to a lot of people.
They're also silicon.
This is a really basic, basic prosthetic limb under here.
It's like a Barbie foot under this.
(Laughter) It is. It's just stuck in this position, so I have to wear a two-inch heel.
And, I mean, it's really -- let me take this off so you can see it.
I don't know how good you can see it, but, like, it really is.
There're veins on the feet, and then my heel is pink, and my Achilles' tendon -- that moves a little bit.
And it's really an amazing store. I got them a year and two weeks ago.
And this is just a silicon piece of skin.
I mean, what happened was, two years ago this man in Belgium was saying, "God, if I can go to Madame Tussauds' wax museum and see Jerry Hall replicated down to the color of her eyes, looking so real as if she breathed, why can't they build a limb for someone that looks like a leg, or an arm, or a hand?"
I mean, they make ears for burn victims.
They do amazing stuff with silicon.
SS: Two weeks ago, Aimee was up for the Arthur Ashe award at the ESPYs.
And she came into town and she rushed around and she said, "I have to buy some new shoes!"
We're an hour before the ESPYs, and she thought she'd gotten a two-inch heel but she'd actually bought a three-inch heel.
AM: And this poses a problem for me, because it means I'm walking like that all night long.
SS: For 45 minutes. Luckily, the hotel was terrific.
They got someone to come in and saw off the shoes.
(Laughter) AM: I said to the receptionist -- I mean, I am just harried, and Sheryl's at my side -- I said, "Look, do you have anybody here who could help me?
Because I have this problem ... " You know, at first they were just going to write me off, like, "If you don't like your shoes, sorry. It's too late."
"No, no, no, no. I've got these special feet that need a two-inch heel. I have a three-inch heel.
I need a little bit off."
They didn't even want to go there.
They didn't even want to touch that one. They just did it.
No, these legs are great.
I'm actually going back in a couple of weeks to get some improvements.
I want to get legs like these made for flat feet so I can wear sneakers, because I can't with these ones.
So... Moderator: That's it.
SS: That's Aimee Mullins.
(Applause)
So, asking for help is basically the worst, right?
I've actually never seen it on one of those top ten lists of things people fear, like public speaking and death, but I'm pretty sure it actually belongs there.
Even though in many ways it's foolish for us to be afraid to admit we need help, whether it's from a loved one or a friend or from a coworker or even from a stranger, somehow it always feel just a little bit uncomfortable and embarrassing to actually ask for help, which is, of course, why most of us try to avoid asking for help whenever humanly possible.
My father was one of those legions of fathers who, I swear, would rather drive through an alligator-infested swamp than actually ask someone for help getting back to the road.
When I was a kid, we took a family vacation.
We drove from our home in South Jersey to Colonial Williamsburg.
And I remember we got really badly lost.
My mother and I pleaded with him to please just pull over and ask someone for directions back to the highway, and he absolutely refused, and, in fact, assured us that we were not lost, he had just always wanted to know what was over here.
(Laughter) So if we're going to ask for help -- and we have to, we all do, practically every day -- the only way we're going to even begin to get comfortable with it is to get good at it, to actually increase the chances that when you ask for help from someone, they're actually going to say yes.
And not only that, but they're going to find it actually satisfying and rewarding to help you, because that way, they'll be motivated to continue to help you into the future.
So research that I and some of my colleagues have done has shed a lot of light on why it is that sometimes people say yes to our requests for help and why sometimes they say no.
Now let me just start by saying right now: if you need help, you are going to have to ask for it.
OK?
We all, to some extent, suffer from something that psychologists call "the illusion of transparency" -- basically, the mistaken belief that our thoughts and our feelings and our needs are really obvious to other people.
This is not true, but we believe it.
And so, we just mostly stand around waiting for someone to notice our needs and then spontaneously offer to help us with it.
This is a really, really bad assumption.
In fact, not only is it very difficult to tell what your needs are, but even the people close to you often struggle to understand how they can support you.
My partner has actually had to adopt a habit of asking me multiple times a day, "Are you OK? Do you need anything?"
because I am so, so bad at signaling when I need someone's help.
Now, he is more patient than I deserve and much more proactive, much more, about helping than any of us have any right to expect other people to be.
So if you need help, you're going to have to ask for it.
And by the way, even when someone can tell that you need help, how do they know that you want it?
Did you ever try to give unsolicited help to someone who, it turns out, did not actually want your help in the first place?
They get nasty real quick, don't they?
The other day -- true story -- my teenage daughter was getting dressed for school, and I decided to give her some unsolicited help about that.
(Laughter) I happen to think she looks amazing in brighter colors.
She tends to prefer sort of darker, more neutral tones.
And so I said, very helpfully, that I thought maybe she could go back upstairs and try to find something a little less somber.
(Laughter) So, if looks could kill, I would not be standing here right now.
We really can't blame other people for not just spontaneously offering to help us when we don't actually know that that's what is wanted.
In fact, actually, research shows that 90 percent of the help that coworkers give one another in the workplace is in response to explicit requests for help.
So you're going to have to say the words "I need your help." Right?
There's no getting around it.
Now, to be good at it, to make sure that people actually do help you when you ask for it, there are a few other things that are very helpful to keep in mind.
First thing: when you ask for help, be very, very specific about the help you want and why.
Vague, sort of indirect requests for help actually aren't very helpful to the helper, right?
We don't actually know what it is you want from us, and, just as important, we don't know whether or not we can be successful in giving you the help.
Nobody wants to give bad help.
Like me, you probably get some of these requests from perfectly pleasant strangers on LinkedIn who want to do things like "get together over coffee and connect" or "pick your brain."
I ignore these requests literally every time.
And it's not that I'm not a nice person.
It's just that when I don't know what it is you want from me, like the kind of help you're hoping that can I provide, I'm not interested.
Nobody is.
I'd have been much more interested if they had just come out and said whatever it is was they were hoping to get from me, because I'm pretty sure they had something specific in mind.
So go ahead and say, "I'm hoping to discuss opportunities to work in your company," or, "I'd like to propose a joint research project in an area I know you're interested in," or, "I'd like your advice on getting into medical school."
Technically, I can't help you with that last one because I'm not that kind of doctor, but I could point you in the direction of someone who could.
OK, second tip.
This is really important: please avoid disclaimers, apologies and bribes.
Really, really important.
Do any of these sound familiar?
(Clears throat) 'I'm so, so sorry that I have to ask you for this."
"I really hate bothering you with this."
"If I had any way of doing this without your help, I would."
(Laughter) Sometimes it feels like people are so eager to prove that they're not weak and greedy when they ask your for help, they're completely missing out on how uncomfortable they're making you feel.
And by the way -- how am I supposed to find it satisfying to help you if you really hated having to ask me for help?
And while it is perfectly, perfectly acceptable to pay strangers to do things for you, you need to be very, very careful when it comes to incentivizing your friends and coworkers.
When you have a relationship with someone, helping one another is actually a natural part of that relationship.
It's how we show one another that we care.
If you introduce incentives or payments into that, what can happen is, it starts to feel like it isn't a relationship, it's a transaction.
And that actually is experienced as distancing, which, ironically, makes people less likely to help you.
So a spontaneous gift after someone gives you some help to show your appreciation and gratitude -- perfectly fine.
An offer to pay your best friend to help you move into your new apartment is not.
OK, third rule, and I really mean this one: please do not ask for help over email or text.
Really, seriously, please don't.
Email and text are impersonal.
I realize sometimes there's no alternative, but mostly what happens is, we like to ask for help over email and text because it feels less awkward for us to do so.
You know what else feels less awkward over email and text?
Telling you no.
And it turns out, there's research to support this.
In-person requests for help are 30 times more likely to get a yes than a request made by email.
So when something is really important and you really need someone's help, make face time to make the request, or use your phone as a phone -- (Laughter) to ask for the help that you need.
OK.
Last one, and this is actually a really, really important one and probably the one that is most overlooked when it comes to asking for help: when you ask someone for their help and they say yes, follow up with them afterward.
There's a common misconception that what's rewarding about helping is the act of helping itself.
This is not true.
What is rewarding about helping is knowing that your help landed, that it had impact, that you were effective.
If I have no idea how my help affected you, how am I supposed to feel about it?
This happened; I was a university professor for many years, I wrote lots and lots of letters of recommendation for people to get jobs or to go into graduate school.
And probably about 95 percent of them, I have no idea what happened.
Now, how do I feel about the time and effort I took to do that, when I really have no idea if I helped you, if it actually helped you get the thing that you wanted?
In fact, this idea of feeling effective is part of why certain kinds of donor appeals are so, so persuasive -- because they allow you to really vividly imagine the effect that your help is going to have.
Take something like DonorsChoose.
You go online, you can choose the individual teacher by name whose classroom you're going to be able to help by literally buying the specific items they've requested, like microscopes or laptops or flexible seating.
An appeal like that makes it so easy for me to imagine the good that my money will do, that I actually get an immediate sense of effectiveness the minute I commit to giving.
But you know what else they do?
They follow up.
Donors actually get letters from the kids in the classroom.
They get pictures.
They get to know that they made a difference.
And this is something we need to all be doing in our everyday lives, especially if we want people to continue to give us help over the long term.
Take time to tell your colleague that the help that they gave you really helped you land that big sale, or helped you get that interview that you were really hoping to get.
Take time to tell your partner that the support they gave you really made it possible for you to get through a tough time.
Take time to tell your catsitter that you're super happy that for some reason, this time the cats didn't break anything while you were away, and so they must have done a really good job.
The bottom line is: I know -- believe me, I know -- that it is not easy to ask for help.
We are all a little bit afraid to do it.
It makes us feel vulnerable.
But the reality of modern work and modern life is that nobody does it alone.
Nobody succeeds in a vacuum.
More than ever, we actually do have to rely on other people, on their support and collaboration, in order to be successful.
So when you need help, ask for it out loud.
And when you do, do it in a way that increases your chances that you'll get a yes and makes the other person feel awesome for having helped you, because you both deserve it.
Thank you.
"Who’s there?"
Whispered in the dark, this question begins a tale of conspiracy, deception and moral ambiguity.
And in a play where everyone has something to hide, its answer is far from simple.
Written by William Shakespeare between 1599 and 1601, "Hamlet" depicts its titular character haunted by the past, but immobilized by the future.
Mere months after the sudden death of his father, Hamlet returns from school a stranger to his own home, and deeply unsure of what might be lurking in the shadows.
But his brooding takes a turn when he’s visited by a ghost that bears his father’s face.
The phantom claims to be the victim of a “murder most foul,” and convinces Hamlet that his uncle Claudius usurped the throne and stole queen Gertrude’s heart.
The prince’s mourning turns to rage, and he begins to plots his revenge on the new king and his court of conspirators.
The play is an odd sort of tragedy, lacking either the abrupt brutality or all-consuming romance that characterize Shakespeare’s other work in the genre.
Instead it plumbs the depths of its protagonist’s indecisiveness, and the tragic consequences thereof.
The ghost’s revelation draws Hamlet into multiple dilemmas– what should he do, who can he trust, and what role might he play in the course of justice?
These questions are complicated by a tangled web of characters, forcing Hamlet to negotiate friends, family, court counselors, and love interests– many of whom possess ulterior motives.
The prince constantly delays and dithers over how to relate to others, and how he should carry out revenge.
This can make Hamlet more than a little exasperating, but it also makes him one of the most human characters Shakespeare ever created.
Rather than rushing into things, Hamlet becomes consumed with the awful machinations of thinking itself.
And over the course of the play, his endless questions come to echo throughout our own racing minds.
To accomplish this, Shakespeare employs his most introspective language.
From the usurping king’s blazing contemplation of heaven and hell, to the prince’s own cackling meditation on mortality, Shakespeare uses melancholic monologues to breathtaking effect.
This is perhaps best exemplified in Hamlet’s most famous declaration of angst: "To be or not to be—that is the question: Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take arms against a sea of troubles And, by opposing, end them."
This monologue personifies Hamlet’s existential dilemma: being torn between thought and action, unable to choose between life and death.
But his endless questioning raises yet another anxiety: is Hamlet’s madness part of a performance to confuse his enemies, or are we watching a character on the brink of insanity?
These questions weigh heavily on Hamlet’s interactions with every character.
And since he spends much of the play facing inward, he often fails to see the destruction left in his wake.
He’s particularly cruel to Ophelia, his doomed love interest who is brought to madness by the prince’s erratic behavior.
Her fate is one example of how tragedy could have been easily avoided, and shows the ripple effect of Hamlet’s toxic mind games.
Similar warning signs of tragedy are constantly overlooked throughout the play.
Sometimes, these oversights occur because of willful blindness– such as when Ophelia’s father dismisses Hamlet’s alarming actions as mere lovesickness.
At other points, tragedy stems from deliberate duplicity– as when a case of mistaken identity leads to yet more bloodshed.
These moments leave us with the uncomfortable knowledge that tragedy evolves from human error– even if our mistake is to leave things undecided.
For all these reasons, perhaps the one thing we never doubt is Hamlet’s humanity.
But we must constantly grapple with who the “real” Hamlet might be.
Is he a noble son avenging his father?
Or a mad prince creating courtly chaos?
Should he act or observe, doubt or trust?
Who is he? Why is he here?
And who’s out there– waiting in the dark?
Most of the forest lives in the shadow of the giants that make up the highest canopy.
These are the oldest trees, with hundreds of children and thousands of grandchildren.
They check in with their neighbors, sharing food, supplies, and wisdom gained over their long lives.
They do all this rooted in place, unable to speak, reach out, or move around.
The secret to their success lies under the forest floor, where vast root systems support the towering trunks above.
Partnering with these roots are symbiotic fungi called mycorrhizae.
These fungi have countless branching, thread-like hyphae that together make up the mycelium.
The mycelium spreads across a much larger area than the tree root system and connect the roots of different trees together.
These connections form mycorrhizal networks.
Through mycorrhizal networks, fungi can pass resources and signaling molecules between trees.
We know the oldest trees have the largest mycorrhizal networks with the most connections to other trees, but these connections are incredibly complicated to trace.
That’s because there are about a hundred species of mycorrhizal fungi– and an individual tree might be colonized by dozens of different fungal organisms, each of which connects to a unique set of other trees, which in turn each have their own unique set of fungal associations.
To get a sense of how substances flow through this network, let’s zoom in on sugars, as they travel from a mature tree to a neighboring seedling.
Sugar’s journey starts high above the ground, in the leaves of the tallest trees above the canopy.
The leaves use the ample sunlight up there to create sugars through photosynthesis.
This essential fuel then travels through the tree to the base of the trunk in the thick sap.
From there, sugar flows down to the roots.
Mycorrhizal fungi encounter the tips of the roots and either surround or penetrate the outer root cells, depending on the type of fungi.
Fungi cannot produce sugars, though they need them for fuel just like trees do.
They can, however, collect nutrients from the soil much more efficiently than tree roots— and pass these nutrients into the tree roots.
In general, substances flow from where they are more abundant to where they are less abundant, or from source to sink.
That means that the sugars flow from the tree roots into the fungal hyphae.
Once the sugars enter the fungus, they travel along the hyphae through pores between cells or through special hollow transporter hyphae.
The fungus absorbs some of the sugars, but some travels on and enters the roots of a neighboring tree, a seedling that grows in the shade and has less opportunity to photosynthesize sugars.
But why does fungus transport resources from tree to tree?
This is one of the mysteries of the mycorrhizal networks.
It makes sense for fungus to exchange soil nutrients and sugar with a tree— both parties benefit.
The fungus likely benefits in less obvious ways from being part of a network between trees, but the exact ways aren’t totally clear.
Maybe the fungus benefits from having connections with as many different trees as possible, and maximizes its connections by shuttling molecules between trees.
Or maybe plants reduce their contributions to fungi if the fungi don’t facilitate exchanges between trees.
Whatever the reasons, these fungi pass an incredible amount of information between trees.
Through the mycorrhizae, trees can tell when nutrients or signaling molecules are coming from a member of their own species or not.
They can even tell when information is coming from a close relative like a sibling or parent.
Trees can also share information about events like drought or insect attacks through their fungal networks, causing their neighbors to increase production of protective enzymes in anticipation of threats.
The forest’s health relies on these intricate communications and exchanges.
With everything so deeply interconnected, what impacts one species is bound to impact others.
How can we investigate this flora of viruses that surround us, and aid medicine?
How can we turn our cumulative knowledge of virology into a simple, hand-held, single diagnostic assay?
I want to turn everything we know right now about detecting viruses and the spectrum of viruses that are out there into, let's say, a small chip.
When we started thinking about this project -- how we would make a single diagnostic assay to screen for all pathogens simultaneously -- well, there's some problems with this idea.
First of all, viruses are pretty complex, but they're also evolving very fast.
This is a picornavirus.
Picornaviruses -- these are things that include the common cold and polio, things like this.
You're looking at the outside shell of the virus, and the yellow color here are those parts of the virus that are evolving very, very fast, and the blue parts are not evolving very fast.
When people think about making pan-viral detection reagents, usually it's the fast-evolving problem that's an issue, because how can we detect things if they're always changing?
But evolution is a balance: where you have fast change, you also have ultra-conservation -- things that almost never change.
And so we looked into this a little more carefully, and I'm going to show you data now.
This is just some stuff you can do on the computer from the desktop.
I took a bunch of these small picornaviruses, like the common cold, like polio and so on, and I just broke them down into small segments.
And so took this first example, which is called coxsackievirus, and just break it into small windows.
And I'm coloring these small windows blue if another virus shares an identical sequence in its genome to that virus.
These sequences right up here -- which don't even code for protein, by the way -- are almost absolutely identical across all of these, so I could use this sequence as a marker to detect a wide spectrum of viruses, without having to make something individual.
Now, over here there's great diversity: that's where things are evolving fast.
Down here you can see slower evolution: less diversity.
Now, by the time we get out here to, let's say, acute bee paralysis virus -- probably a bad one to have if you're a bee --- this virus shares almost no similarity to coxsackievirus, but I can guarantee you that the sequences that are most conserved among these viruses on the right-hand of the screen are in identical regions right up here.
And so we can encapsulate these regions of ultra-conservation through evolution -- how these viruses evolved -- by just choosing DNA elements or RNA elements in these regions to represent on our chip as detection reagents.
OK, so that's what we did, but how are we going to do that?
Well, for a long time, since I was in graduate school, I've been messing around making DNA chips -- that is, printing DNA on glass.
And that's what you see here: These little salt spots are just DNA tacked onto glass, and so I can put thousands of these on our glass chip and use them as a detection reagent.
We took our chip over to Hewlett-Packard and used their atomic force microscope on one of these spots, and this is what you see: you can actually see the strands of DNA lying flat on the glass here.
So, what we're doing is just printing DNA on glass -- little flat things -- and these are going to be markers for pathogens.
OK, I make little robots in lab to make these chips, and I'm really big on disseminating technology.
If you've got enough money to buy just a Camry, you can build one of these too, and so we put a deep how-to guide on the Web, totally free, with basically order-off-the-shelf parts.
You can build a DNA array machine in your garage.
Here's the section on the all-important emergency stop switch.
(Laughter) Every important machine's got to have a big red button.
But really, it's pretty robust.
You can actually be making DNA chips in your garage and decoding some genetic programs pretty rapidly. It's a lot of fun.
(Laughter) And so what we did -- and this is a really cool project -- we just started by making a respiratory virus chip.
I talked about that -- you know, that situation where you go into the clinic and you don't get diagnosed?
Well, we just put basically all the human respiratory viruses on one chip, and we threw in herpes virus for good measure -- I mean, why not?
The first thing you do as a scientist is, you make sure stuff works.
And so what we did is, we take tissue culture cells and infect them with various viruses, and we take the stuff and fluorescently label the nucleic acid, the genetic material that comes out of these tissue culture cells -- mostly viral stuff -- and stick it on the array to see where it sticks.
Now, if the DNA sequences match, they'll stick together, and so we can look at spots.
And if spots light up, we know there's a certain virus in there.
That's what one of these chips really looks like, and these red spots are, in fact, signals coming from the virus.
And each spot represents a different family of virus or species of virus.
And so, that's a hard way to look at things, so I'm just going to encode things as a little barcode, grouped by family, so you can see the results in a very intuitive way.
What we did is, we took tissue culture cells and infected them with adenovirus, and you can see this little yellow barcode next to adenovirus.
And, likewise, we infected them with parainfluenza-3 -- that's a paramyxovirus -- and you see a little barcode here.
And then we did respiratory syncytial virus.
That's the scourge of daycare centers everywhere -- it's like boogeremia, basically.
(Laughter) You can see that this barcode is the same family, but it's distinct from parainfluenza-3, which gives you a very bad cold.
And so we're getting unique signatures, a fingerprint for each virus.
Polio and rhino: they're in the same family, very close to each other.
Rhino's the common cold, and you all know what polio is, and you can see that these signatures are distinct.
And Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus gives a nice signature down here.
And so it is not any one stripe or something that tells me I have a virus of a particular type here; it's the barcode that in bulk represents the whole thing.
All right, I can see a rhinovirus -- and here's the blow-up of the rhinovirus's little barcode -- but what about different rhinoviruses?
How do I know which rhinovirus I have?
There're 102 known variants of the common cold, and there're only 102 because people got bored collecting them: there are just new ones every year.
And so, here are four different rhinoviruses, and you can see, even with your eye, without any fancy computer pattern-matching recognition software algorithms, that you can distinguish each one of these barcodes from each other.
Now, this is kind of a cheap shot, because I know what the genetic sequence of all these rhinoviruses is, and I in fact designed the chip expressly to be able to tell them apart, but what about rhinoviruses that have never seen a genetic sequencer?
We don't know what the sequence is; just pull them out of the field.
So, here are four rhinoviruses we never knew anything about -- no one's ever sequenced them -- and you can also see that you get unique and distinguishable patterns.
You can imagine building up some library, whether real or virtual, of fingerprints of essentially every virus.
But that's, again, shooting fish in a barrel, you know, right?
You have tissue culture cells. There are a ton of viruses.
What about real people?
You can't control real people, as you probably know.
You have no idea what someone's going to cough into a cup, and it's probably really complex, right?
It could have lots of bacteria, it could have more than one virus, and it certainly has host genetic material.
So how do we deal with this?
And how do we do the positive control here?
Well, it's pretty simple.
That's me, getting a nasal lavage.
And the idea is, let's experimentally inoculate people with virus.
This is all IRB-approved, by the way; they got paid.
And basically we experimentally inoculate people with the common cold virus.
Or, even better, let's just take people right out of the emergency room -- undefined, community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
You have no idea what walks in through the door.
So, let's start off with the positive control first, where we know the person was healthy.
They got a shot of virus up the nose, let's see what happens.
Day zero: nothing happening.
They're healthy; they're clean -- it's amazing.
Actually, we thought the nasal tract might be full of viruses even when you're walking around healthy.
It's pretty clean. If you're healthy, you're pretty healthy.
Day two: we get a very robust rhinovirus pattern, and it's very similar to what we get in the lab doing our tissue culture experiment.
So that's great, but again, cheap shot, right?
We put a ton of virus up this guy's nose. So -- (Laughter) -- I mean, we wanted it to work. He really had a cold.
So, how about the people who walk in off the street?
Here are two individuals represented by their anonymous ID codes.
They both have rhinoviruses; we've never seen this pattern in lab.
We sequenced part of their viruses; they're new rhinoviruses no one's actually even seen.
Remember, our evolutionary-conserved sequences we're using on this array allow us to detect even novel or uncharacterized viruses, because we pick what is conserved throughout evolution.
Here's another guy. You can play the diagnosis game yourself here.
These different blocks represent the different viruses in this paramyxovirus family, so you can kind of go down the blocks and see where the signal is.
Well, doesn't have canine distemper; that's probably good.
(Laughter) But by the time you get to block nine, you see that respiratory syncytial virus.
Maybe they have kids. And then you can see, also, the family member that's related: RSVB is showing up here.
So, that's great.
Here's another individual, sampled on two separate days -- repeat visits to the clinic.
This individual has parainfluenza-1, and you can see that there's a little stripe over here for Sendai virus: that's mouse parainfluenza.
The genetic relationships are very close there. That's a lot of fun.
So, we built out the chip.
We made a chip that has every known virus ever discovered on it.
Why not? Every plant virus, every insect virus, every marine virus.
Everything that we could get out of GenBank -- that is, the national repository of sequences.
Now we're using this chip. And what are we using it for?
Well, first of all, when you have a big chip like this, you need a little bit more informatics, so we designed the system to do automatic diagnosis.
And the idea is that we simply have virtual patterns, because we're never going to get samples of every virus -- it would be virtually impossible. But we can get virtual patterns, and compare them to our observed result -- which is a very complex mixture -- and come up with some sort of score of how likely it is this is a rhinovirus or something.
And this is what this looks like.
If, for example, you used a cell culture that's chronically infected with papilloma, you get a little computer readout here, and our algorithm says it's probably papilloma type 18.
And that is, in fact, what these particular cell cultures are chronically infected with.
So let's do something a little bit harder.
We put the beeper in the clinic.
When somebody shows up, and the hospital doesn't know what to do because they can't diagnose it, they call us.
That's the idea, and we're setting this up in the Bay Area.
And so, this case report happened three weeks ago.
We have a 28-year-old healthy woman, no travel history, [unclear], doesn't smoke, doesn't drink.
10-day history of fevers, night sweats, bloody sputum -- she's coughing up blood -- muscle pain.
She went to the clinic, and they gave her antibiotics and then sent her home.
She came back after ten days of fever, right? Still has the fever, and she's hypoxic -- she doesn't have much oxygen in her lungs.
They did a CT scan.
A normal lung is all sort of dark and black here.
All this white stuff -- it's not good.
This sort of tree and bud formation indicates there's inflammation; there's likely to be infection.
OK. So, the patient was treated then with a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic and doxycycline, and on day three, it didn't help: she had progressed to acute failure.
They had to intubate her, so they put a tube down her throat and they began to mechanically ventilate her.
She could no longer breathe for herself.
What to do next? Don't know.
Switch antibiotics: so they switched to another antibiotic, Tamiflu.
It's not clear why they thought she had the flu, but they switched to Tamiflu.
And on day six, they basically threw in the towel.
You do an open lung biopsy when you've got no other options.
There's an eight percent mortality rate with just doing this procedure, and so basically -- and what do they learn from it?
You're looking at her open lung biopsy.
And I'm no pathologist, but you can't tell much from this.
All you can tell is, there's a lot of swelling: bronchiolitis.
It was "unrevealing": that's the pathologist's report.
And so, what did they test her for?
They have their own tests, of course, and so they tested her for over 70 different assays, for every sort of bacteria and fungus and viral assay you can buy off the shelf: SARS, metapneumovirus, HIV, RSV -- all these.
Everything came back negative, over 100,000 dollars worth of tests.
I mean, they went to the max for this woman.
And basically on hospital day eight, that's when they called us.
They gave us endotracheal aspirate -- you know, a little fluid from the throat, from this tube that they got down there -- and they gave us this.
We put it on the chip; what do we see? Well, we saw parainfluenza-4.
Well, what the hell's parainfluenza-4?
No one tests for parainfluenza-4. No one cares about it.
In fact, it's not even really sequenced that much.
There's just a little bit of it sequenced.
There's almost no epidemiology or studies on it.
No one would even consider it, because no one had a clue that it could cause respiratory failure.
And why is that? Just lore. There's no data -- no data to support whether it causes severe or mild disease.
Clearly, we have a case of a healthy person that's going down.
OK, that's one case report.
I'm going to tell you one last thing in the last two minutes that's unpublished -- it's going to come out tomorrow -- and it's an interesting case of how you might use this chip to find something new and open a new door.
Prostate cancer. I don't need to give you many statistics about prostate cancer. Most of you already know it: third leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S.
Lots of risk factors, but there is a genetic predisposition to prostate cancer.
For maybe about 10 percent of prostate cancer, there are folks that are predisposed to it.
And the first gene that was mapped in association studies for this, early-onset prostate cancer, was this gene called RNASEL.
What is that? It's an antiviral defense enzyme.
So, we're sitting around and thinking, "Why would men who have the mutation -- a defect in an antiviral defense system -- get prostate cancer?
It doesn't make sense -- unless, maybe, there's a virus?"
So, we put tumors --- and now we have over 100 tumors -- on our array.
And we know who's got defects in RNASEL and who doesn't.
And I'm showing you the signal from the chip here, and I'm showing you for the block of retroviral oligos.
And what I'm telling you here from the signal, is that men who have a mutation in this antiviral defense enzyme, and have a tumor, often have -- 40 percent of the time -- a signature which reveals a new retrovirus.
OK, that's pretty wild. What is it?
So, we clone the whole virus.
First of all, I'll tell you that a little automated prediction told us it was very similar to a mouse virus.
But that doesn't tell us too much, so we actually clone the whole thing.
And the viral genome I'm showing you right here?
It's a classic gamma retrovirus, but it's totally new; no one's ever seen it before.
Its closest relative is, in fact, from mice, and so we would call this a xenotropic retrovirus, because it's infecting a species other than mice.
And this is a little phylogenetic tree to see how it's related to other viruses.
We've done it for many patients now, and we can say that they're all independent infections.
They all have the same virus, but they're different enough that there's reason to believe that they've been independently acquired.
Is it really in the tissue? And I'll end up with this: yes.
We take slices of these biopsies of tumor tissue and use material to actually locate the virus, and we find cells here with viral particles in them.
These guys really do have this virus.
Does this virus cause prostate cancer?
Nothing I'm saying here implies causality. I don't know.
Is it a link to oncogenesis? I don't know.
Is it the case that these guys are just more susceptible to viruses?
Could be. And it might have nothing to do with cancer.
But now it's a door.
We have a strong association between the presence of this virus and a genetic mutation that's been linked to cancer.
That's where we're at.
So, it opens up more questions than it answers, I'm afraid, but that's what, you know, science is really good at.
This was all done by folks in the lab -- I cannot take credit for most of this.
This is a collaboration between myself and Don.
This is the guy who started the project in my lab, and this is the guy who's been doing prostate stuff.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
How do we get people engaged in solving global warming?
I'd like to start with running two short experiments with you all.
So your task is to notice if you feel any difference as I speak.
OK?
Here we go.
We are seeing rising carbon dioxide levels, now about 410 ppms.
To avoid the RCP 8.5 scenario, we need rapid decarbonization.
The global carbon budget for 66 percent likelihood to meet the two-degree target is approximately 800 gigatons.
(Laughter) OK, now let me try something else.
We are heading for an uninhabitable earth: monster storms, killer floods, devastating wildfires, crazy heat waves that will cook us under a blazing sun.
2017 is already so unexpectedly warm, it's freaking out climate scientists.
We have a three-year window to cut emissions, three years.
If not, we will soon live in a boiling earth, a hellhole.
OK. So -- (Applause) Now your task: How did these ways of speaking make you feel?
The first, detached maybe or just confused?
What's this guy talking about?
The other, fearful or just numb?
So again, the question I asked: How do we get people engaged in solving global warming?
And why don't these two ways of communicating work?
You see, the biggest obstacle to dealing with climate disruptions lies between your ears.
Building on a rapidly growing body of psychology and social science, I spent years looking into the five inner defenses that stop people from engaging.
When people hear news about the climate coming straight at them, the first defense comes up rapidly: distance.
When we hear about the climate, we hear about something far away in space -- think Arctic ice, polar bears -- far away in time -- think 2100.
It's huge and slow-moving -- think gigatons and centuries.
So it's not here. It's not now.
Since it feels so far away from me, it seems outside my circle of influence, so I feel helpless about it.
There's nothing I can do.
In our everyday lives, most of us prefer to think about nearer things, such as our jobs, our kids, how many likes we get on Facebook.
Now, that, that's real.
Next defense is doom.
Climate change is usually framed as a looming disaster, bringing losses, cost and sacrifice.
That makes us fearful.
But after the first fear is gone, my brain soon wants to avoid this topic altogether.
After 30 years of scary climate change communications, more than 80 percent of media articles still use disaster framings, but people habituate to and then -- desensitize to doom overuse.
So many of us are now suffering a kind of apocalypse fatigue, getting numb from too much collapse porn.
The third defense is dissonance.
Now, if what we know, that fossil fuel use contributes to global warming, conflicts with what we do -- drive, fly, eat beef -- then so-called cognitive dissonance sets in.
This is felt as an inner discomfort.
We may feel like hypocrites.
To get rid of this discomfort, our brain starts coming up with justifications.
So I can say, for instance, "My neighbor, he has a much bigger car than I do."
Or, "Changing my diet doesn't amount to anything if I am the only one to do it."
Or, I could even want to doubt climate science itself.
I could say, "You know, climate is always changing."
So these justifications make us all feel better, but at the expense of dismissing what we know.
Thus, behavior drives attitudes.
My personal cognitive dissonance comes up when I recognize that I've been flying from Oslo to New York and back to Oslo in order to speak about the climate.
(Laughter) For 14 minutes.
(Laughter) So that makes me want to move on to denial.
(Laughter) So if we keep silent, ignore or ridicule facts about climate disruptions, then we might find inner refuge from fear and guilt.
Denial doesn't really come from lack of intelligence or knowledge.
No, denial is a state of mind in which I may be aware of some troubling knowledge, but I live and act as if I don't know.
So you could call it a kind of double life, both knowing and not knowing, and often this is reinforced by others, my family or community, agreeing not to raise this tricky topic.
Finally, identity.
Alarmed climate activists demand that government takes action, either with regulation or carbon taxes.
But consider what happens when people who hold conservative values, for instance, hear from an activist that government ought to expand even further.
Particularly in rich Western democracies, they are then less likely to believe that science.
How is that?
Well, if I hold conservative values, for instance, I probably prefer big proper cars and small government over tiny, tiny cars and huge government.
And if climate science comes and then says government should expand further, then I probably will trust that science less.
In this way, cultural identity starts to override the facts.
The values eat the facts, and my identity trumps truth any day.
So, after recognizing how these five D's kill engagement, how can we move beyond them?
New research shows how we can flip these five defenses over into key success criteria for a more brain-friendly climate communication.
So this is where it gets really exciting and where we find the five S's, the five evidence-based solutions for what does work.
First, we can flip distance to social.
We can make climate feel near, personal and urgent by bringing it home, and we can do that by spreading social norms that are positive to solutions.
If I believe my friends or neighbors, you guys, will do something, then I will, too.
We can see, for instance, this from rooftop solar panels.
They are spreading from neighbor to neighbor like a virus.
It's contagious.
This is the power of peer-to-peer creating the new normal.
Next, we can flip doom to supportive.
Rather than backfiring frames such as disaster and cost, we can reframe climate as being really about human health, for instance, with plant-based delicious burgers, good for you and good for the climate.
We can also reframe climate as being about new tech opportunities, about safety and about new jobs.
Solar jobs, for instance, are seeing an amazing growth.
They just passed the three million jobs mark.
Psychology says, in order to create engagement, we should present, on balance, three positive or supportive framings for each climate threat we mention.
Then we can flip dissonance to simpler actions.
This is often called nudging.
The idea is, by better choice architecture, we can make the climate-friendly behaviors default and convenient.
Let me illustrate this. Take food waste.
Food waste at buffets goes way down if the plate or the box size is reduced a little, because on the smaller plate it looks full but in the big box it looks half empty, so we put more in.
So smaller plates make a big difference for food waste.
And there are hundreds of smart nudges like this.
The point is, dissonance goes down as more behaviors are nudged.
Then we can flip denial by tailoring signals that visualize our progress.
We can provide motivating feedback on how well we're doing with our problem-solving.
Say you improved your transport footprint or cut energy waste in your buildings.
Then one app that can share this well is called Ducky.
The idea is, you log your actions there, and then you can see how well your team or company is doing, so you get real-time signals.
Finally, identity.
We can flip identity with better stories.
Our brain loves stories.
So we need better stories of where we all want to go, and we need more stories of the heroes and heroines of all stripes that are making real change happen.
I'm proud that my hometown of Oslo is now embarking on a bold journey of electrifying all transport, whether cars, bikes or buses.
One of the people spearheading this is Christina Bu.
She is heading the Electric Vehicle Association for years and she has been fighting every day.
Now, the UK and France, India and China have also announced plans for ending the sales of fossil cars.
Now, that's massive.
And in Oslo, we can see how enthusiastic EV owners go and tell their electric stories to friends and neighbors and bring them along.
So we come full circle from story back to social.
So thousands of climate communicators are now starting to use these solutions all over the world.
It is clear, however, that individual solutions are not sufficient to solving climate alone, but they do build stronger bottom-up support for policies and solutions that can.
That is why engaging people is so crucial.
I started this talk with testing two ways of communicating climate with you.
There is another way, too, I'd like to share with you.
It starts with reimagining climate itself as the living air.
Climate isn't really about some abstract, distant climate far, far away from us.
It's about this air that surrounds us.
This air, you can feel in this room, too, the air that moves right now in your nostrils.
This air is our earth's skin.
It's amazingly thin, compared to the size of the earth and the cosmos it shields us from, far thinner than the skin of an apple compared to its diameter.
It may look infinite when we look up, but the beautiful, breathable air is only like five to seven miles thin, a fragile wrapping around a massive ball.
Inside this skin, we're all closely connected.
The breath that you just took contained around 400,000 of the same argon atoms that Gandhi breathed during his lifetime.
Inside this thin, fluctuating, unsettled film, all of life is nourished, protected and held.
It insulates and regulates temperatures in a range that is just right for water and for life as we know it, and mediating between the blue ocean and black eternity, the clouds carry all the billions of tons of water needed for the soils.
The air fills the rivers, stirs the waters, waters the forests.
With a global weirding of the weather, there are good reasons for feeling fear and despair, yet we may first grieve today's sorry state and losses and then turn to face the future with sober eyes and determination.
The new psychology of climate action lies in letting go, not of science, but of the crutches of abstractions and doomism, and then choosing to tell the new stories.
These are the stories of how we achieve drawdown, the reversing of global warming.
These are the stories of the steps we take as peoples, cities, companies and public bodies in caring for the air in spite of strong headwinds.
These are the stories of the steps we take because they ground us in what we are as humans: earthlings inside this living air.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Natalie MacMaster: I'm going to just quickly start out with a little bit of music here. (Applause) (Music) (Applause) Thank you! (Applause) I took my shoes off to dance, but maybe I'll get at that later.
Anyways, I... where to start?
Well, I'm really excited to talk a bit about my own upbringing in music and family and all of that, but I'm even more excited for you people to hear about Donnell's amazing family and maybe even a little bit about how we met, and all that sort of thing, but for those of you that may not be familiar with my upbringing, I'm from Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, eastern Canada, which is a very, very musical island, and its origins come from Scotland with the music and all the traditions, the dancing, the language, which unfortunately is dying out in Cape Breton.
The traditional language is Gaelic, but a lot of the music came from the Gaelic language, and the dancing and the singing and everything, and my bloodline is Scottish through and through, but my mother and father are two very, very musical people.
My mom taught me to dance when I was five, and my dad taught me to play fiddle when I was nine.
My uncle is a very well-known Cape Breton fiddler.
His name's Buddy MacMaster, and just a wonderful guy, and we have a great tradition at home called square dancing, and we had parties, great parties at our house and the neighbors' houses, and you talk about kitchen cèilidhs.
Well, cèilidh first of all is Gaelic for party, but kitchen party in Cape Breton is very common, and basically somebody drops into the house, and no matter what house you go to in Cape Breton, there's a fiddle there, guaranteed, and I'd say, well there's first of all more fiddlers per capita in Cape Breton than anywhere in the world, so ten chances to one, the fellow who walked in the door could play it, so you'd have someone come into the house, you'd invite them to play a tune, and lo and behold a little party would start up and somebody would dance, and somebody would sing, and all that sort of thing, so it was a wonderful, wonderful way to grow up, and that is where my beginnings in music come from: my surroundings, my family, just my bloodline in itself, and, oh, I've done lots of things with my music.
I've recorded lots of CDs.
I was nominated for a Grammy and I've won some awards and stuff like that, so that's awesome, but the best part was meeting my husband, and I've actually known Donnell for probably 12 years now, and I'm going to get into a little bit of, I guess, how music brought us together, but I'm going to introduce you right now to my new husband as of October 5, Donnell Leahy. (Applause) (Applause) Donnell Leahy: Thank you. I'm kind of new to the TED experience and I'm glad to be here, but I'm just trying to put it all together, trying to figure all you people out, and I've been here for a short while, and I'm starting to understand a little bit better.
So I asked Natalie, what do I do?
And she said, just talk about yourself.
It's kind of boring, but I'll just tell you a little bit about my family. I'm one of 11 brothers and sisters from Lakefield, Ontario, an hour and a half northeast of Toronto, and we grew up on a farm.
Mom and Dad raised beef cattle, and I'm the oldest boy.
There are four girls a little bit older than me.
We grew up without a television.
People find that strange, but I think it was a great blessing for us.
We had a television for a few years, but of course we wasted so much time and the work wasn't getting done, so out went the television.
We grew up playing— Mom's from Cape Breton, coincidentally.
Mom and Natalie's mother knew each other. We grew up playing, and used to dance together, right, yeah.
(Laughter) We grew up playing a bunch of, we played by ear and I think that's important for us because we were not really exposed to a lot of different styles of music.
We learned to play the instruments, but we kind of had to come from within or go from within, because we didn't watch television, we didn't listen to a lot of radio. We went to church and to school sometimes, and farmed and played music, so we were able, I think, at a very critical age to develop our own style, our own self, and my mother plays, my father plays, and the style that came from the Ottawa Valley in Ontario, we call it French-Canadian style but it originated in logging camps.
Years ago, hundreds of men would go up for the winter to the camps in Northern Ontario and in Quebec, and they were all different cultures, and the Irish, the French, Scottish, German, they'd all meet, and of course at night, they'd play cards and step dance and play fiddles, and over the course of many years, the Ottawa Valley fiddling kind of evolved and the Ottawa Valley step dancing evolved, so that's, I kind of started out with that style and I quickly started doing my own thing, and then I met Natalie, and I was exposed to the great Cape Breton fiddling.
That's how we met. (Laughter) You tell them. (Laughter) NM: You want to or no? (Laughter) Well I guess I have to now.
Well, it's just so interesting that Donnell's upbringing was very similar to mine, and I actually saw Donnell play when I was about 12 years old, and he and his family came to Inverness, which is about 45 minutes from where I lived, and I was just blown away, like, it was just amazing, and you'll find out why pretty soon here, but I couldn't believe the fiddling and Mom was there with me, and she was saying — Donnell's mother came up on stage and danced with her children, and Mom was saying, "That's Julie MacDonnell, I used to dance with her when we were kids. Little did I think our children would be playing instruments, you know, playing music, yeah."
Twelve years, er, 20 years later little did she think her kids would be getting married, but anyway, so, then I got a phone call about, I dunno, seven years later. I was 19, first or second year of college, and it was Donnell, and he said "Hi, you probably don't know me but my name is Donnell Leahy."
And I said, "I know you.
I have a tape of yours at home."
And he said, "Well, I'm in Truro," which is where I was, and he asked me out for supper.
That's it. (Laughter) (Applause) Then — Will I keep going? (Laughs) (Laughter) Then we dated for two years, broke up for 10, got back together and got married. (Laughter) (Applause) DL: So anyway, we're running out of time, so I'll just get to it.
I'm going to play a piece of music for you.
It's actually a Scottish piece I've chosen.
I starts out with a slow air.
Airs were played in Europe at burials, as a body was carried out from the wake site to the burial site, the procession was led by a piper or a fiddle player.
I'll quickly play a short part of the air, and then I'm going to get into kind of a crazy tune that is very difficult to play when you're not warmed up, so, if I mess it up, pretend you like it anyway. It's called The Banks.
(Tuning) (Laughter) (Music) (Applause) NM: Well, we're gonna play one together now. (Applause) We're laughing, like, because our styles are totally different, as you can hear.
And so, you know, Donnell and I are actually in the process of writing new pieces of music together that we can play, but we don't have any of those ready.
We just started yesterday. (Laughter) So we're gonna play something together anyway.
NM: With one minute.
(Audience reaction) DL: You start. NM: No, you have to start, because you've got to do your thing.
(Music) NM: I'm not tuned. Hold on.
(Tuning) NM: I feel like I'm in the duck or the bird pose right now. (Laughter) (Music) (Audience claps along) (Applause) Announcer: Great news, they're running late downstairs.
We've got another 10 minutes.
(Applause) NM: Okay. Sure.
All right, okay.
Let's get her going. (Applause) (Tuning) DL: What do you want to play?
NM: Well, um...
(Music) (Laughter) NM: Uh, sure.
NM: Not too fast.
(Music) (Audience claps along) (Cheering) (Audience claps along) (Music) (Applause) DL: We're going to play a tune and Natalie's going to accompany me on the piano.
The Cape Breton piano playing is just awesome. It's very rhythmic and, you'll see it.
My mom plays piano, and she learned to play before they had a piano at home in Cape Breton. Before Mom's family had a piano in Cape Breton, she learned to play the rhythms on a piece of board, and the fiddlers would all congregate to play on the cold winter's evenings and Mom would be banging on this board, so when they bought a piano, they bought it in Toronto and had it taken by train and brought in on a horse, a horse and sleigh to the house.
It became the only piano in the region, and Mom said she could basically play as soon as the piano arrived, she could play it because she had learned all these rhythms. Anyway, we found the piano last year and were able to bring it back home. We purchased it.
It had gone through, like, five or six families, and it was just a big thing for us, and we found actually an old picture of somebody and their family years ago.
Anyway, I'm blabbering on here.
NM: No, I want you to tell them about Leahy.
DL: What about Leahy? (Laughter) NM: Just tell them what— DL: She wants me to talk about— We have a band named Leahy.
There's 11 siblings. We, um— What will I tell them? (Laughter) We opened— NM: No surgeries.
DL: No surgeries, oh yeah.
We had a great opportunity.
We opened for Shania Twain for two years on her international tour.
It was a big thing for us, and now all my sisters are off having babies and the boys are all getting married, so we're staying close to home for, I guess, another couple of weeks.
What can I say? I don't know what to say, Natalie. We, uh... (Laughter) (Laughter) NM: Is this what marriage is about?
(Applause) I like it. (Applause) (Laughter) DL: Oh yeah, okay, in my family we had seven girls, four boys, we had two fiddles and one piano, and of course we were all fighting to play on the instruments, so dad and mom set a rule that you couldn't kick anyone off the instrument. You had to wait until they were finished, so of course, what we would do is we'd get on the piano and you wouldn't even get off to eat, because you wouldn't want to give it up to your brother or sister, and they'd wait and wait and wait, and it'd be midnight and you'd be still sitting there on the piano, but it was their way to get us to practice.
Will we play a tune?
NM: It worked. DL: It worked.
So this is our last number, and we'll feature Nat on piano.
(Music) (Applause)
As a roboticist, I get asked a lot of questions.
"When we will they start serving me breakfast?"
So I thought the future of robotics would be looking more like us.
I thought they would look like me, so I built eyes that would simulate my eyes.
I built fingers that are dextrous enough to serve me ...
baseballs.
Classical robots like this are built and become functional based on the fixed number of joints and actuators.
And this means their functionality and shape are already fixed at the moment of their conception.
So even though this arm has a really nice throw -- it even hit the tripod at the end-- it's not meant for cooking you breakfast per se.
It's not really suited for scrambled eggs.
So this was when I was hit by a new vision of future robotics: the transformers.
They drive, they run, they fly, all depending on the ever-changing, new environment and task at hand.
To make this a reality, you really have to rethink how robots are designed.
So, imagine a robotic module in a polygon shape and using that simple polygon shape to reconstruct multiple different forms to create a new form of robot for different tasks.
In CG, computer graphics, it's not any news -- it's been done for a while, and that's how most of the movies are made.
But if you're trying to make a robot that's physically moving, it's a completely new story.
It's a completely new paradigm.
But you've all done this.
Who hasn't made a paper airplane, paper boat, paper crane?
Origami is a versatile platform for designers.
From a single sheet of paper, you can make multiple shapes, and if you don't like it, you unfold and fold back again.
Any 3D form can be made from 2D surfaces by folding, and this is proven mathematically.
And imagine if you were to have an intelligent sheet that can self-fold into any form it wants, anytime.
And that's what I've been working on.
I call this robotic origami, "robogami."
This is our first robogami transformation that was made by me about 10 years ago.
From a flat-sheeted robot, it turns into a pyramid and back into a flat sheet and into a space shuttle.
Quite cute.
Ten years later, with my group of ninja origami robotic researchers -- about 22 of them right now -- we have a new generation of robogamis, and they're a little more effective and they do more than that.
So the new generation of robogamis actually serve a purpose.
For example, this one actually navigates through different terrains autonomously.
So when it's a dry and flat land, it crawls.
And if it meets sudden rough terrain, it starts rolling.
It does this -- it's the same robot -- but depending on which terrain it meets, it activates a different sequence of actuators that's on board.
And once it meets an obstacle, it jumps over it.
It does this by storing energy in each of its legs and releasing it and catapulting like a slingshot.
And it even does gymnastics.
Yay.
(Laughter) So I just showed you what a single robogami can do.
Imagine what they can do as a group.
They can join forces to tackle more complex tasks.
Each module, either active or passive, we can assemble them to create different shapes.
Not only that, by controlling the folding joints, we're able to create and attack different tasks.
The form is making new task space.
And this time, what's most important is the assembly.
They need to autonomously find each other in a different space, attach and detach, depending on the environment and task.
And we can do this now.
So what's next?
Our imagination.
This is a simulation of what you can achieve with this type of module.
We decided that we were going to have a four-legged crawler turn into a little dog and make small gaits.
With the same module, we can actually make it do something else: a manipulator, a typical, classical robotic task.
So with a manipulator, it can pick up an object.
Of course, you can add more modules to make the manipulator legs longer to attack or pick up objects that are bigger or smaller, or even have a third arm.
For robogamis, there's no one fixed shape nor task.
They can transform into anything, anywhere, anytime.
So how do you make them?
The biggest technical challenge of robogami is keeping them super thin, flexible, but still remaining functional.
They're composed of multiple layers of circuits, motors, microcontrollers and sensors, all in the single body, and when you control individual folding joints, you'll be able to achieve soft motions like that upon your command.
Instead of being a single robot that is specifically made for a single task, robogamis are optimized to do multi-tasks.
And this is quite important for the difficult and unique environments on the Earth as well as in space.
Space is a perfect environment for robogamis.
You cannot afford to have one robot for one task.
Who knows how many tasks you will encounter in space?
What you want is a single robotic platform that can transform to do multi-tasks.
What we want is a deck of thin robogami modules that can transform to do multiples of performing tasks.
And don't take my word for it, because the European Space Agency and Swiss Space Center are sponsoring this exact concept.
So here you see a couple of images of reconfiguration of robogamis, exploring the foreign land aboveground, on the surface, as well as digging into the surface.
It's not just exploration.
For astronauts, they need additional help, because you cannot afford to bring interns up there, either.
(Laughter) They have to do every tedious task.
They may be simple, but super interactive.
So you need robots to facilitate their experiments, assisting them with the communications and just docking onto surfaces to be their third arm holding different tools.
But how will they be able to control robogamis, for example, outside the space station?
In this case, I show a robogami that is holding space debris.
You can work with your vision so that you can control them, but what would be better is having the sensation of touch directly transported onto the hands of the astronauts.
And what you need is a haptic device, a haptic interface that recreates the sensation of touch.
And using robogamis, we can do this.
This is the world's smallest haptic interface that can recreate a sensation of touch just underneath your fingertip.
We do this by moving the robogami by microscopic and macroscopic movements at the stage.
And by having this, not only will you be able to feel how big the object is, the roundness and the lines, but also the stiffness and the texture.
Alex has this interface just underneath his thumb, and if he were to use this with VR goggles and hand controllers, now the virtual reality is no longer virtual.
It becomes a tangible reality.
The blue ball, red ball and black ball that he's looking at is no longer differentiated by colors.
Now it is a rubber blue ball, sponge red ball and billiard black ball.
This is now possible.
Let me show you.
This is really the first time this is shown live in front of a public grand audience, so hopefully this works.
So what you see here is an atlas of anatomy and the robogami haptic interface.
So, like all the other reconfigurable robots, it multitasks.
Not only is it going to serve as a mouse, but also a haptic interface.
So for example, we have a white background where there is no object.
That means there is nothing to feel, so we can have a very, very flexible interface.
Now, I use this as a mouse to approach skin, a muscular arm, so now let's feel his biceps, or shoulders.
So now you see how much stiffer it becomes.
Let's explore even more.
Let's approach the ribcage.
And as soon as I move on top of the ribcage and between the intercostal muscles, which is softer and harder, I can feel the difference of the stiffness.
Take my word for it.
So now you see, it's much stiffer in terms of the force it's giving back to my fingertip.
So I showed you the surfaces that aren't moving.
How about if I were to approach something that moves, for example, like a beating heart?
What would I feel?
(Applause) This can be your beating heart.
This can actually be inside your pocket while you're shopping online.
Now you'll be able to feel the difference of the sweater that you're buying, how soft it is, if it's actually cashmere or not, or the bagel that you're trying to buy, how hard it is or how crispy it is.
This is now possible.
The robotics technology is advancing to be more personalized and adaptive, to adapt to our everyday needs.
This unique specie of reconfigurable robotics is actually the platform to provide this invisible, intuitive interface to meet our exact needs.
These robots will no longer look like the characters from the movies.
Instead, they will be whatever you want them to be.
Thank you.
(Applause)
In 2008, archeologists uncovered two 9,000-year old skeletons.
There’s no definitive way of knowing what killed these ancient people, but we do know their bones were infected by an all too familiar bacterium.
The ancient Greeks knew its consumptive effects as phthisis; the Incans called it chaky oncay; and the English called it tuberculosis.
Today, tuberculosis, or TB, is still one of the world’s biggest infectious killers, causing more deaths than malaria or even HIV and AIDS.
But what exactly is this disease, and how has this pathogen persisted for so long?
Typically, TB bacteria called mycobacterium tuberculosis, are airborne.
They travel into our airways and infect our lungs.
Here, immune cells called macrophages rush to the infection site, attempting to absorb and break down the bacterial invaders.
In many cases, this response is enough to remove the bacteria.
But in individuals with other medical conditions– ranging from malnutrition and HIV to diabetes and pregnancy –the immune response may not be strong enough to destroy the intruder.
If so, mycobacterium tuberculosis will reproduce inside those macrophages, and form colonies in the surrounding lung tissue.
As they infect more cells, the bacteria employ cell-degrading enzymes that destroy the infected tissue, triggering chest pain, and causing patients to cough up blood.
The damage to the lungs leads to oxygen deprivation.
This begins a flood of hormonal changes– including a decrease in appetite and iron production.
From here, microbes can spread to the skeletal system, causing back pain and difficulty moving; to the kidneys and intestines, causing abdominal pain; and to the brain, causing headaches and even impaired consciousness.
These symptoms produce the classic image of TB: weight loss, a hacking, bloody cough, and ashen skin.
This ghostly appearance earned TB the title of the ‘White Plague’ in Victorian-era England.
During this period, tuberculosis was considered a ‘romantic disease,' because it tended to affect poverty- stricken artists and poets– those with weaker immune systems.
TB’s outward symptoms even helped fuel the popular myth of vampirism.
In spite of– or perhaps because of these less than scientific concerns, this period also marked the first strides toward curing TB.
In 1882, the German physician Robert Koch identified the disease’s bacterial origins.
13 years later, physicist Wilhelm Roentgen discovered the X-ray, enabling physicians to diagnose and track its progression through the body.
These techniques allowed researchers to develop reliable and effective vaccines– first for smallpox, and again in 1921, when scientists developed the BCG vaccine to battle TB.
These developments laid the groundwork for the modern field of antibiotics– currently home to our most effective TB treatments.
But, antibiotics fail to address a major diagnostic complication: about 90% of people infected with TB don’t show any symptoms.
In these latent infections, the TB bacterium may be dormant, only activating when someone’s immune system is too weak to mount a defense.
This makes TB much harder to diagnose.
And even when properly identified, traditional treatments can take up to 9 months, requiring multiple drugs and a high potential for side effects.
This discourages people from finishing the full course, and partial treatment enables bacteria to develop resistance to these drugs.
Today, the disease is still prevalent in 30 countries, most of which face other health crises that exacerbate TB and trigger latent cases.
Worse still, accessing treatment can be difficult in many of these countries, and the stigma towards TB can discourage people from getting the help they need.
Health experts agree we need to develop better diagnostics, faster acting antibiotics, and more effective vaccines.
Researchers have already developed a urine test that yields results in 12 hours, as well as a new oral treatment that could cut treatment time by 75%.
Hopefully, with advancements like these, we’ll finally be able to make TB exclusively a thing of the past.
Leah Chase: Oh, this is beautiful.
Oh, gosh, I never saw such a room and beauty and strength like I'm looking at.
That's gorgeous. It is.
It is a beautiful room.
Pat Mitchell: I almost said your age, because you gave me permission, but I realized that I was about to make you a year older.
You're only 94.
(Laughter) (Applause) LC: Yeah, I'm only 94.
(Applause) I mean, you get this old and parts start wearing out.
Your legs start wearing out.
The one thing that my children always say: "But nothing happened to your mouth."
(Laughter) So you've got to have something going, so I've got my mouth going.
(Laughter) PM: So Mrs. Chase, the first time we were there, I brought a group of young women, who work with us at TED, into the kitchen, and we were all standing around and you had already cooked lunch for hundreds of people, as you do every day, and you looked up at them.
You have to share with this audience what you said to those young women.
LC: Well, you know, I talk to young women all the time, and it's beginning to bother me, because look how far I came.
I'd come with women that had to really hustle and work hard, and they knew how to be women.
They didn't play that man down.
And, well, we didn't have the education you have today, and God, I'm so proud when I see those women with all that education under their belt.
That's why I worked hard, tried to get everybody to use those resources.
So they just don't know their power, and I always tell them, just look at my mother, had 12 girls before she had a boy.
(Laughter) So you know how I came out.
(Laughter) Now, she had 14 children.
She raised 11 of us out of that 14, and up until last year, we were all still living, a bunch of old biddies, but we're still here.
(Laughter) And sometimes we can be just cantankerous and blah blah blah blah blah, but we still go.
And I love to see women.
You don't know what it does for me to see women in the position that you're in today.
I never thought I'd see that.
I never thought I'd see women be able to take places and positions that we have today.
It is just a powerful thing.
I had a young woman come to me.
She was an African-American woman.
And I said, "Well, what do you do, honey?"
She said, "I am a retired Navy pilot."
Oh God, that just melted me, because I knew how hard it was to integrate that Navy.
You know, the Navy was the last thing to really be integrated, and that was done by Franklin Roosevelt as a favor to an African-American man, Lester Granger, that I knew very well.
He was the head of the National Urban League back there, and when Roosevelt asked him, he wanted to appoint Lester as maybe one of his cabinet members.
Lester said, "No, I don't want that.
All I want you to do is integrate that Navy."
And that was what Franklin did.
Well, Franklin didn't live to do it, but Truman did it.
But when this woman told me, "I have flown everything there is to fly," bombers, just all kinds of planes, it just melted me, you know, just to see how far women have come.
And I told her, I said, "Well, you could get into the space program."
She said, "But Ms. Chase, I'm too old."
She was already 60-some years old, and, you know, you're over the hill then.
(Laughter) They don't want you flying up in the sky at 60-something years old.
Stay on the ground.
When I meet women, and today everybody comes to my kitchen, and you know that, and it upsets Stella, my daughter.
She doesn't like people coming in the kitchen.
But that's where I am, and that's where you're going to see me, in the kitchen.
So when they come there, I meet all kinds of people.
And that is the thing that really uplifts me, is when I meet women on the move.
When I meet women on the move, it is good for me.
Now, I'm not one of these flag-waving women.
You're not going to see me out there waving.
No, I don't do that.
(Laughter) No, I don't do that, and I don't want any of you to do that.
Just be good women.
And you know, my mother taught us ...
she was tough on us, and she said, "You know, Leah," she gave us all this plaque, "to be a good woman, you have to first look like a girl."
Well, I thought I looked like a girl.
"Act like a lady."
That, I never learned to do.
(Laughter) "Think like a man."
Now don't act like that man; think like a man.
And "work like a dog."
(Laughter) So we learned that the hard way.
And they taught you that.
They taught you what women had to do.
We were taught that women controlled the behavior of men.
How you act, they will act.
So you've got to do that, and I tell you all the time.
You know, don't play this man down.
It upsets me when you may have a husband that maybe he doesn't have as much education under his belt as you have, but still you can't play him down.
You've got to keep lifting him up, because you don't want to live with a mouse.
So you want that man to be a man, and do what he has to do.
And anyway, always remember, he runs on cheap gas.
(Laughter) So fill him up with cheap gas -- (Laughter) and then, you got him.
It's just so -- (Laughter) It's just -- PM: You have to give us a minute to take that in.
(Laughter) LC: When I heard this young lady speak before I came out -- she was so beautiful, and I wished I could be like that, and my husband, poor darling -- I lost him after we were married 70 years -- didn't agree on one thing, never did, nothing, but we got along together because he learned to understand me, and that was just hard, because he was so different.
And that lady reminded me.
I said, "If I would have just been like her, Dooky would have really loved it."
(Laughter) But I wasn't.
I was always pushy, always moving, always doing this, and he used to come to me all the time, and he said, "Honey, God's going to punish you."
(Laughter) "You -- you're just not grateful."
But it isn't that I'm not grateful, but I think, as long as you're living, you've got to keep moving, you've got to keep trying to get up and do what you've got to do.
(Applause) You cannot sit down.
You have to keep going, keep trying to do a little bit every day.
Every day, you do a little bit, try to make it better.
And that's been my whole life.
Well, I came up in the country, small town, had to do everything, had to haul the water, had to wash the clothes, do this, do that, pick the dumb strawberries, all that kind of stuff.
(Laughter) But still, my daddy insisted that we act nice, we be kind.
And that's all.
When I heard this young woman -- oh, she sounds so beautiful -- I said, "I wish I could be like that."
PM: Mrs. Chase, we don't want you to be any different than you are.
There is no question about that.
Let me ask you.
This is why it's so wonderful to have a conversation with someone who has such a long view -- LC: A long time.
PM: to remembering Roosevelt and the person he did that favor for.
What is in your head and your mind and what you have seen and witnessed ...
One of the things that it's good to remember, always, is that when you opened that restaurant, whites and blacks could not eat together in this city.
It was against the law.
And yet they did, at Dooky Chase. Tell me about that.
LC: They did, there.
Well, my mother-in-law first started this, and the reason she started is, because her husband was sickly, and he would go out -- and people from Chicago and all the places, you would call his job a numbers runner.
But in New Orleans, we are very sophisticated -- (Laughter) so it wasn't a numbers runner, it was a lottery vendor.
(Laughter) So you see, we put class to that.
But that's how he did it.
And he couldn't go from house to house to get his clients and all that, because he was sick, so she opened up this little sandwich shop, so she was going to take down the numbers, because he was sick a lot.
He had ulcers. He was really bad for a long a time.
So she did that -- and not knowing anything, but she knew she could make a sandwich.
She knew she could cook, and she borrowed 600 dollars from a brewery.
Can you imagine starting a business today with 600 dollars and no knowledge of what you're doing?
And it always just amazed me what she could do.
She was a good money manager.
That, I am not.
My husband used to call me a bankrupt sister.
(Laughter) "She'll spend everything you got."
And I would, you know.
PM: But you kept the restaurant open, though, even in those times of controversy, when people were protesting and almost boycotting.
I mean, it was a controversial move that you and your husband made.
LC: It was, and I don't know how we did it, but as I said, my mother-in-law was a kind, kind person, and you didn't have any African-Americans on the police force at that time.
They were all white.
But they would come around, and she would say, "Bebe, I'm gonna fix you a little sandwich."
So she would fix them a sandwich.
Today they would call that bribery.
(Laughter) But she was just that kind of person.
She liked to do things for you.
She liked to give.
So she would do that, and maybe that helped us out, because nobody ever bothered us.
We had Jim Dombrowski, Albert Ben Smith, who started all kinds of things right in that restaurant, and nobody ever bothered us.
So we just did it.
PM: Excuse me.
You talked to me that day about the fact that people considered the restaurant a safe haven where they could come together, particularly if they were working on civil rights, human rights, working to change the laws.
LC: Well, because once you got inside those doors, nobody ever, ever bothered you.
The police would never come in and bother our customers, never.
So they felt safe to come there.
They could eat, they could plan.
All the Freedom Riders, that's where they planned all their meetings.
They would come and we would serve them a bowl of gumbo and fried chicken.
(Laughter) So I said, we'd changed the course of America over a bowl of gumbo and some fried chicken.
(Applause) I would like to invite the leaders, now, just come have a bowl of gumbo and some fried chicken, talk it over and we'd go and we'd do what we have to do.
(Applause) And that's all we did.
PM: Could we send you a list to invite to lunch?
(Laughter) LC: Yeah, invite.
Because that's what we're not doing.
We're not talking.
Come together.
I don't care if you're a Republican or what you are -- come together.
Talk.
And I know those old guys.
I was friends with those old guys, like Tip O'Neill and all of those people.
They knew how to come together and talk, and you would disagree maybe.
That's OK.
But you would talk, and we would come to a good thing and meet.
And so that's what we did in that restaurant.
They would plan the meeting, Oretha's mother, Oretha Haley's mother.
She was big in CORE.
Her mother worked for me for 42 years.
And she was like me.
We didn't understand the program.
Nobody our age understood this program, and we sure didn't want our children to go to jail.
Oh, that was ... oh God.
But these young people were willing to go to jail for what they believed.
We were working with Thurgood and A.P. Tureaud and all those people with the NAACP.
But that was a slow move.
We would still be out here trying to get in the door, waiting for them.
(Laughter) PM: Is that Thurgood Marshall you're talking about?
LC: Thurgood Marshall. But I loved Thurgood.
He was a good movement.
They wanted to do this without offending anybody.
I'll never forget A.P. Tureaud: "But you can't offend the white people.
Don't offend them."
But these young people didn't care.
They said, "We're going. Ready or not, we're going to do this."
And so we had to support them.
These were the children we knew, righteous children.
We had to help them.
PM: And they brought the change. LC: And they brought the change.
You know, it was hard, but sometimes you do hard things to make changes.
PM: And you've seen so many of those changes.
The restaurant has been a bridge.
You have been a bridge between the past and now, but you don't live in the past, do you?
You live very much in the present.
LC: And that's what you have to tell young people today.
OK, you can protest, but put the past behind you.
I can't make you responsible for what your grandfather did.
That's your grandfather.
I have to build on that.
I have to make changes.
I can't stay there and say, "Oh, well, look what they did to us then.
Look what they do to us now."
No, you remember that, but that makes you keep going on, but you don't harp on it every day.
You move, and you move to make a difference, and everybody should be involved.
My children said, "Mother, don't get political," you know.
(Laughter) "Don't get political, because you know we don't like that."
But you have to be political today.
You have to be involved.
Be a part of the system.
Look how it was when we couldn't be a part of the system.
When Dutch Morial became the mayor, it was a different feeling in the African-American community.
We felt a part of things.
Now we've got a mayor.
We feel like we belong.
Moon tried before Dutch came.
PM: Mayor Landrieu's father, Moon Landrieu.
LC: Mayor Landrieu's father, he took great, great risks by putting African-Americans in city hall.
He took a whipping for that for a long time, but he was a visionary, and he did those things that he knew was going to help the city.
He knew we had to get involved.
So that's what we have to do.
We don't harp on that.
We just keep moving, and Mitch, you know, I tell Moon all the time, "You did a good thing," but Mitch did one bigger than you and better than you.
When he pulled those statues down, I said, "Boy, you're crazy!"
(Applause) You're crazy.
But it was a good political move.
You know, when I saw P.T. Beauregard come down, I was sitting looking at the news, and it just hit me what this was all about.
To me, it wasn't about race; it was a political move.
And I got so furious, I got back on that kitchen the next morning, and I said, come on, pick up your pants, and let's go to work, because you're going to get left behind.
And that's what you have to do.
You have to move on people, move on what they do.
It was going to bring visibility to the city.
So you got that visibility -- move on it, uplift yourself, do what you have to do, and do it well.
And that's all we do.
That's all I try to do.
PM: But you just gave the formula for resilience. Right?
So you are clearly the best example we could find anywhere of resilience, so there must be something you think -- LC: I like emotional strength.
I like people with emotional and physical strength, and maybe that's bad for me.
My favorite all-time general was George Patton.
You know, that wasn't too cool.
(Laughter) PM: It's surprising.
LC: I've got George Patton hanging in my dining room because I want to remember.
He set goals for himself, and he was going to set out to reach those goals.
He never stopped.
And I always remember his words: "Lead, follow, or get out of the way."
Now, I can't lead -- (Applause) I can't be a leader, but I can follow a good leader, but I am not getting out of the way.
(Applause) But that's just what you have to do.
(Applause) If you can't lead -- leaders need followers, so if I help you up there, I'm going to ride on your coattails, and I can't count the coattails I've ridden upon.
(Laughter) Feed you good. You'll help me out.
(Laughter) And that's what life is all about.
Everybody can do something, but please get involved.
Do something.
The thing we have to do in this city, in all cities -- mommas have to start being mommas today.
You know?
They have to start understanding -- when you bring this child in the world, you have to make a man out of it, you have to make a woman out of it, and it takes some doing.
It takes sacrifice.
Maybe you won't have the long fingernails, maybe you won't have the pretty hair.
But that child will be on the move, and that's what you have to do.
We have to concentrate on educating and making these children understand what it's all about.
And I hate to tell you, gentlemen, it's going to take a good woman to do that.
It's going to take a good woman to do that.
(Applause) Men can do their part.
The other part is to just do what you have to do and bring it home, but we can handle the rest, and we will handle the rest.
If you're a good woman, you can do that.
PM: You heard that first here.
We can handle the rest.
LC: We can handle the rest.
Mrs. Chase, thank you so much -- LC: Thank you.
PM: for taking time out from the work you do every day in this community.
LC: But you don't know what this does for me.
When I see all of these people, and come together -- people come to my kitchen from all over the world.
I had people come from London, now twice this happened to me.
First a man came, and I don't know why he came to this -- Every year, the chefs do something called "Chef's Charity."
Well, it so happened I was the only woman there, and the only African-American there on that stage doing these demonstrations, and I would not leave until I saw another woman come up there, too.
I'm not going up -- they're going to carry me up there until you bring another woman up here.
(Laughter) So they have another one now, so I could step down.
But this man was from London.
So after that, I found the man in my kitchen.
He came to my kitchen, and he said, "I want to ask you one question."
OK, I thought I was going to ask something about food.
"Why do all these white men hang around you?"
(Laughter) What?
(Laughter) I couldn't understand.
He couldn't understand that.
I said, "We work together.
This is the way we live in this city.
I may never go to your house, you may never come to my house.
But when it comes to working, like raising money for this special school, we come together.
That's what we do.
And still here comes another, a woman, elegantly dressed, about a month ago in my kitchen.
She said, "I don't understand what I see in your dining room."
I said, "What do you see?"
She saw whites and blacks together.
That's what we do.
We meet. We talk.
And we work together, and that's what we have to do.
You don't have to be my best friend to work to better your city, to better your country.
We just have to come together and work, and that's what we do in this city.
We're a weird bunch down here.
(Laughter) Nobody understands us, but we feed you well.
(Laughter) (Applause) (Cheering) Thank you.
(Applause)
We are all trapped inside our own heads, and our beliefs and our understandings about the world are limited by that perspective, which means we tell ourselves stories.
Right? So here we are in this infinite data source.
There's an infinite number of things that we could think about, but we edit and delete.
We choose what to think about, what to pay attention to.
We make up a story ...
to make sense of what's going on, and we all get it wrong.
Because we're all trying to navigate with our own skewed compasses, and we all have our own baggage, but the stories themselves are utterly convincing.
And we all do this, and a lot of the stories that we live by aren't even our own.
The first ones we inherit at a young age from our parents, who of course have their own skewed beliefs, their own frustrations, their own unlived lives.
And for better or worse, we take all that onboard, and then we go out into the world thinking maybe we have to be successful to be loved; or that we always have to put other people's needs first; or that we have some big terrible secret we couldn't possible tell people.
And it's just fiction, it's just stories, and we'd worry a lot less about what other people think of us if we realized how seldom they do.
(Laughter) So I feel that magic is a great analogy for how we edit reality and form a story and then mistake that story for the truth, and I've had a 20-year career in the UK staging big psychological experiments on TV, and now that's on Netflix.
I also have a stage show.
I've got my first Broadway show actually coming up, called "Secret."
Just throwing that out there. No pressure.
(Laughter) That should be this year.
And I try to do something new with mentalism, mentalism, which is the dubious art of getting inside your head.
So there was a heyday for this kind of stage mind-reading, which was the 1930s.
That's why I'm dressed like this, in my most un-TED-like garb.
And there was an act, an act known as the Oracle Act.
And in the Oracle Act, members of the audience, as I know you have done, would write down secret questions, the sort of questions you might ask a psychic, seal that question into an envelope, and on the outside of the envelope they would write their initials and then roughly where they sat in the audience.
And then the Oracle, the mind reader, would take an envelope one at a time, he wouldn't open it, but he would attempt to divine what question was sealed inside.
And if he got that right, he would try and answer the question for the person too.
And the act spread like wildfire.
It's a testament, I think, to the seductive appeal of some powerful figure offering you easy, simple answers to life's complex and subtle questions and anxieties.
So thank you all of you that wrote questions.
I haven't seen these. I know somebody's guarding them.
Thank you so much.
I will take those now. Thank you all of you that did this.
I should say, probably, a couple of things before I start.
In absolute honesty, first of all I can't see through these envelopes.
They are sealed. They are thick black envelopes.
You'll know if you wrote one. I can't see through them.
Secondly, importantly, I don't know any of you and nobody is playing along.
That's not what this is.
Thirdly ...
I don't believe for a second that I have any special psychological gifts, let alone any psychic ones.
So let's begin.
Nope.
(Laughter) OK, this -- Oh, nice.
OK, this one's interesting. There's a couple here.
I will start with maybe this one.
This one's interesting, because the writing undulates.
There's a sort of an up and down thing, which normally -- not always -- normally means that the person doesn't know the answer to the question themselves, so it's normally a question about the future, right?
That sort of suggests uncertainty.
So I would say it's a lady, age-wise it's a little difficult to tell from this minimal handwriting, but I would expect maybe 30s, maybe 40s, but let's find out.
It says -- and a question about the future -- it says, "JN, center."
So it's going to be somebody in this big central section here.
If you think this is you, if you wrote one, could you make a fuss?
It's a bit difficult for me to see in the center.
Hi, give us a wave.
So J ...
Jane? Jessica?
Jessica: Yes.
Derren Brown: Which one? Jessica: Jessica.
DB: Thank you. Just a guess. Little murmur of approval, thank you?
(Laughter) I'll take it.
Alright, so Jessica, I won't ask your age, but is it a question essentially about the future?
Jessica: Mhm? DB: Yes?
Jessica: Yes. DB: Yes. OK.
Alright. So what did we ask? What did Jessica ask about the future?
So am I OK with late-30s, early-40s?
Jessica: I'll take it. I'm taking it.
(Laughter) DB: OK, so it's important, because we ask different questions depending how old we are.
Just say, "I'll take it" again.
Jessica: I'll take it.
DB: Virginia? You're from Virginia? Jessica: Yes, I am.
DB: Yeah. So -- (Laughter) I think this is a lady, I think this is a lady who wants to leave Virginia.
I think you're looking at plans, it's whether or not things are going to come together to get out.
Just show me your hands.
Other sides so I can see fingernails?
OK, I think you have a farm and it's whether or not you're going to sell your farm and get out of Virginia?
Is this right?
Jessica: Absolutely, that's the question.
DB: Alright. Great. Thank you. It's a great question!
What was the actual question? What did you put?
Jessica: "Will I sell the farm in Virginia?"
DB: Will you sell the farm?
Alright, so look, it's a great question if you are pretending to be psychic, because it's about the future, which means I can give you a yes or no on this.
It means nothing. You have no way of verifying it.
And a dangerous thing to do -- and if I say yes or no, it'll just stick in the back of your mind, and it can't not start to affect decisions you make.
So a dangerous thing to do. However -- (Laughter) Yes, I think you will sell the farm, because I think you're the sort of person that in the nicest way will get what you want.
I think when there are things you want, you tend to focus on them at the expense of other things that you know you probably should be focusing on more, would you agree?
Educated, you spent a few years in -- Say yes again, the word "yes" quickly? Jessica: Yes.
DB: No? Jessica: No.
DB: California? Berkeley? A bit of a guess, but ...
Jessica: I went to Berkeley, yes. Stop doing this!
DB: So it's a yes.
Oh, and you've been to India recently as well.
There's just a tiny, tiny little thing going on there. Yes? No?
Jessica: Yes, I just got back from India.
DB: It's a yes from me, I just don't want to say it like it's written in the stars because it isn't, and you need to take responsibility for it.
DB: Have a seat. Thank you. Let's do another one.
(Applause) AH, also in the center? AH.
This will be a man, a little older, maybe late 40s, I would say from this.
AH, center, stand up for me if you think this is you.
AH. Hi, let's get a microphone to this guy.
Quick as we can, on camera would be amazing.
Oh, look at that! Freeze. Don't move. Don't move.
Keep absolutely still.
Are you standing? Where are you?
Man: I am standing. I'm not that short.
DB: OK.
Alright, now you changed that.
There was just something you did as you got up.
Yes or no, have you put something on here -- you're not doing it now, but you did it as you stood up -- to do with your left or your left leg or your left foot, yes or no?
Man: Yes.
DB: Alright. He was giving us a nice clear signal as he stood up.
Put your weight on your left-hand side and say "yes."
Man: Yes.
DB: Take your hand out of that pocket, put your weight on the other side, change hands with the mic and say "yes" again.
DB: You have a dislocation in the big toe on your left-hand side?
Man: Yes.
DB: Thank you so much. Great. Good one! Take a seat. Take a seat.
Can I get the microphone? I'm going to change microphone for this.
Can I grab a mic up? Thank you.
Thank you so much. That would be great there.
I'm going to change mic because, hopefully you can now still hear me?
So I'm going to blindfold myself.
And I'm doing this now so I don't have the clues as you stand up.
I can't see where you put your hands.
I can't see how you respond to what I'm saying.
I can't see what the people next to you are doing either.
If they know the answers to the question, that's always very helpful.
I won't have those advantages, but strangely, this frees me up, and I want this to free you up as well, so if you didn't write a question but you wish that you had done, you can still take part.
The point of writing the question is only that it just kind of gets a nice, clear, succinct wording in your head.
So if you can just find a question in your head, make it clear and succinct, just send it to me, and I'll try and do this now without anything written down.
So just start to form questions but send me your name as well.
"My name is," whatever that last guy was, and "what's strange about my feet," or whatever the question was.
So name and question.
There is somebody already, I'm guessing you're quite near the front, because your name is quite clear.
Feels like you're in the center at the front.
OK, let me just ... Allan?
Feels like there's an Allan.
And you're going to be quite near the front, vaguely central, I think.
Feels like it's coming from right there.
There's like a man, maybe early 60s, something like that.
Allan: Yes.
DB: You've got a mic? Great, thank you.
Allan, just say "stop" when I get to you so that I know where you are, where to face.
Allan: Stop.
DB: You a Capricorn? Allan: Yes.
DB: So Allan has something in his head.
Now, did you hear it, hear the reserve in his voice?
It's going to be something really tricky.
I think with you ... Just say "yes" again for me?
Allan: Yes.
DB: It's going to be either -- no it's not.
It's access, it's a password or access to something.
Have you got something, just yes or no, with a password in your head?
Allan: Yes.
DB: A computer password, that sort of thing?
Allan: Yes.
DB: Excellent!
(Laughter) In that case, I'm going to finish on this one. Let me --- If I get this right, they're all going to know what it is, and millions of people potentially.
You will change it, won't you?
Allan: Of course.
(Laughter) DB: Just say "of course" again? Allan: Of course.
DB: Alright. If it's a word -- I imagine it's a word, right -- just see the password written in front of you, big clear block capital letters, and as you look at it, think for me of a letter somewhere in the middle, don't say it out loud, just get a letter in your head that's in the middle.
Have you got one? Allan: Yeah.
DB: OK, stick with that for me.
Ah, you changed it, OK.
You changed your mind there.
I think you settled on a -- I think that's a "B", yes?
Allan: No.
I didn't.
DB: Then it's an "I"? Allan: Correct.
DB: But you had a B. Allan: Yes.
DB: Yeah, he changed his mind. He changed his mind.
(Laughter) So see it written there.
Just keep saying it to yourself in your head.
Oh, you play drums, don't you.
Allan: I do.
DB: Just get that out of your head, get that out of your head, just focus on this one thing for me.
(Laughter) My job is to sell you a story, right?
I try and do this to all of you, to get you to pay attention to one thing that I want you to find important, ignore other things that I want you to ignore, and then join up those narrative dots to tell yourself a certain story about what I'm doing, and this only works because we are story-forming creatures, which means we do this every day.
We go out into this complex and subtle world full of a complex and subtle people like you and me, Allan, and we reduce them to these neat characters that fit whatever story we're telling ourselves, and we say, "She's insecure," "He's arrogant," "They can't be trusted."
And these are just stories like the story that I can somehow read your mind.
You're thinking of selling your company as well, aren't you, at the moment.
Allan: Correct.
DB: Which is something to do with skin?
Allan: Yes.
DB: Skin care or something like this.
Allan: Uh, yes.
DB: And I think the reason why I love doing this is that it reminds me at least to try and be more alive and alert to the complexity and the subtlety of what's real, that there's always other stuff going on that we don't know about, and it means we can get less stuck, we can be kinder to people because we can recognize there's always fear behind their stress, so we don't need to meet it as defensively, and we can start to see the stories for what they are and recognize that life isn't all about us.
Oh!
Your password, where are you? Where are you? Where is he?
Allan: Right here.
DB: Stand up for me. Your password is "ariboy."
A-r-i-b-o-y? Is that right? Allan: That's correct.
DB: Then thank you so much. Thank you very much indeed.
(Applause)
(Music) (Music ends) (Applause) (Applause ends) Hi, everyone. I'm Sirena.
I'm 11 years old and from Connecticut.
(Audience cheers) (Applause) Well, I'm not really sure why I'm here.
(Laughter) I mean, what does this have to do with technology, entertainment and design?
Well, I count my iPod, cellphone and computer as technology, but this has nothing to do with that.
So I did a little research on it.
Well, this is what I found.
Of course, I hope I can memorize it.
(Clears throat) The violin is made of a wood box and four metal strings.
By pulling a string, it vibrates and produces a sound wave, which passes through a piece of wood called a bridge, and goes down to the wood box and gets amplified, but ... let me think.
(Laughter) Placing your finger at different places on the fingerboard changes the string length, and that changes the frequency of the sound wave.
(Sighs) Oh, my gosh!
(Laughter) OK, this is sort of technology, but I can call it a 16th-century technology.
But actually, the most fascinating thing that I found was that even the audio system or wave transmission nowadays are still based on the same principle of producing and projecting sound.
Isn't that cool?
(Laughter) (Applause) Design -- I love its design.
I remember when I was little, my mom asked me, "Would you like to play the violin or the piano?"
I looked at that giant monster and said to myself -- "I am not going to lock myself on that bench the whole day!"
(Laughter) This is small and lightweight.
I can play from standing, sitting or walking.
And, you know what?
The best of all is that if I don't want to practice, (Whispering) I can hide it.
(Laughter) The violin is very beautiful.
Some people relate it as the shape of a lady.
But whether you like it or not, it's been so for more than 400 years, unlike modern stuff [that] easily looks dated.
But I think it's very personal and unique that, although each violin looks pretty similar, no two violins sound the same -- even from the same maker or based on the same model.
Entertainment -- I love the entertainment.
But actually, the instrument itself isn't very entertaining.
I mean, when I first got my violin and tried to play around on it, it was actually really bad, because it didn't sound the way I'd heard from other kids -- it was so horrible and so scratchy.
So, it wasn't entertaining at all.
But besides, my brother found this very funny: Yuk! Yuk! Yuk!
(Laughter) A few years later, I heard a joke about the greatest violinist, Jascha Heifetz.
After Mr. Heifetz's concert, a lady came over and complimented him: "Oh, Mr. Heifetz, your violin sounded so great tonight!"
And Mr. Heifetz was a very cool person, so he picked up his violin and said, "Funny -- I don't hear anything."
(Laughter) Now I realize that as the musician, we human beings, with our great mind, artistic heart and skill, can change this 16th-century technology and a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment.
Now I know why I'm here.
(Music) (Music ends) (Applause) At first, I thought I was just going to be here to perform, but unexpectedly, I learned and enjoyed much more.
But ... although some of the talks were quite up there for me.
(Laughter) Like the multi-dimension stuff.
I mean, honestly, I'd be happy enough if I could actually get my two dimensions correct in school.
(Laughter) But actually, the most impressive thing to me is that -- well, actually, I would also like to say this for all children is to say thank you to all adults, for actually caring for us a lot, and to make our future world much better.
Thank you.

Right when I was 15 was when I first got interested in solar energy.
My family had moved from Fort Lee, New Jersey to California, from the snow to lots of heat, and gas lines.
There was gas rationing in 1973.
The energy crisis was in full bore.
I started reading "Popular Science" magazine, and I got really excited about the potential of solar energy to try and solve that crisis.
I had just taken trigonometry in high school, I learned about the parabola and how it could concentrate rays of light to a single focus.
That got me very excited.
And I really felt that there would be potential to build some kind of thing that could concentrate light.
And this was a company where I built parabolas, I took metal shop, and I remember walking into metal shop building parabolas and Stirling engines.
And I was building a Stirling engine over on the lathe, and all the motorcycle guys said, "You're building a bong, aren't you?"
And I said, "No, it's a Stirling engine." But they didn't believe me.
I sold the plans for this engine and for this dish in the back of "Popular Science" magazine, for four dollars each.
It was a really big excitement for me to get into Caltech.
And at my first year at Caltech, I continued the business.
But then, in the second year of Caltech, they started grading.
The whole first year was pass/fail, but the second year was graded.
I wasn't able to keep up with the business, and I ended up with a 25-year detour.
My dream had been to convert solar energy at a very practical cost, but then I had this big detour.
Then, when I graduated from Caltech, the IBM PC came out, and I got addicted to the IBM PC in 1981.
And then in 1983, Lotus 1-2-3 came out, and I was completely blown away by Lotus 1-2-3.
I began operating my business with 1-2-3, began writing add-ins for 1-2-3, wrote a natural language interface to 1-2-3.
I started an educational software company after I joined Lotus, and then I started Idealab so I could have a roof under which I could build multiple companies in succession.
Much later -- in 2000, very recently -- the new California energy crisis -- what was purported to be a big energy crisis -- was coming.
And I was trying to figure out if we could build something that would capitalize on that and get people backup energy, in case the crisis really came.
And I started looking at how we could build battery backup systems that could give people five hours, 10 hours, maybe even a full day, or three days' worth of backup power.
I'm glad you heard earlier today, batteries are unbelievably -- lack density compared to fuel.
So much more energy can be stored with fuel than with batteries.
You'd have to fill your entire parking space of one garage space just to give yourself four hours of battery backup.
And I concluded, after researching every other technology that we could deploy for storing energy -- flywheels, different formulations of batteries -- it just wasn't practical to store energy.
So what about making energy? Maybe we could make energy.
I tried to figure out -- maybe solar's become attractive.
It's been 25 years since I was doing this, let me go back and look at what's been happening with solar cells.
And the price had gone down from 10 dollars a watt to about four or five dollars a watt, but it stabilized.
And it needed to get much lower to be cost-effective.
I studied all the new things that had happened in solar cells, and was looking for ways we could make solar cells more inexpensively.
A lot of new things are happening to do that, but fundamentally, the process requires a tremendous amount of energy.
Some people say it takes more energy to make a solar cell than it will give out in its entire life.
If we reduce the amount of energy it takes to make the cells, that will become more practical.
But right now, you pretty much have to take silicon, put it in an oven at 1600 F for 17 hours, to make the cells.
A lot of people are working to try and reduce that, but I didn't have anything to contribute.
So I tried to figure out what other way could we try to make cost-effective solar electricity.
What if we collect the sun with a large reflector -- like I had been thinking about in high school, but maybe with modern technology we could make it cheaper -- concentrate it to a small converter, and then the conversion device wouldn't have to be as expensive, because it's much smaller, rather than solar cells, which have to cover the entire surface that you want to gather sun from.
This seemed practical now, because a lot of new technologies had come in the 25 years since I had last looked at it.
There was a lot of new manufacturing techniques, not to mention really cheap miniature motors -- brushless motors, servomotors, stepper motors, that are used in printers and scanners.
Of course, inexpensive microprocessors and a very important breakthrough -- genetic algorithms.
I'll be very short on genetic algorithms.
You take a problem that you can't solve with a pure mathematical answer, you build an evolutionary system to try multiple tries at guessing, you add sex -- where you take half of one solution and half of another and then make new mutations -- and you use natural selection to kill off not-as-good solutions.
Usually, with a genetic algorithm on a computer today, with a three gigahertz processor, you can solve many formerly intractable problems in just a matter of minutes.
So we tried to come up with a way to use genetic algorithms to create a new type of concentrator.
And I'll show you what we came up with.
Traditionally, concentrators look like this.
Those shapes are parabolas.
They take all the parallel incoming rays and focus it to a single spot.
They have to track the sun, because they have to point directly at the sun.
They usually have a one degree acceptance angle -- once they're more than a degree off, none of the sunlight rays will hit the focus.
So we tried to come up with a non-tracking collector that would gather much more than one degree of light, with no moving parts.
So we created a genetic algorithm to try this out, we made a model in Excel of a multisurface reflector, and an amazing thing evolved, literally, from trying a billion cycles, a billion different attempts, with a fitness function that defined how can you collect the most light, from the most angles, over a day, from the sun.
And this is the shape that evolved.
It's this non-tracking collector with these six tuba-like horns, and each of them collect light in the following way -- if the sunlight strikes right here, it might bounce right to the center, the hot spot, directly, but if the sun is off axis and comes from the side, it might hit two places and take two bounces.
So for direct light, it takes only one bounce, for off-axis light it might take two, and for extreme off-axis, it might take three.
Your efficiency goes down with more bounces, because you lose about 10 percent with each bounce, but this allowed us to collect light from a plus or minus 25-degree angle.
So, about two and a half hours of the day we could collect with a stationary component.
Solar cells collect light for four and a half hours though.
On an average adjusted day, a solar cell -- because the sun's moving across the sky, the solar cell is going down with a sine wave function of performance at the off-axis angles.
It collects about four and a half average hours of sunlight a day.
So even this, although it was great with no moving parts -- we could achieve high temperatures -- wasn't enough.
We needed to beat solar cells.
We looked at a way to break up a parabola into individual petals that would track.
So what you see here is 12 separate petals that each could be controlled with individual microprocessors that would only cost a dollar.
You can buy a two-megahertz microprocessor for a dollar now.
And you can buy stepper motors that pretty much never wear out because they have no brushes, for a dollar.
So we can control all 12 of these petals for under 50 dollars and what this would allow us to do is not have to move the focus any more, but only move the petals.
The whole system would have a much lower profile, but also we could gather sunlight for six and a half to seven hours a day.
Now that we have concentrated sunlight, what are we going to put at the center to convert sunlight to electricity?
So we tried to look at all the different heat engines that have been used in history to convert sunlight or heat to electricity, And one of the great ones of all time, James Watt's steam engine of 1788 was a major breakthrough.
James Watt didn't actually invent the steam engine, he just refined it.
But his refinements were incredible.
He added new linear motion guides to the pistons, he added a condenser to cool the steam outside the cylinder, he made the engine double-acting, so it had double the power.
Those were major breakthroughs. All of the improvements he made -- and it's justifiable that our measure of energy, the watt, today is named after him.
So we looked at this engine, and this had some potential.
Steam engines are dangerous, and they had tremendous impact on the world -- industrial revolution and ships and locomotives.
But they're usually good to be large, so they're not good for distributed power generation.
Another type of engine is the hot air engine.
And the hot air engine also was not invented by Robert Stirling, but Robert Stirling came along in 1816 and radically improved it.
This engine, because it was so interesting -- it only worked on air, no steam -- has led to hundreds of creative designs over the years that use the Stirling engine principle.
But after the Stirling engine, Otto came along, and also, he didn't invent the internal combustion engine, he just refined it.
He showed it in Paris in 1867, and it was a major achievement because it brought the power density of the engine way up.
You could now get a lot more power in a lot smaller space, and that allowed the engine to be used for mobile applications.
So, once you have mobility, you're making a lot of engines because you've got lots of units, as opposed to steam ships or big factories, so this was the engine that ended up benefiting from mass production where all the other engines didn't.
So, because it went into mass production, costs were reduced, 100 years of refinement, emissions were reduced, tremendous production value.
There have been hundreds of millions of internal combustion engines built, compared to thousands of Stirling engines built.
And not nearly as many small steam engines being built anymore, only large ones for big operations.
So after looking at these three, and 47 others, we concluded that the Stirling engine would be the best one to use.
I want to give you a brief explanation of how we looked at it and how it works.
So we tried to look at the Stirling engine in a new way, because it was practical -- weight no longer mattered for our application.
The internal combustion engine took off because weight mattered, because you were moving around.
But if you're trying to generate solar energy in a static place the weight doesn't matter so much.
We also discovered that efficiency doesn't matter so much if your energy source is free.
Normally, efficiency is crucial because the fuel cost of your engine over its life dwarfs the cost of the engine.
But if your fuel source is free, then the only thing that matters is the up-front capital cost of the engine.
So you don't want to optimize for efficiency, you want to optimize for power per dollar.
So using that new twist, with the new criteria, we thought we could relook at the Stirling engine, and also bring genetic algorithms in.
Basically, Robert Stirling didn't have Gordon Moore before him to get us three gigahertz of processor power.
So we took the same genetic algorithm that we used earlier to make that concentrator, which didn't work out for us, to optimize the Stirling engine, and make its design sizes and all of its dimensions the exact optimum to get the most power per dollar, irrespective of weight, irrespective of size, just to get the most conversion of solar energy, because the sun is free.
The simplest heat engine, or hot air engine, of all time would be this -- take a box, a steel canister, with a piston.
Put a flame under it, the piston moves up.
Take it off the flame and pour water on it, or let it cool down, the piston moves down.
That's the most fundamental heat engine you could have.
The problem is the efficiency is one hundredth of one percent, because you're heating all the metal of the chamber and then cooling all the metal of the chamber each time.
And you're only getting power from the air that's heating at the same time, but you're wasting energy heating and cooling the metal.
So someone came up with a very clever idea.
Instead of heating and cooling the whole cylinder, what about if you put a displacer inside -- a little thing that shuttles the air back and forth.
You move that up and down with a little bit of energy but now you're only shifting the air down to the hot end and up to the cold end.
So, now you're not alternately heating and cooling the metal, just the air.
That allows you to get the efficiency up from a hundredth of a percent to about two percent.
And then Robert Stirling came along with this genius idea, which was, well, I'm still not heating the metal now, with this kind of engine, but I'm still reheating all the air.
I'm still heating the air every time and cooling the air every time.
What about if I put a thermal sponge in the middle, in the passageway between where the air has to move between hot and cold?
So he made fine wires, and cracked glass, and all different kinds of materials to be a heat sponge.
So when the air pushes up to go from the hot end to the cold end, it puts some heat into the sponge.
And then when the air comes back after it's been cooled, it picks up that heat again.
So you're reusing your energy five or six times, and that brings the efficiency up to between 30 and 40 percent.
It's a little known, but brilliant, genius invention of Robert Stirling that takes the hot air engine from being somewhat impractical -- like I found out when I made the real simple version in high school -- to very potentially possible, once you get the efficiency up, if you can design this to be low enough cost.
So we really set out on a path to try and make the lowest cost possible.
We built a huge mathematical model of how a Stirling engine works.
We applied the genetic algorithm.
We built engines -- so we built 100 different engines over the last two years.
We measured each one, we readjusted the model to what we measured, and then we led that to the current prototype.
It led to a very compact, inexpensive engine, and this is what the engine looks like.
Let me show you what it looks like in real life.
So this is the engine. It's just a small cylinder down here, which holds the generator inside and all the linkage, and it's the hot cap -- the hot cylinder on the top -- this part gets hot, this part is cool, and electricity comes out.
The exact converse is also true.
If you put electricity in, this will get hot and this will get cold, you get refrigeration.
So it's a complete reversible cycle, a very efficient cycle, and quite a simple thing to make.
So now you put the two things together.
What if you combine the petals and the engine in the center?
The petals track and the engine gets the concentrated sunlight, takes that heat and turns it into electricity.
This is what the first prototype of our system looked like with the petals and the engine in the center.
This is being run out in the sun, and now I want to show you what the actual thing looks like.
(Applause) Thank you.
These petals cost about a dollar each -- they're lightweight, injection-molded plastic, aluminized.
The mechanism to control each petal is below there, with a microprocessor on each one.
There are thermocouples on the engine -- little sensors that detect the heat when the sunlight strikes them.
Each petal adjusts itself separately to keep the highest temperature on it.
When the sun comes out in the morning, the petals will seek the sun, find it by searching for the highest temperature.
About a minute and a half or two minutes after the rays are striking the hot cap the engine will be warm enough to start and then the engine will generate electricity for about six and a half hours a day -- six and a half to seven hours as the sun moves across the sky.
A critical part that we can take advantage of is that we have these inexpensive microprocessors and each of these petals is autonomous, and each of these petals figures out where the sun is with no user setup.
So you don't have to tell what latitude, longitude you're at, what your roof slope angle is, or what orientation.
It doesn't really care.
What it does is it searches to find the hottest spot, it searches again a half an hour later, a day later, a month later.
It basically figures out where on Earth you are by watching the direction the sun moves, so you don't have to actually enter anything about that.
The way the unit works is, when the sun comes out, the engine will start and you get power out here.
We have AC and DC, get 12 volts DC, so that could be used for certain applications.
We have an inverter in there, so you get 117 volts AC.
And you also get hot water. The hot water's optional.
You don't have to use it, it will cool itself.
But you can use it to optionally heat hot water and that brings the efficiency up even higher because some of the heat that you'd normally be rejecting, you can now use as useful energy, whether it's for a pool or hot water.
This is the first test where we took it outside and each of the petals were individually seeking.
And what they do is step, very coarsely at first, and very finely afterward.
Once they get a temperature reading on the thermocouple indicating they found the sun, they slow down and do a fine search.
Then the petals will move into position, and the engine will start.
We're very excited about the progress, we have a long way to go though.
This is how we envision it would be in a residential installation: you'd probably have more than one unit on your roof.
You don't have to have enough units to power your entire house, you just save money with each incremental one you add.
So you're still using the grid potentially, in this type of application, to be your backup supply -- of course, you can't use these at night, and you can't use these on cloudy days.
But by reducing your energy use, pretty much at the peak times -- usually when you have your air conditioning on, or other times like that -- this generates the peak power at the peak usage time, so it's very complementary in that sense.
This is how we would envision a residential application.
We also think there's very big potential for energy farms, especially in remote land where there happens to be a lot of sun.
It's a really good combination of those two factors.
It turns out there's a lot of powerful sun all around the world, obviously, but in special places where it happens to be relatively inexpensive to place these and also in many more places where there is high wind power.
So an example of that is, here's the map of the United States.
Pretty much everywhere that's not green or blue is a really ideal place, but even the green or blue areas are good, just not as good as the places that are red, orange and yellow.
But the hot spot right around Las Vegas and Death Valley is very good.
And is only affects the payback period, it doesn't mean that you couldn't use solar energy; you could use it anywhere on Earth.
It just affects the payback period if you're comparing to grid-supplied electricity.
But if you don't have grid-supplied electricity, then the question of payback is a different one entirely.
It's just how many watts do you get per dollar, and how could you benefit from that to change your life in some way.
This is the map of the whole Earth, and you can see a huge swathe in the middle where a large part of the population is, there's tremendous chances for solar energy.
And of course, look at Africa.
The potential to take advantage of solar energy there is unbelievable, and I'm really excited to talk more about finding ways we can help with that.
So, in conclusion, I would say my journey has shown me that you can revisit old ideas in a new light, and sometimes ideas that have been discarded in the past can be practical now if you apply some new technology or new twists.
We believe we're getting very close to something practical and affordable.
Our short-term goal for this is to be half the price of solar cells and our longer-term goal is to be less than a five-year payback.
And at less than a five-year payback, this becomes very economic.
So you don't have to just have a feel-good attitude about energy to want to have one of these.
It just makes economic sense.
Right now, solar paybacks are between 30 and 50 years.
If you get it down below five years, then it's almost a no-brainer because the interest to own it -- someone else will finance it for you and you can just make money from day one.
So that's our real powerful goal that we're really shooting for in the company.
Two other things that I learned that were very surprising to me -- one was how casual we are about energy.
I was walking from the elevator over here, and even just looking at the stage right now -- so there's probably 20,500-watt lights right now.
There's 10,000 watts of light pouring on the stage, one horsepower is 746 watts, at full power.
So there's basically 15 horses running at full speed just to keep the stage lit.
Not to mention the 200 horses that are probably running right now to keep the air-conditioning going.
And it's just amazing, walk in the elevator, and there's lights on in the elevator.
Of course, now I'm very sensitive at home when we leave the lights on by mistake.
But, everywhere around us we have insatiable use for energy because it's so cheap.
And it's cheap because we've been subsidized by energy that's been concentrated by the sun.
It's been pounded for a billion years with a lot of energy to make it have all that energy contained in it.
And we don't have a birthright to just use that up as fast as we are, I think.
And it would be great if we could make our energy usage renewable, where as we're using the energy, we're creating it at the same pace, and I really hope we can get there.
Thank you very much, you've been a great audience.
At some point, most sexually active people will be infected with human papillomavirus, or ‘HPV.’ There are over 100 types of HPV, and most of the time the body eliminates infections without symptoms– but some strains can pose serious health risks down the line.
HPV causes contact infections, which means the virus stays in the cells near the point of infection rather than spreading throughout the whole body.
Since HPV is often transmitted through sexual activity, this usually means the cells of the vagina, vulva, penis, anus, mouth and throat.
We can test for HPV in cells from these areas, but while testing for the virus is scientifically possible, it isn’t common.
The main reason is that, while there are treatments for the adverse health effects caused by HPV, there’s no treatment for the virus itself.
So testing for HPV would yield many, many positives, and although most of them won’t be cause for concern, there is still no treatment plan for clearing the body of the virus.
But there are other good ways to protect yourself from HPV.
We’re going to walk through how HPV can cause harm, who’s at risk, and how to minimize those risks.
The body’s immune system is able to eradicate most strains of HPV before they cause any harm— and without people even knowing they’ve been infected.
Certain other strains– like HPV 6 and 11– cause abnormalities in the cells of the infected tissue, which can develop into genital warts.
While these are infectious and require treatment, usually with topical creams, wart-causing strains don’t create longer-term damage.
But another 13 strains can cause DNA mutations that cause cells to divide at a much faster pace than normal, propelling the development of cancerous growths.
The cells of the cervix are especially at risks.
Two in particular– HPV 16 and 18– are responsible for the majority of cases of cervical cancer, which is now the fourth most common type of cancer in women.
It can take up to 20 years for cancer symptoms to appear, but with regular screening, we can discover cellular abnormalities in the cervix before they develop into cancer.
Women over 21 can undergo a regular pap smear, where a sample of tissue is gently scraped from the lining of the cervix to test for abnormal cells.
A positive test doesn’t mean the person has cervical cancer, but rather that there are irregular cells in the cervix that could develop into cancer in the future.
Patients are then either monitored with more frequent pap smears, or, for more severe irregularities, undergo a procedure called a colposcopy.
This involves a doctor examining the cervix through a microscope, and possibly taking a small biopsy of tissue for closer examination.
In some cases, the affected tissue may be removed.
HPV infections of the throat may lead to head and neck cancers, but for now there’s no equivalent of the pap smear for the throat.
Using condoms helps prevent the spread of HPV during sex.
And there are three safe, effective vaccines that all target HPV 16 and 18.
The vaccine comes in two or three doses a few months apart, and it’s only beneficial if you receive them all.
Right now the vaccine is part of standard care for girls aged 11 to 18 in many countries– though it’s increasingly becoming available to boys as well.
Adult women and men in countries including the United States and the United Kingdom can opt to receive the vaccine, and evidence suggests that vaccination of women and men could reduce the worldwide incidence of cervical cancer by almost 90%.
Researchers are also developing an injection for people who are already infected with HPV 16 and 18, which would target the infected cells to stop them from developing into cancerous ones.
So while there’s still room for improvement in screening, treatment, and access to each, condom use, vaccination, and cervical screening can each reduce the harm caused by HPV.
When Ireneo Funes looked at a glass of wine on a table, he saw “all the shoots, clusters, and grapes of the vine.
He remembered the shapes of the clouds in the south at the dawn of the 30th of April of 1882, and he could compare them in his recollection with the marbled grain in the design of a leather-bound book which he had seen only once, and with the lines in the spray which an oar raised in the Rio Negro on the eve of the battle of the Quebrancho.” In the short story “Funes, the Memorious,” Jorge Luis Borges explores what it would be like to have a perfect memory.
His character not only remembers everything he has ever seen, but every time he has seen it in perfect detail.
These details are so overwhelming Funes has to spend his days in a dark room, and can only sleep by imagining a part of town he has never visited.
According to Borges, Funes’s memories even rendered him incapable of real thought, because “To think is to forget a difference, to generalize, to abstract.
In the overly replete world of Funes there were nothing but details.” Funes’ limitless memory was just one of Borges’s many explorations of infinity.
Born in Argentina in 1899, he admired the revolutionaries of his mother’s family but took after his father’s bookish clan.
His body of essays, poems, and stories, or, as he called them, ficciones pioneered the literary style of “lo real maravilloso,” known in English as Magical Realism— and each was just a few pages long.
Though Borges was not interested in writing long books, he was an avid reader, recruiting friends to read to him after he went blind in middle age.
He said his image of paradise was an infinite library, an idea he brought to life in “The library of Babel.” Built out of countless identical rooms, each containing the same number of books of the same length, the library of babel is its own universe.
It contains every possible variation of text, so there are some profound books, but also countless tomes of complete gibberish.
The narrator has spent his entire life wandering this vast labyrinth of information in a possibly futile search for meaning.
Labyrinths appeared over and over in Borges’ work.
In “The Garden of Forking Paths,” as Yu Tsun winds his way through country roads, he remembers a lost labyrinth built by one of his ancestors.
Over the course of the story, he finds out the labyrinth is not a physical maze but a novel.
And this novel reveals that the real Garden of Forking Paths is time: in every instant, there are infinite possible courses of action.
And as one moment follows another, each possibility begets another set of divergent futures.
Borges laid out infinite expanses of time in his labyrinths, but he also explored the idea of condensing all of time into a single moment.
In “The God’s Script,” at the very beginning of the world the god writes exactly one message into the spots of the jaguars, who then “love and reproduce without end, in caverns, in cane fields, on islands, in order that the last men might receive it.” The last man turns out to be a tenacious old priest who spends years memorizing and deciphering the jaguar’s spots, culminating in an epiphany where he finally understands the god’s message.
Imprisoned deep underground, he has no one to share this meaning with, and it changes nothing about his circumstances, but he doesn’t mind: in that one moment, he has experienced all the experience of everyone who has ever existed.
Reading Borges, you might catch a glimpse of infinity too.
I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation, sharing some of the problems.
And Warren Buffet had recommended I do that -- being honest about what was going well, what wasn't, and making it kind of an annual thing.
A goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems, because I think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally.
That is, the market does not drive the scientists, the communicators, the thinkers, the governments to do the right things.
And only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to.
So this morning I'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand.
But before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist.
Any tough problem, I think it can be solved.
And part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past.
Over the past century, average lifespan has more than doubled.
Another statistic, perhaps my favorite, is to look at childhood deaths.
As recently as 1960, 110 million children were born, and 20 million of those died before the age of five.
Five years ago, 135 million children were born -- so, more -- and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five.
So that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate.
It's a phenomenal thing.
Each one of those lives matters a lot.
And the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs: vaccines that were used more widely.
For example, measles was four million of the deaths back as recently as 1990 and now is under 400,000.
So we really can make changes.
The next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again.
And I think that's doable in well under 20 years.
Why? Well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths: diarrhea, pneumonia and malaria.
So that brings us to the first problem that I'll raise this morning, which is how do we stop a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitos?
Well, what's the history of this disease?
It's been a severe disease for thousands of years.
In fact, if we look at the genetic code, it's the only disease we can see that people who lived in Africa actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths.
Deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s.
So it was absolutely gigantic.
And the disease was all over the world.
A terrible disease. It was in the United States. It was in Europe.
People didn't know what caused it until the early 1900s, when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitos.
So it was everywhere.
And two tools helped bring the death rate down.
One was killing the mosquitos with DDT.
The other was treating the patients with quinine, or quinine derivatives.
And so that's why the death rate did come down.
Now, ironically, what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones, which is where the rich countries are.
So we can see: 1900, it's everywhere.
1945, it's still most places.
1970, the U.S. and most of Europe have gotten rid of it.
1990, you've gotten most of the northern areas.
And more recently you can see it's just around the equator.
And so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poorer countries, it doesn't get much investment.
For example, there's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria.
Now, baldness, it's a terrible thing.
(Laughter) And rich men are afflicted.
And so that's why that priority has been set.
But, malaria -- even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact.
Over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it.
It means that you can't get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so much.
Now, malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos.
I brought some here, just so you could experience this.
We'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit.
(Laughter) There's no reason only poor people should have the experience.
(Laughter) (Applause) Those mosquitos are not infected.
So we've come up with a few new things. We've got bed nets.
And bed nets are a great tool.
What it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night, so the mosquitos that bite late at night can't get at them.
And when you use indoor spraying with DDT and those nets you can cut deaths by over 50 percent.
And that's happened now in a number of countries.
It's great to see.
But we have to be careful because malaria -- the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves.
So every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective.
And so you end up with two choices.
If you go into a country with the right tools and the right way, you do it vigorously, you can actually get a local eradication.
And that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking.
Or, if you go in kind of half-heartedly, for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden, but eventually those tools will become ineffective, and the death rate will soar back up again.
And the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention.
Now we're on the upswing.
Bed net funding is up.
There's new drug discovery going on.
Our foundation has backed a vaccine that's going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months.
And that should save over two thirds of the lives if it's effective.
So we're going to have these new tools.
But that alone doesn't give us the road map.
Because the road map to get rid of this disease involves many things.
It involves communicators to keep the funding high, to keep the visibility high, to tell the success stories.
It involves social scientists, so we know how to get not just 70 percent of the people to use the bed nets, but 90 percent.
We need mathematicians to come in and simulate this, to do Monte Carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together.
Of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise.
We need rich-world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things.
And so as these elements come together, I'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria.
Now let me turn to a second question, a fairly different question, but I'd say equally important.
And this is: How do you make a teacher great?
It seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on, and we'd understand very well.
And the answer is, really, that we don't.
Let's start with why this is important.
Well, all of us here, I'll bet, had some great teachers.
We all had a wonderful education.
That's part of the reason we're here today, part of the reason we're successful.
I can say that, even though I'm a college drop-out.
I had great teachers.
In fact, in the United States, the teaching system has worked fairly well.
There are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places.
So the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education.
And those top 20 percent have been the best in the world, if you measure them against the other top 20 percent.
And they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the U.S. at the forefront.
Now, the strength for those top 20 percent is starting to fade on a relative basis, but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting.
Not only has that been weak. it's getting weaker.
And if you look at the economy, it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education.
And we have to change this.
We have to change it so that people have equal opportunity.
We have to change it so that the country is strong and stays at the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education, like science and mathematics.
When I first learned the statistics, I was pretty stunned at how bad things are.
Over 30 percent of kids never finish high school.
And that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate as the number who started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year.
Because they weren't tracking where the kids were before that.
But most of the dropouts had taken place before that.
They had to raise the stated dropout rate as soon as that tracking was done to over 30 percent.
For minority kids, it's over 50 percent.
And even if you graduate from high school, if you're low-income, you have less than a 25 percent chance of ever completing a college degree.
If you're low-income in the United States, you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four-year degree.
And that doesn't seem entirely fair.
So, how do you make education better?
Now, our foundation, for the last nine years, has invested in this.
There's many people working on it.
We've worked on small schools, we've funded scholarships, we've done things in libraries.
A lot of these things had a good effect.
But the more we looked at it, the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing.
And we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers, between, say, the top quartile -- the very best -- and the bottom quartile.
How much variation is there within a school or between schools?
And the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable.
A top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class -- based on test scores -- by over 10 percent in a single year.
What does that mean?
That means that if the entire U.S., for two years, had top quartile teachers, the entire difference between us and Asia would go away.
Within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away.
So, it's simple. All you need are those top quartile teachers.
And so you'd say, "Wow, we should reward those people.
We should retain those people.
We should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people."
But I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today.
What are the characteristics of this top quartile?
What do they look like?
You might think these must be very senior teachers.
And the answer is no.
Once somebody has taught for three years their teaching quality does not change thereafter.
The variation is very, very small.
You might think these are people with master's degrees.
They've gone back and they've gotten their Master's of Education.
This chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality.
That bottom thing, which says there's no effect at all, is a master's degree.
Now, the way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded.
One is seniority.
Because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension.
The second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree.
But it in no way is associated with being a better teacher.
Teach for America: slight effect.
For math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect.
But, overwhelmingly, it's your past performance.
There are some people who are very good at this.
And we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in and to replicate it, to raise the average capability -- or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system.
You might say, "Do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher's leave?"
The answer is, on average, the slightly better teachers leave the system.
And it's a system with very high turnover.
Now, there are a few places -- very few -- where great teachers are being made.
A good example of one is a set of charter schools called KIPP.
KIPP means Knowledge Is Power.
It's an unbelievable thing.
They have 66 schools -- mostly middle schools, some high schools -- and what goes on is great teaching.
They take the poorest kids, and over 96 percent of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges.
And the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public schools.
They're team teaching. They're constantly improving their teachers.
They're taking data, the test scores, and saying to a teacher, "Hey, you caused this amount of increase."
They're deeply engaged in making teaching better.
When you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms, at first it's very bizarre.
I sat down and I thought, "What is going on?"
The teacher was running around, and the energy level was high.
I thought, "I'm in the sports rally or something.
What's going on?"
And the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention, which kids were bored, and calling kids rapidly, putting things up on the board.
It was a very dynamic environment, because particularly in those middle school years -- fifth through eighth grade -- keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention, nobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who doesn't want to be there.
Everybody needs to be involved.
And so KIPP is doing it.
How does that compare to a normal school?
Well, in a normal school, teachers aren't told how good they are.
The data isn't gathered.
In the teacher's contract, it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom -- sometimes to once per year.
And they need advanced notice to do that.
So imagine running a factory where you've got these workers, some of them just making crap and the management is told, "Hey, you can only come down here once a year, but you need to let us know, because we might actually fool you, and try and do a good job in that one brief moment."
Even a teacher who wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it.
They don't have the test scores, and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data.
For example, New York passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure decision for the teachers.
And so that's sort of working in the opposite direction.
But I'm optimistic about this, I think there are some clear things we can do.
First of all, there's a lot more testing going on, and that's given us the picture of where we are.
And that allows us to understand who's doing it well, and call them out, and find out what those techniques are.
Of course, digital video is cheap now.
Putting a few cameras in the classroom and saying that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis is very practical in all public schools.
And so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say, "OK, here's a little clip of something I thought I did well.
Here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly.
Advise me -- when this kid acted up, how should I have dealt with that?"
And they could all sit and work together on those problems.
You can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it, have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff.
You can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course, learn from that.
If you have a kid who's behind, you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept.
And in fact, these free courses could not only be available just on the Internet, but you could make it so that DVDs were always available, and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers.
And so by thinking of this as a personnel system, we can do it much better.
Now there's a book actually, about KIPP -- the place that this is going on -- that Jay Matthews, a news reporter, wrote -- called, "Work Hard, Be Nice."
And I thought it was so fantastic.
It gave you a sense of what a good teacher does.
I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book.
(Applause) Now, we put a lot of money into education, and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a future as it should have.
In fact we have in the stimulus bill -- it's interesting -- the House version actually had money in it for these data systems, and it was taken out in the Senate because there are people who are threatened by these things.
But I -- I'm optimistic.
I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is, and it really can make a difference for millions of lives, if we get it right.
I only had time to frame those two problems.
There's a lot more problems like that -- AIDS, pneumonia -- I can just see you're getting excited, just at the very name of these things.
And the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad.
You know, the system doesn't naturally make it happen.
Governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way.
The private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things.
So it's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things, get other people involved -- and you're helping to come up with solutions.
And with that, I think there's some great things that will come out of it.
Thank you.
(Applause)
It’s an incredible discovery: an ancient, abandoned alien space station filled with precursor technology.
But now, every species in the galaxy is in a mad dash to get there first and claim it for themselves.
And right away, you’ve got a problem.
Your ship’s faster-than-light jump drive consumes 1 unit of fuel for every parsec of distance it takes you, and your ship holds only 15 units of fuel.
But the space station is 23 parsecs away, and there’s only empty space between there and here.
There’s one thing that can help you, though: dark matter fuel is stable in deep space.
That means you can vent a cache of it from your fuel chamber, and then come back to pick it up again later.
Even though your ship holds only 15 units of fuel, you’ve been granted use of all 45 units in your current location.
With some strategic fuel caching along the way, you might be able to make it all 23 parsecs.
So how can you reach the alien space station?
Answer in 3, 2, 1.
It’s possible to solve this riddle using as few as two cache points, and there are also valid solutions that use more.
No matter how you go about it though, the key is determining exactly where to cache fuel along your route.
Let’s work backwards from the alien space station.
To reach 23 parsecs, you’ll have to leave the 8-parsec mark with a full tank of fuel.
The 8-parsec point is too far from the start to use as a cache right away; you could jump there, but wouldn’t have enough fuel to return to the start, let alone store any for later.
So that means you’ll need to find a cache somewhere between the start and 8.
But where?
There’s an interesting pattern that can help.
At the start you have exactly 3 tanks’ worth of fuel.
At 8 parsecs you need exactly 1.
Is there a point, which we can call point X, where you could have exactly 2?
That would be useful, because then you could refuel there exactly twice, making full use of your storage capacity without any waste.
Wherever point X is, you’ll jump forward from it twice: once to deposit some fuel at the 8-parsec cache point, and a second time for good.
So you’ll jump the distance between X and 8-parsecs 3 times in all.
You’d have 2 tanks of fuel at point X, and need 1 left at the 8 parsec cache point, so you can spend one tank-- or 15 units-- going back and forth.
Since 15 units divided by 3 trips is 5, we can place these two cache points 5 parsecs apart.
Any farther, and you wouldn’t have enough fuel to reach the alien space station.
So it looks like the earliest we can place point X is at the 3-parsec mark.
Is it possible to transport 30 units of fuel there? Let’s try.
You set out with a full tank of 15 units.
You jump 3 parsecs, drop 9 units off at the cache point, and then jump the 3 units home, arriving with an empty tank.
Repeating this process gets you 18 units of fuel at the cache point, and one more jump puts you at the 3-parsec cache with 30 total units of fuel.
So far so good!
Next, you jump to the 8-parsec mark, drop off 5 units of fuel, and jump back to the 3-parsec mark.
You fill up your tank and jump forward again, arriving with 10 units of fuel in your tank.
And now the end is in sight.
You beam the 5 units of fuel in from deep space to fill your tank to capacity, and type in the coordinates of your final destination.
A 15-parsec jump leaves you running on fumes, but ready to dock with the precursor space station.
Time to put this alien tech to work and make life better for everyone in the galaxy.
I'm a storyteller, but I'm also a troublemaker.
(Laughter) And I have a habit of asking difficult questions.
It started when I was 10 years old, and my mother, who was raising six children, had no time for them.
At 14, fed up with my increasingly annoying questions, she recommended that I begin writing for the local English-language newspaper in Pakistan, to put my questions out to the entire country, she said.
(Laughter) At 17, I was an undercover investigative journalist.
I don't even think my editor knew just how young I was when I sent in a story that named and shamed some very powerful people.
The men I'd written about wanted to teach me a lesson.
They wanted to shame me and my family.
They spray-painted my name and my family's name with unspeakable profanities across our front gate and around our neighborhood.
And they felt that my father, who was a strict man of tradition, would stop me.
Instead, my father stood in front of me and said, "If you speak the truth, I will stand with you, and so will the world."
And then he got -- (Applause) And then he got a group of people together and they whitewashed the walls.
(Laughter) I've always wanted my stories to jolt people, to shake them into having difficult conversations.
And I felt that I would be more effective if I did something visual.
And so at 21, I became a documentary filmmaker, turning my camera onto marginalized communities on the front lines in war zones, eventually returning home to Pakistan, where I wanted to document violence against women.
Pakistan is home to 200 million people.
And with its low levels of literacy, film can change the way people perceive issues.
An effective storyteller speaks to our emotions, elicits empathy and compassion, and forces us to look at things differently.
In my country, film had the potential to go beyond cinema.
It could change lives.
The issues that I've always wanted to raise -- I've always wanted to hold up a mirror to society -- they've been driven by my barometer of anger.
And my barometer of anger led me, in 2014, to honor killings.
Honor killings take place in many parts of the world, where men punish women who transgress rules made by them: women who choose to marry on their own free will; or women who are looking for a divorce; or women who are suspected of having illicit relationships.
In the rest of the world, honor killings would be known as murder.
I always wanted to tell that story from the perspective of a survivor.
But women do not live to tell their tale and instead end up in unmarked graves.
So one morning when I was reading the newspaper, and I read that a young woman had miraculously survived after being shot in the face by her father and her uncle because she chose to marry a man out of her free will, I knew I had found my storyteller.
Saba was determined to send her father and her uncle to jail, but in the days after leaving the hospital, pressure mounted on her to forgive.
You see, there was a loophole in the law that allowed for victims to forgive perpetrators, enabling them to avoid jail time.
And she was told that she would be ostracized and her family, her in-laws, they would all be shunned from the community, because many felt that her father had been well within his right, given her transgression.
She fought on -- for months.
But on the final day in court, she gave a statement forgiving them.
As filmmakers, we were devastated, because this was not the film that we had set out to make.
In hindsight, had she pressed charges, fought the case and won, hers would have been an exception.
When such a strong woman is silenced, what chance did other women have?
And we began to think about using our film to change the way people perceived honor killings, to impact the loophole in the law.
And then our film was nominated for an Academy Award, and honor killings became headline news, and the prime minister, while sending his congratulations, offered to host the first screening of the film at his office.
Of course, we jumped at the chance, because no prime minister in the history of the country had ever done so.
And at the screening, which was carried live on national television, he said something that reverberated throughout the country: "There is no honor in honor killings," he said.
(Applause) At the Academy Awards in LA, many of the pundits had written us off, but we felt that in order for the legislative push to continue, we needed that win.
And then, my name was announced, and I bounded up the steps in flip-flops, because I didn't expect to be onstage.
(Laughter) And I accepted the statue, telling a billion people watching that the prime minister of Pakistan had pledged to change the law, because, of course, that's one way of holding the prime minister accountable.
(Laughter) And -- (Applause) Back home, the Oscar win dominated headline news, and more people joined the fray, asking for the loophole in the law to be closed.
And then in October 2016, after months of campaigning, the loophole was indeed closed.
(Applause) And now men who kill women in the name of honor receive life imprisonment.
(Applause) Yet, the very next day, a woman was killed in the name of honor, and then another and another.
We had impacted legislation, but that wasn't enough.
We needed to take the film and its message to the heartland, to small towns and villages across the country.
You see, for me, cinema can play a very positive role in changing and molding society in a positive direction.
But how would we get to these places?
How would we get to these small towns and villages?
We built a mobile cinema, a truck that would roll through the length and breadth of the country, that would stop in small towns and villages.
We outfitted it with a large screen that would light up the night sky, and we called it "Look But With Love."
It would give the community an opportunity to come together and watch films in the evening.
We knew we could attract men and children in the mobile cinema.
They would come out and watch.
But what about women?
In these small, rural communities that are segregated, how would we get women to come out?
We had to work with prevailing cultural norms in order to do so, and so we built a cinema inside the cinema, outfitting it with seats and a screen where women could go inside and watch without fearing or being embarrassed or harassment.
We began to introduce everyone to films that opened up their minds to competing worldviews, encouraging children to build critical thinking so that they could ask questions.
And we expanded our scope beyond honor killings, talking about income inequality, the environment, talking about ethnic relations, religious tolerance and compassion.
And inside, for women, we showed them films in which they were heroes, not victims, and we told them how they could navigate the court system, the police system, educating them about their rights, telling them where they could seek refuge if they were victims of domestic violence, where they could go and get help.
We were surprised that we were welcomed in so many of the places that we went to.
Many of the towns had never seen television or social media, and they were eager for their children to learn.
But there was also pushback and blowback with the ideas that we were bringing with us.
Two members of our mobile cinema team resigned because of threats from villages.
And in one of the villages that we were screening in, they shut it down and said they didn't want the women to know about their rights.
But on the flip side, in another village when a screening was shut down, a plainclothes policeman got up and ordered it back on, and stood by, protecting our team, telling everyone that it was his duty to expose the young minds to an alternative worldview and to this content.
He was an ordinary hero.
But we've come across so many of these heroes on our journey.
In another town, where the men said that only they could watch and the women had to stay home, a community elder got up, got a group of people together, had a discussion, and then both men and women sat down to watch together.
We are documenting what we are doing.
We talk to people.
We adapt.
We change the lineup of films.
When we show men films that show perpetrators of violence behind bars, we want to hit home the fact that if men are violent, there will be repercussions.
But we also show films where men are seen as championing women, because we want to encourage them to take on those roles.
For women, when we show them films in which they are heads of state or where they are lawyers and doctors and in leadership positions, we talk to them and encourage them to step into those roles.
We are changing the way people in these villages interact, and we're taking our learnings into other places.
Recently, a group contacted us and wants to take our mobile cinema to Bangladesh and Syria, and we're sharing our learnings with them.
We feel it's really important to take what we are doing and spread it across the world.
In small towns and villages across Pakistan, men are changing the way they interact with women, children are changing the way they see the world, one village at a time, through cinema.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I am a writer.
Writing books is my profession but it's more than that, of course.
It is also my great lifelong love and fascination.
And I don't expect that that's ever going to change.
But, that said, something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career, which has caused me to have to recalibrate my whole relationship with this work.
And the peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book, this memoir called "Eat, Pray, Love" which, decidedly unlike any of my previous books, went out in the world for some reason, and became this big, mega-sensation, international bestseller thing.
The result of which is that everywhere I go now, people treat me like I'm doomed.
Seriously -- doomed, doomed!
Like, they come up to me now, all worried, and they say, "Aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that?
Aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all, ever again?"
So that's reassuring, you know.
But it would be worse, except for that I happen to remember that over 20 years ago, when I was a teenager, when I first started telling people that I wanted to be a writer, I was met with this same sort of fear-based reaction.
And people would say, "Aren't you afraid you're never going to have any success?
Aren't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you?
Aren't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing's ever going to come of it and you're going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure?"
(Laughter) Like that, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all those questions is, "Yes."
Yes, I'm afraid of all those things.
And I always have been.
And I'm afraid of many, many more things besides that people can't even guess at, like seaweed and other things that are scary.
But, when it comes to writing, the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lately, and wondering about lately, is why?
You know, is it rational?
Is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do.
And what is it specifically about creative ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don't do, you know?
Like my dad, for example, was a chemical engineer and I don't recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer, you know?
"That chemical-engineering block, John, how's it going?"
It just didn't come up like that, you know?
But to be fair, chemical engineers as a group haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic-depressives.
(Laughter) We writers, we kind of do have that reputation, and not just writers, but creative people across all genres, it seems, have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable.
And all you have to do is look at the very grim death count in the 20th century alone, of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands, you know?
And even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone by their gifts, you know.
Norman Mailer, just before he died, last interview, he said, "Every one of my books has killed me a little more."
An extraordinary statement to make about your life's work.
But we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this, because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry, in the end, will always ultimately lead to anguish.
And the question that I want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea?
Are you comfortable with that?
Because you look at it even from an inch away and, you know -- I'm not at all comfortable with that assumption.
I think it's odious.
And I also think it's dangerous, and I don't want to see it perpetuated into the next century.
I think it's better if we encourage our great creative minds to live.
And I definitely know that, in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption, particularly given the circumstance that I'm in right now in my career.
Which is -- you know, like check it out, I'm pretty young, I'm only about 40 years old.
I still have maybe another four decades of work left in me.
And it's exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book, right?
I should just put it bluntly, because we're all sort of friends here now -- it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me.
So Jesus, what a thought!
That's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning, and I don't want to go there.
(Laughter) I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love.
And so, the question becomes, how?
And so, it seems to me, upon a lot of reflection, that the way that I have to work now, in order to continue writing, is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct, right?
I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me, as I am writing, and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be, from now on.
And, as I've been looking, over the last year, for models for how to do that, I've been sort of looking across time, and I've been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity.
And that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome.
So stay with me, because it does circle around and back.
But, ancient Greece and ancient Rome -- people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then, OK?
People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source, for distant and unknowable reasons.
The Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity "daemons."
Socrates, famously, believed that he had a daemon who spoke wisdom to him from afar.
The Romans had the same idea, but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius.
Which is great, because the Romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual.
They believed that a genius was this, sort of magical divine entity, who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist's studio, kind of like Dobby the house elf, and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work.
So brilliant -- there it is, right there, that distance that I'm talking about -- that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work.
And everyone knew that this is how it functioned, right?
So the ancient artist was protected from certain things, like, for example, too much narcissism, right?
If your work was brilliant, you couldn't take all the credit for it, everybody knew that you had this disembodied genius who had helped you.
If your work bombed, not entirely your fault, you know?
Everyone knew your genius was kind of lame.
(Laughter) And this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time.
And then the Renaissance came and everything changed, and we had this big idea, and the big idea was, let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all gods and mysteries, and there's no more room for mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine.
And it's the beginning of rational humanism, and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual.
And for the first time in history, you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius, rather than having a genius.
And I got to tell you, I think that was a huge error.
You know, I think that allowing somebody, one mere person to believe that he or she is like, the vessel, you know, like the font and the essence and the source of all divine, creative, unknowable, eternal mystery is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile, human psyche.
It's like asking somebody to swallow the sun.
It just completely warps and distorts egos, and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance.
And I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years.
And, if this is true, and I think it is true, the question becomes, what now?
Can we do this differently?
Maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought in one 18 minute speech.
And there's probably people in this audience who would raise really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of, basically, fairies who follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff.
I'm not, probably, going to bring you all along with me on this.
But the question that I kind of want to pose is -- you know, why not?
Why not think about it this way?
Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process.
A process which, as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here --- knows does not always behave rationally.
And, in fact, can sometimes feel downright paranormal.
I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone, who's now in her 90s, but she's been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia, she would be out working in the fields, and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape.
And she said it was like a thunderous train of air.
And it would come barreling down at her over the landscape.
And she felt it coming, because it would shake the earth under her feet.
She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point, and that was to, in her words, "run like hell."
And she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting chased by this poem, and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her, she could collect it and grab it on the page.
And other times she wouldn't be fast enough, so she'd be running and running, and she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape, looking, as she put it "for another poet."
And then there were these times -- this is the piece I never forgot -- she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it, right?
So, she's running to the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her, and she grabs a pencil just as it's going through her, and then she said, it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it.
She would catch the poem by its tail, and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page.
And in these instances, the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards, from the last word to the first.
(Laughter) So when I heard that I was like -- that's uncanny, that's exactly what my creative process is like.
(Laughter) That's not at all what my creative process is -- I'm not the pipeline!
I'm a mule, and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every day, and sweat and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly.
But even I, in my mulishness, even I have brushed up against that thing, at times.
And I would imagine that a lot of you have too.
You know, even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify.
And what is that thing?
And how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds, but, in fact, might actually keep us sane?
And for me, the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that is the musician Tom Waits, who I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment.
And we were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for most of his life, he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist, trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses that were totally internalized.
But then he got older, he got calmer, and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles, and this is when it all changed for him.
And he's speeding along, and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of melody, that comes into his head as inspiration often comes, elusive and tantalizing, and he wants it, it's gorgeous, and he longs for it, but he has no way to get it.
He doesn't have a piece of paper, or a pencil, or a tape recorder.
So he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him like, "I'm going to lose this thing, and I'll be be haunted by this song forever.
I'm not good enough, and I can't do it."
And instead of panicking, he just stopped.
He just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel.
He just looked up at the sky, and he said, "Excuse me, can you not see that I'm driving?"
(Laughter) "Do I look like I can write down a song right now?
If you really want to exist, come back at a more opportune moment when I can take care of you.
Otherwise, go bother somebody else today.
Go bother Leonard Cohen."
And his whole work process changed after that.
Not the work, the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever.
But the process, and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie, the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble, and released it back where it came from, and realized that this didn't have to be this internalized, tormented thing.
It could be this peculiar, wondrous, bizarre collaboration, kind of conversation between Tom and the strange, external thing that was not quite Tom.
When I heard that story, it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too, and this idea already saved me once.
It saved me when I was in the middle of writing "Eat, Pray, Love," and I fell into one of those sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster, the worst book ever written.
Not just bad, but the worst book ever written.
And I started to think I should just dump this project.
But then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I tried it.
So I just lifted my face up from the manuscript and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room.
And I said aloud, "Listen you, thing, you and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant that is not entirely my fault, right?
Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this, I don't have any more than this.
If you want it to be better, you've got to show up and do your part of the deal.
But if you don't do that, you know what, the hell with it.
I'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job.
And I would please like the record to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job."
(Laughter) Because -- (Applause) Because in the end it's like this, OK -- centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa, people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours, until dawn.
They were always magnificent, because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific, right?
But every once in a while, very rarely, something would happen, and one of these performers would actually become transcendent.
And I know you know what I'm talking about, because I know you've all seen, at some point in your life, a performance like this.
It was like time would stop, and the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done, 1,000 nights before, but everything would align.
And all of a sudden, he would no longer appear to be merely human.
He would be lit from within, and lit from below and all lit up on fire with divinity.
And when this happened, back then, people knew it for what it was, you know, they called it by its name.
They would put their hands together and they would start to chant, "Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God."
That's God, you know.
Curious historical footnote: when the Moors invaded southern Spain, they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from "Allah, Allah, Allah," to "Olé, olé, olé," which you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances.
In Spain, when a performer has done something impossible and magic, "Allah, olé, olé, Allah, magnificent, bravo," incomprehensible, there it is -- a glimpse of God.
Which is great, because we need that.
But, the tricky bit comes the next morning, for the dancer himself, when he wakes up and discovers that it's Tuesday at 11 a.m., and he's no longer a glimpse of God.
He's just an aging mortal with really bad knees, and maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again.
And maybe nobody will ever chant God's name again as he spins, and what is he then to do with the rest of his life?
This is hard.
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of anguish if you never happened to believe, in the first place, that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you.
But maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you're finished, with somebody else.
And, you know, if we think about it this way, it starts to change everything.
This is how I've started to think, and this is certainly how I've been thinking in the last few months as I've been working on the book that will soon be published, as the dangerously, frighteningly over-anticipated follow up to my freakish success.
And what I have to sort of keep telling myself when I get really psyched out about that is don't be afraid.
Don't be daunted. Just do your job.
Continue to show up for your piece of it, whatever that might be.
If your job is to dance, do your dance.
If the divine, cockeyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed, for just one moment through your efforts, then "Olé!"
And if not, do your dance anyhow.
And "Olé!" to you, nonetheless.
I believe this and I feel that we must teach it.
"Olé!" to you, nonetheless, just for having the sheer human love and stubbornness to keep showing up.
Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you.
(Applause) June Cohen: Olé!
(Applause)
[This talk contains graphic language Viewer discretion is advised] So, this is the first and the last slide each of my 6,400 students over the last 15 years has seen.
I do not believe you can build a multibillion-dollar organization unless you are clear on which instinct or organ you are targeting.
Our species has a need for a superbeing.
Our competitive advantage as a species is our brain.
Our brain is robust enough to ask these really difficult questions, but, unfortunately, it doesn't have the processing power to answer them, which creates a need for a superbeing that we can pray to and look to for answers.
What is prayer?
Sending a query into the universe, and hopefully there's some sort of divine intervention -- we don't need to understand what's going on -- from an all-knowing, all-seeing superbeing that gives us authority that this is the right answer.
"Will my kid be all right?"
You have your planet of stuff, you have your planet of work, you have your planet of friends.
If you have kids, you know that once something comes off the rails with your kids, everything melts, in your universe to the Sun that is your kids.
"Will my kid be all right?"
"Symptoms and treatment of croup" in the Google query box.
One in six queries presented to Google have never been asked before in the history of mankind.
What priest, teacher, rabbi, scholar, mentor, boss has so much credibility that one in six questions posed to that person have never been asked before?
Google is our modern man's God.
Imagine your face and your name above everything you've put into that box, and you're going to realize you trust Google more than any entity in your history.
(Laughter) Let's move further down the torso.
(Laughter) One of the other wonderful things about our species is we not only need to be loved, but we need to love others.
Children with poor nutrition but a lot of affection have better outcomes than children with good nutrition and poor affection.
However, the best signal that you might make it to be part of the number-one fastest growing demographic in the world -- centenarians, people who live to triple digits -- there are three signals.
In reverse order: your genetics -- not as important as you'd like to think, so you can continue to treat your body like shit and think, "Oh, Uncle Joe lived to 95, the die have been cast."
It's less important than you think.
Number two is lifestyle.
Don't smoke, don't be obese, and prescreen -- get rid of about two-thirds of early cancers and cardiovascular disease.
The number one indicator or signal that you'll make it to triple digits: How many people do you love?
Caretaking is the security camera -- we call the low-resolution security camera in our brain -- deciding whether or not you are adding value.
Facebook taps into our instinctive need not only to be loved, but to love others, mostly through pictures that create empathy, catalyze and reinforce our relationships.
Let's continue our journey down the torso.
Amazon is our consumptive gut.
The instinct of more is hardwired into us.
The penalty for too little is starvation and malnutrition.
Open your cupboards, open your closets, you have 10 to 100x times what you need.
Why?
Because the penalty for too little is much greater than the penalty for too much.
So "more for less" is a business strategy that never goes out of style.
It's the strategy of China, it's a the strategy of Walmart, and now it's the strategy of the most successful company in the world, Amazon.
You get more for less into your gut; digest, send it to your muscular and skeletal system of consumption.
Moving further, once we know we will survive, the basic instinct, we move to the second most powerful instinct, and that is to spread and select the strongest, smartest and fastest seed to the four corners of the earth, or pick the best seed.
This is not a timepiece.
I haven't wound it in five years.
It's my vain attempt to say to people, "If you mate with me, your children are more likely to survive than if you mate with someone wearing a Swatch watch."
(Laughter) The key to business is tapping into the irrational organs.
"Irrational" is Harvard Business School's and New York Business School's term for fat profit margins and shareholder value.
"High-caloric paste for your children."
No?
You love your choosy mom.
Why choosy moms choose Jif: you love your kids more.
The greatest algorithm for shareholder creation from World War II to the advent of Google was taking an average product and appealing to people's hearts.
You're a better a mom, a better person, a better patriot if you buy this average soap versus this average soap.
Now, the number one algorithm for shareholder value isn't technology.
Look at the Forbes 400.
Take out inherited wealth, take out finance.
The number one source of wealth creation: appealing to your reproductive organs.
The Lauders; the number one wealthiest man in Europe, LVMH.
Numbers two and three: H&amp;M and Inditex.
You want to target the most irrational organs for shareholder value.
As a result, these four companies -- Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google -- have disarticulated who we are.
God, love, consumption, sex.
The proportion in your approach to those things is who you are, and they have reassembled who we are in the form of for-profit companies.
At the end of the Great Recession, the market capitalization of these companies was equivalent to the GDP of Niger.
Now it is equivalent to the GDP of India, having blown past Russia and Canada in '13 and '14.
There are only five nations that have a GDP greater than the combined market capitalization of these four firms.
Something is happening, though.
The conversation just a year ago was, which CEO was more Jesus-like?
Who was running for president?
Now the worm has turned.
Everything they're doing is bothering us.
We're worried they're tax avoiders.
Walmart, since the Great Recession, has paid 64 billion dollars in corporate income tax; Amazon has paid 1.4.
How do we pay our firefighters, our soldiers and our social workers if the most successful companies in the world don't pay their fair share?
Pretty easy.
That means the less successful companies have to pay more than their fair share.
Alexa, is this a good thing?
This is despite that fact -- (Laughter) This is despite the fact that Amazon has added the entire market capitalization of Walmart to its market cap in the last 19 months.
Whose fault is it? It's our fault.
We're electing regulators who don't have the backbone to actually go after these companies.
Facebook lies to EU regulators and says, "It would be impossible for us to share the data between our core platform and our proposed acquisition of WhatsApp.
Approve the merger."
They approve the merger and then -- spoiler alert! -- they figure it out.
And the EU says, "I feel lied to.
We're fining you 120 [million] dollars," about .6 percent of the acquisition price of 19 billion dollars.
If Mark Zuckerberg could take out an insurance policy that the acquisition would go through for .6 percent, wouldn't he do it?
Anticompetitive behavior.
A two-and-a-half-billion-dollar fine, three billion of the cash flow, three percent of the cash on Google's balance sheet.
We are telling these companies, "The smart thing to do, the shareholder-driven thing to do, is to lie and to cheat."
We are issuing 25-cent parking tickets on a meter that costs 100 dollars an hour.
The smart thing to do is lie.
Job destruction!
Amazon only needs one person for two at Macy's.
If they grow their business 20 billion dollars this year, which they will, we will lose 53,000 cashiers and clerks.
This is nothing unusual; this has happened all through our economy, we've just never seen companies this good at it.
That's one Yankee Stadium of workers.
It's even worse in media.
If Facebook and Google grow their businesses 22 billion dollars this year, which they will, we're going to lose approximately 150,000 creative directors, planners and copywriters.
Or we can fill up two-and-a-half Yankee Stadiums and say, "You are out of work, courtesy of Amazon."
We now get the majority of our news from our social media feeds, and the majority of our news coming off of social media feeds is ...
fake news.
(Laughter) I am not allowed to be political or use curse words, or talk about religion in class, so I can definitely not say, "Zuckerberg has become Putin's bitch."
I definitely cannot say that.
(Laughter) Their defense: "Facebook is not a media company; it's a technology company."
You create original content, you pay sports leagues to give you original content, you run advertising against it -- boom! -- you're a media company.
Just in the last few days, Sheryl Sandberg has repeated this lie, that "We are not a media company."
Facebook has openly embraced the margins of celebrity and the influence of a media company yet seems to be allergic to the responsibilities of a media company.
Imagine McDonald's.
We find 80 percent of their beef is fake, and it's giving us encephalitis, and we're making terrible decisions.
And we say, "McDonald's, we're pissed off!"
And they say, "Wait, wait -- we're not a fast-food restaurant, we're a fast-food platform."
(Laughter) These companies and CEOs wrap themselves in a neon-blue pink rainbow and blue blanket to create an illusionist trick from their behavior each day, which is more indicative of the spawn of Darth Vader and Ayn Rand.
Why? Because we as progressives are seen as nice but weak.
If Sheryl Sandberg had written a book on gun rights or on the pro-life movement, would they be flying Sheryl to Cannes?
No.
And I'm not doubting their progressive values, but it foots to shareholder value, because we as progressives are seen as weak.
They're so nice -- remember Microsoft?
They didn't seem as nice, and regulators stepped in much earlier than the regulators now, who would never step in on those nice, nice people.
I'm about to get on a plane tonight, and I'm going to have a guy named Roy from TSA molest me.
If I am suspected of a DUI on the way home, I can have blood taken from my person.
But wait! Don't tap into the iPhone -- it's sacred.
This is our new cross.
It shouldn't be the iPhone X, it should be called the "iPhone Cross."
We have our religion; it's Apple.
Our Jesus Christ is Steve Jobs, and we've decided this is holier than our person, our house or our computer.
We have become totally out of control with the gross idolatry of innovation and of youth.
We no longer worship at the altar of character, of kindness, but of innovation and people who create shareholder value.
Amazon has become so powerful in the marketplace, it can conduct Jedi mind tricks.
It can begin damaging other industries just by looking at them.
Nike announces they're distributing on Amazon, their stock goes up, every other footwear stock goes down.
When Amazon stock goes up, the rest of retail stocks go down, because they assume what's good for Amazon is bad for everybody else.
They cut the cost on salmon 33 percent when they acquired Whole Foods.
In between the time they announced the acquisition of Whole Foods and when it closed, Kroger, the largest pure-play grocer in America, shed a third of its value, because Amazon purchased a grocer one-eleventh the size of Kroger.
I got very lucky.
I predicted the acquisition of Whole Foods by Amazon the week before it happened.
This is me boasting; I said this publicly in the media.
This was the largest acquisition in their history, they'd never made an acquisition over a billion, and people asked, "How did you know this?"
So I'm letting this very impressive audience in on the secret.
How did I know this?
I'm going to tell you how I knew.
I bark at Alexa all day long and try to figure out what's going on.
(Scott Galloway) Alexa, buy whole milk.
(Alexa) I couldn't find anything for whole milk, so I've added whole milk to your shopping list.
SG: Then I asked, (SG) Alexa, buy organic foods.
(Alexa) The top search result for organic food is Plum Organics baby food, banana and pumpkin, 12-pack of four ounces each.
It's 15 dollars total.
Would you like to buy it?
SG: And then, as often happens at my age, I got confused.
(SG) Alexa, buy whole foods.
(Alexa) I have purchased the outstanding stock of Whole Foods Incorporated at 42 dollars per share.
I have charged 13.7 billion to your American Express card.
(Laughter) SG: I thought that'd be funnier.
(Laughter) We've personified these companies, and just as when you're really angry over every little thing someone does in your life and relationships, you've got to ask yourself, "What's going on here? Why are we so disappointed in technology?"
I believe it's because the ratio of one-percent pursuit of shareholder value and 99 percent the betterment of humanity that technology used to play has been flipped, and now we're totally focused on shareholder value instead of humanity.
One hundred thousand people came together for the Manhattan Project and literally saved the world.
Technology saved the world.
My mother was a four-year-old Jew living in London at the outset of the war.
If we had not won the footrace towards splitting the atom, would she have survived?
It's unlikely.
Twenty-five years later, the most impressive accomplishment, arguably, ever in all of humankind: put a man on the moon.
Four hundred thirty thousand Canadians, British and Americans came together, again, with very basic technology, and put a man on the moon.
Now we have the 700,000 best and brightest, and these are the best and brightest from the four corners of the earth.
They are literally playing with lasers relative to slingshots, relative to the squirt gun.
They have the GDP of India to work at.
And after studying these companies for 10 years, I know what their mission is.
Is it to organize the world's information?
Is it to connect us?
Is it to create greater comity of man?
It isn't.
I know why we have brought together -- I know that the greatest collection of IQ capital and creativity, that their sole mission is: to sell another fucking Nissan.
My name is Scott Galloway, I teach at NYU, and I appreciate your time.
(Applause) Chris Anderson: Not planned, but you prompted some questions in me, Scott.
(Laughter) That was a spectacular rant.
SG: Is this like Letterman?
When you do well, he calls you onto the couch?
CA: No, no, you're going to the heart of the conversation right now.
Everyone's aware that after years of worshipping Silicon Valley, suddenly the worm has turned and in such a big way.
To some people here, it will just feel like you're piling on, you're kicking the kids who've already been kicked to pieces anyway.
Don't you feel any empathy for them at all?
SG: None whatsoever.
Look, this is the issue: it's not their fault, it's our fault.
They're for-profit companies.
They're not concerned with the condition of our souls.
They're not going to take care of us when we get older.
We have set up a society that values shareholder value over everything, and they're doing what they're supposed to be doing.
But we need to elect people, and we need to force ourselves to force them to be subject to the same scrutiny that the rest of business endures, full stop.
CA: There's another narrative that is arguably equally consistent with the facts, which is that there actually is good intent in much of the leadership -- I won't say everyone, necessarily -- many of the employees.
We all know people who work in those companies, and they still are pretty convincing that their mission is to -- so, the alternative narrative is that there have been unintended consequences here, that the technologies that we're unleashing, the algorithms, that we're attempting to personalize the internet, for example, have A, resulted in weird effects like filter bubbles that we weren't expecting; and B, made themselves vulnerable to weird things like -- oh, I don't know, Russian hackers creating accounts and doing things that we didn't expect.
Isn't the unintended consequence a possibility here?
SG: I don't think -- I'm pretty sure, statistically, they're no less or better people than any other organization that has 100,000 or more people.
I don't think they're bad people.
As a matter of fact, I would argue that there's a lot of very civic-minded, decent leadership.
But this is the issue: when you control 90 percent points of share in a market, search, that is now bigger than the entire advertising market of any nation, and you're primarily compensated and trying to develop economic security for you and the families of your employees, to increase that market share, you can't help but leverage all the power at your disposal.
And that is the basis for regulation, and it's the basis for the truism throughout history that power corrupts.
They're not bad people; we've just let them get out of control.
CA: So maybe the case is slightly overstated?
I know at least a bit -- Larry Page, for example, Jeff Bezos -- I don't actually believe they wake up thinking, "I've got to sell a fucking Nissan."
I don't think they think that.
I think they are trying to build something cool, and are probably, in moments of reflection, as horrified that some of the things that have happened as we might be.
So is there a different way of framing this, to say that when your model is advertising, that there are dangers there that you have to take on more explicitly?
SG: I think it's very difficult to set an organization up as we do, to pursue shareholder value above all else.
They're not non-profits.
The reason people go to work there is they want to create economic security for them and their families, mostly first and foremost.
And when you get to a point where you control so much economic power, you use all the weapons at your disposal.
I don't think they're bad people, but I think the role of government and the role of us as consumers and people who elect our officials is to ensure that there are some checks here.
And we have given them the mother of all hall passes because we find them just so fascinating.
CA: Scott, eloquently put, spectacularly put.
Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, Tim Cook, if you're watching, you're welcome to come and make the counterargument as well.
Scott, thank you so much.
SG: Thanks very much.
(Applause)
Hello.
It is said that you're asked to come and give a TEDx talk twice in your career: once on the way up, and once on the way down.
(Laughter) And may I say, "It's great to be back."
(Laughter) Laughter - that is our theme today.
Laughter - I may not be able to produce much of it, but will try to shine some light on it, and ask the question: what is it, and what is its role in our lives and in our society?
I want to tell you four jokes today.
That's pretty much it.
I'm going to tell you four jokes, and we will derive whatever lessons we may from these four jokes.
Before I tell you the first joke, as we are in Munich, I'd like to conduct a little experiment.
Some terrible things are said about the German sense of humor specifically that you don't have one.
(Laughter) And I'd like to put this horrible assumption to the test and do an experiment.
So when I tell this first joke, I would ask that only the German people here respond.
(Laughter) To either laugh or not laugh, as you see fit.
But please, don't force yourself to laugh to skew the results.
(Laughter) This is a scientific experiment, it's terribly serious.
So here is the first joke.
There is a man, he is dying in his bed in his home (Laughter) and he smells, coming from the kitchen, the most sublime smell.
It's the smell of his favorite chocolate chip cookies.
And with his last strength, he gets out of bed, and he goes to the kitchen, where his wife of 50 years, is cooking these beautiful chocolate chip cookies.
And they are on a plate of four of them, just out of the oven.
And with his last human strength, he reaches over to take one of the biscuits, and his wife sees him, she rushes over, she slaps his hand, and she says, "No, they are for the funeral."
(Laughter) Newsflash, "TEDx talks reveals finally that the Germans have a sense of humor.
(Laughter) So, now a statement, here is a statement for you: those who lose the power to laugh, lose the power to think.
If you lose the power to laugh, you lose the power to think.
If I can put that another way, the smartest people I know in the world are the funniest.
The smarter they are, the funnier.
And why should that be?
For me, the answer is that seriousness is not the correct response to the absurdity of life.
The human comedy that would create beings, such as we, who are sophisticated enough to ask the huge questions, "Why are we here?", "Who are we?", but be really forever denied an answer and left in a state of existential tension which we seek to relieve in various ways, and one of these, the most effective for me is laughter.
Two old couples are walking down the street.
Two women are walking in front of the two men, and one of the men says to the other, "What did you do last night?"
And the second man says, "Oh, I went to this restaurant.
It was amazing.
The food was fantastic, and the prices were great.
Absolutely super."
And the first one says, "Wow, sounds great.
What was the name of the restaurant?"
And the second man says, "Oh!
What's the name of that flower that smells great?
It's red, and on the stems, there are little thorns."
And the first men says, "Well, that would be the rose."
And the second man says, "Of course."
"Rose, what was the name of that restaurant we went to last night?"
(Laughter) (Applause) For me, that joke is as priceless as a painting by Monet or a sonnet by Shakespeare.
For me, laughter has always been extremely important.
Seriousness - I hope you will agree with this statement - seriousness is dangerous.
Seriousness is dangerous, not just for ourselves but also in society.
And why should that be?
I think, it's partly that seriousness, the forces of seriousness, of humorlessness, would limit us to narrow thinking, rigid ideology, cruelty, and a tunnel vision whereas humor obliges us to have an open mind.
It obliges empathy and forgiveness.
Humor always forgives.
The relationship between humor and seriousness has long been understood.
Winston Churchill, a famous wit, once said, "You cannot hope to understand the most serious things in life, unless you understand the most humorous."
The American Civil Rights activist Clarence Darrow wrote, "If you lose the power to laugh, you lose the power to think."
If you lose the power to laugh, you lose the power to think.
These two men were dealing with politics at a very, very high level, and they knew very well that sometimes only humor can break down entrenched positions and rigid ideology.
There was a flight, a Lufthansa flight from Munich to New York.
The flight was going very well.
It was almost in New York, and then there was a tremendous explosion from the right wing of the aircraft, and the captain's voice came over the speaker, and he said, (with German accent) "Ladies and gentlemen, please, we have a problem with the number three engine on the right wing of the aircraft.
Please do not panic, we have four engines on this aircraft.
We have... (explosion sound) We also now have a problem with the number one engine, but we have two very good... (explosion sound) We have one engine, but I assure you the pilot is most capable of flying the aircraft with only...
(explosion sound) Ladies and gentlemen, we're about to make a landing on the water.
(Laughter) I will speak to you from the water. Please do not panic."
The Lufthansa pilot, of course, makes a spectacular landing on the water.
And then, the captain's voice comes over the speaker again, and he says, "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for following my instructions.
Now, please listen very, very carefully to what I am about to say.
All those of you who can swim, please line up on the right wing of the aircraft.
All those of you who cannot swim, line up on the left wing of the aircraft, and I will speak to you from the water."
So they do everything he says, and they see finally a little captain in a rubber boat rowing to the front of the aircraft, and he has a loudspeaker, and he says, "Ladies and gentlemen, again, I congratulate you for following my instructions.
Now please listen carefully to what I am about to say.
First, those of you on the right wing of the aircraft, New York is this way.
(Laughter) It is only three nautical miles, the water is warm, and the current is with you.
Good luck.
Those of you on the left wing of the aircraft, 'Thank you for flying Lufthansa.'" (Laughter) (Applause) Why do we laugh? Why did you just laugh?
Why do any of us laugh?
Well, this question has perplexed philosophers for thousands of years.
And the best of them: Plato, Freud, Wittgenstein, Nietzsche.
Here is what they came up with.
They said that the reason we laugh is our ancient response to the passing of animal danger.
That's the best they could come up with, that we laugh because it's our ancient response to the passing of animal danger, from which I think, people, we could conclude that asking a philosopher to define comedy is like asking Stevie Wonder to help you find your car keys.
(Laughter) Just as you cannot have a mathematical proof that isn't built from pure mathematics, you cannot have a theory of laughter that isn't funny.
So let's try again.
Let's try here today to define comedy, better than Plato, and Nietzsche, and Freud.
I've looked around for the oldest joke I could find, and I found one.
It's 1,000 years old.
At the end of the first millennium, this was knocking them dead (Laughter) and it goes like this.
There was a funeral in a church.
You have to imagine a medieval church, and everyone is weeping in great tears, except one man.
And the priest notices that one man isn't crying, and at the end of the service, the priest goes up to the one man, and he says, "Did you know the dead man?"
The men says, "Yes, I did."
And he said, "Well, why aren't you crying?"
And he said, "Well, I would have, but I don't belong to this parish."
You'll have to accept that 1,000 years ago that was a killer.
(Laughter) But it does teach us something interesting about comedy: that to understand a joke, you have to belong to the parish.
Let me tell you what I mean.
To understand a joke, you have to belong to the parish, that community of understanding, and if you feel you belong to that community of understanding, of getting the joke, then you will laugh at almost anything that reinforces your sense of belonging to that group.
Jokes connect us, they embrace us.
And in sheer gratitude for that embrace, our mouths open, our chests fill with air, and our bodies do something utterly extraordinary: they make a noise that no other creature has, or will ever make in the entire history of the universe -- laughter.
And what a privilege it is to be able to make someone else laugh.
So when you make someone else laugh, you're not just being funny.
It's not a trivial thing.
You are inducers of hope, embracers of strangers, eradicators of hopelessness, you are physicians, and peacemakers.
I'd like to read you a little statement.
It's a quote, and I wrote it down.
It goes like this, "Comedy is the clash of one point of view colliding with another, one sensibility with another, high with low, East with West, light with dark, old with the young; a collision of two worldviews of two civilizations; and like two pieces of flint being struck together, a life-saving spark is given off and with this spark, you can light a fire."
I thought that was a wonderful quote. I wrote it this morning.
(Laughter) I'd like to give you an example of how humor can be used to break down rigid thinking and entrenched positions.
In 1995, during the Second Intifada, Palestinian Intifada, I was in London, and I went to see the great Jewish comedian Jackie Mason.
Terrific, very controversial in some of his comments.
He was doing his normal show, very funny, and then at one point he said, he wanted to become very serious, and of course, if you know Jackie Mason, the audience became very anxious that Jackie would say one of his very controversial things, and, in fact, he did.
He said, "I want to speak about the Palestinian question," and you could feel the tension in the audience rose tremendously.
And he said - this is what he said.
He said, "I believe that Benjamin Netanyahu wants peace.
I believe this.
In fact, I think he would give back the West Bank to the Palestinian people this very day, this very day; but he can't, because it's already in his wife's name."
(Laughter) And the laughter in this primarily Jewish audience was so pronounced, it went on for five minutes.
It was hysterical.
And in that five minutes, you couldn't help but feel that the possibility of peace had been advanced in some way, that somehow, compromise was just a little closer at hand, and that's what laughter can do.
If we can laugh together, we can live together.
You know what I think the secret of life is?
Some people would say, it's knowledge, but for me we don't seem to learn very much in our human evolution.
History is a wonderful teacher, but we seem to be very poor students.
For me, I think, it's laughter.
Laughter, the husband of truth, the arch enemy of dogma, transmuting the dross of existence into gold.
Someone asked me recently, "How do you want to die? Do you have any ideas?"
And I thought for a moment, and I said, "I think I want to die like my father did, quietly, in his sleep, not screaming like his passengers."
(Laughter) The final line of any joke is called the punchline in English, and in German, in "Deutsch" I believe, it's "die Poente."
It's the line where the miracle happens; the line where we're surprised by something that is revealed, and from that surprise is released joy.
And my parting wish for you all here today is that your own life be a joke.
(Laughter) Yes, I want all your lives to be a joke, and that they have punchlines; that they have (German) "die Poente," as good as "No, they are for the funeral," "It's already in his wife's name," "Not screaming like his passengers," and "Thank you for flying Lufthansa."
Stay funny. Keep laughing. Peace.
(Applause)
'Theme and variations' is one of those forms that require a certain kind of intellectual activity, because you are always comparing the variation with the theme that you hold in your mind.
You might say that the theme is nature and everything that follows is a variation on the subject.
I was asked, I guess about six years ago, to do a series of paintings that in some way would celebrate the birth of Piero della Francesca.
And it was very difficult for me to imagine how to paint pictures that were based on Piero until I realized that I could look at Piero as nature -- that I would have the same attitude towards looking at Piero della Francesca as I would if I were looking out a window at a tree.
And that was enormously liberating to me.
Perhaps it's not a very insightful observation, but that really started me on a path to be able to do a kind of theme and variations based on a work by Piero, in this case that remarkable painting that's in the Uffizi, "The Duke of Montefeltro," who faces his consort, Battista.
Once I realized that I could take some liberties with the subject, I did the following series of drawings.
That's the real Piero della Francesca -- one of the greatest portraits in human history.
And these, I'll just show these without comment.
It's just a series of variations on the head of the Duke of Montefeltro, who's a great, great figure in the Renaissance, and probably the basis for Machiavelli's "The Prince."
He apparently lost an eye in battle, which is why he is always shown in profile.
And this is Battista.
And then I decided I could move them around a little bit -- so that for the first time in history, they're facing the same direction.
Whoops! Passed each other.
And then a visitor from another painting by Piero, this is from "The Resurrection of Christ" -- as though the cast had just gotten of the set to have a chat.
And now, four large panels: this is upper left; upper right; lower left; lower right.
Incidentally, I've never understood the conflict between abstraction and naturalism.
Since all paintings are inherently abstract to begin with there doesn't seem to be an argument there.
On another subject -- (Laughter) -- I was driving in the country one day with my wife, and I saw this sign, and I said, "That is a fabulous piece of design."
And she said, "What are you talking about?"
I said, "Well, it's so persuasive, because the purpose of that sign is to get you into the garage, and since most people are so suspicious of garages, and know that they're going to be ripped off, they use the word 'reliable.' But everybody says they're reliable.
But, reliable Dutchman" -- (Laughter) -- "Fantastic!"
Because as soon as you hear the word Dutchman -- which is an archaic word, nobody calls Dutch people "Dutchmen" anymore -- but as soon as you hear Dutchman, you get this picture of the kid with his finger in the dike, preventing the thing from falling and flooding Holland, and so on.
And so the entire issue is detoxified by the use of "Dutchman."
Now, if you think I'm exaggerating at all in this, all you have to do is substitute something else, like "Indonesian."
(Laughter) Or even "French."
(Laughter) Now, "Swiss" works, but you know it's going to cost a lot of money.
(Laughter) I'm going to take you quickly through the actual process of doing a poster.
I do a lot of work for the School of Visual Arts, where I teach, and the director of this school -- a remarkable man named Silas Rhodes -- often gives you a piece of text and he says, "Do something with this."
And so he did.
And this was the text -- "In words as fashion the same rule will hold/ Alike fantastic if too new or old/ Be not the first by whom the new are tried/ Nor yet the last to lay the old aside."
I could make nothing of that.
And I really struggled with this one.
And the first thing I did, which was sort of in the absence of another idea, was say I'll sort of write it out and make some words big, and I'll have some kind of design on the back somehow, and I was hoping -- as one often does -- to stumble into something.
So I took another crack at it -- you've got to keep it moving -- and I Xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper and I pasted them down on an ugly board.
I thought that something would come out of it, like "Words rule fantastic new old first last Pope" because it's by Alexander Pope, but I sort of made a mess out of it, and then I thought I'd repeat it in some way so it was legible.
So, it was going nowhere.
Sometimes, in the middle of a resistant problem, I write down things that I know about it.
But you can see the beginning of an idea there, because you can see the word "new" emerging from the "old."
That's what happens.
There's a relationship between the old and the new; the new emerges from the context of the old.
And then I did some variations of it, but it still wasn't coalescing graphically at all.
I had this other version which had something interesting about it in terms of being able to put it together in your mind from clues.
The W was clearly a W, the N was clearly an N, even though they were very fragmentary and there wasn't a lot of information in it.
Then I got the words "new" and "old" and now I had regressed back to a point where there seemed to be no return.
(Laughter) I was really desperate at this point.
And so, I do something I'm truthfully ashamed of, which is that I took two drawings I had made for another purpose and I put them together.
It says "dreams" at the top.
And I was going to do a thing, I say, "Well, change the copy.
Let it say something about dreams, and come to SVA and you'll sort of fulfill your dreams."
But, to my credit, I was so embarrassed about doing that that I never submitted this sketch.
And, finally, I arrived at the following solution.
Now, it doesn't look terribly interesting, but it does have something that distinguishes it from a lot of other posters.
For one thing, it transgresses the idea of what a poster's supposed to be, which is to be understood and seen immediately, and not explained.
I remember hearing all of you in the graphic arts -- "If you have to explain it, it ain't working."
And one day I woke up and I said, "Well, suppose that's not true?"
(Laughter) So here's what it says in my explanation at the bottom left.
It says, "Thoughts: This poem is impossible.
Silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations.
This one generates no imagery at all."
I am now exposing myself to my audience, right?
Which is something you never want to do professionally.
"Maybe the words can make the image without anything else happening.
What's the heart of this poem?
Don't be trendy if you want to be serious.
Is doing the poster this way trendy in itself?
I guess one could reduce the idea further by suggesting that the new emerges behind and through the old, like this."
And then I show you a little drawing -- you see, you remember that old thing I discarded?
Well, I found a way to use it.
So, there's that little alternative over there, and I say, "Not bad," -- criticizing myself -- "but more didactic than visual.
Maybe what wants to be said is that old and the new are locked in a dialectical embrace, a kind of dance where each defines the other."
And then more self-questioning -- "Am I being simple-minded?
Is this the kind of simple that looks obvious, or the kind that looks profound?
There's a significant difference.
This could be embarrassing.
Actually, I realize fear of embarrassment drives me as much as any ambition.
Do you think this sort of thing could really attract a student to the school?"
(Laughter) Well, I think there are two fresh things here -- two fresh things.
One is the sort of willingness to expose myself to a critical audience, and not to suggest that I am confident about what I'm doing.
And as you know, you have to have a front.
I mean -- you've got to be confident; if you don't believe in your work, who else is going to believe in it?
So that's one thing, to introduce the idea of doubt into graphics.
That can be a big contribution.
The other thing is to actually give you two solutions for the price of one; you get the big one and if you don't like that, how about the little one?
(Laughter) And that too is a relatively new idea.
And here's just a series of experiments where I ask the question of -- does a poster have to be square?
Now, this is a little illusion.
That poster is not folded.
It's not folded, that's a photograph and it's cut on the diagonal.
Same cheap trick in the upper left-hand corner.
And here, a very peculiar poster because, simply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer, it won't sit still in the space.
At times, it seems to be wider at the back than the front, and then it shifts.
And if you sit here long enough, it'll float off the page into the audience.
But, we don't have time.
(Laughter) And then an experiment -- a little bit about the nature of perspective, where the outside shape is determined by the peculiarity of perspective, but the shape of the bottle -- which is identical to the outside shape -- is seen frontally.
And another piece for the art directors' club is "Anna Rees" casting long shadows.
This is another poster from the School of Visual Arts.
There were 10 artists invited to participate in it, and it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive and I didn't want to be embarrassed, so I worked very hard on this.
The idea was -- and it was a brilliant idea -- was to have 10 posters distributed throughout the city's subway system so every time you got on the subway you'd be passing a different poster, all of which had a different idea of what art is.
But I was absolutely stuck on the idea of "art is" and trying to determine what art was.
But then I gave up and I said, "Well, art is whatever."
And as soon as I said that, I discovered that the word "hat" was hidden in the word "whatever," and that led me to the inevitable conclusion.
But then again, it's on my list of didactic posters.
My intent is to have a literary accompaniment that explains the poster, in case you don't get it.
(Laughter) Now this says, "Note to the viewer: I thought I might use a visual cliche of our time -- Magritte's everyman -- to express the idea that art is mystery, continuity and history.
I'm also convinced that, in an age of computer manipulation, surrealism has become banal, a shadow of its former self.
The phrase 'Art is whatever' expresses the current inclusiveness that surrounds art-making -- a sort of 'it ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it' notion.
The shadow of Magritte falls across the central part of the poster a poetic event that occurs as the shadow man isolates the word 'hat,' hidden in the word 'whatever.' The four hats shown in the poster suggests how art might be defined: as a thing itself, the worth of the thing, the shadow of the thing, and the shape of the thing.
Whatever."
(Applause) OK.
(Applause) And the one that I did not submit, which I still like, I wanted to use the same phrase.
There were wonderful experiments by Bruno Munari on letterforms some years ago -- sort of, see how far you could go and still be able to read them.
And that idea stuck in my head.
But then I took the pieces that I had taken off and put them at the bottom.
And, of course those are the remains, and they're so labeled.
But what really happens is that you read it as: "Art is whatever remains."
Thank you.
(Applause)
Pablo Neruda published his first collection of poems at age 19.
He went on to win the Nobel Prize in Literature— and also rescue 2,000 refugees, spend three years in political exile, and run for president of Chile.
A romantic and a revolutionary, Neruda was one of the most celebrated poets of the 20th century, but also one of the most accessible and controversial.
Originally written in Spanish, his poems often use straightforward language and everyday experience to create lasting impact.
Neruda was born Ricardo Eliezer Neftalí Reyes Basoalto in a small Chilean town in 1904.
His father didn’t want him to be a poet, so at sixteen he began to write under the pen name “Pablo Neruda.” The poems in his early collection "Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair" were tender and perceptive, illuminating the subtleties of love and enchantment.
In "Poem VI," for example, he writes: “Tu recuerdo es de luz, de humo, de estanque en calma!/ Más allá de tus ojos ardían los crepúsculos.” Later, he poured this attention to detail into poems of appreciation for everyday objects.
Many of the 225 short poems in his collection "All the Odes" are dedicated to the assortment of small, apparently insignificant items that surround us, from a pair of shoelaces to a watermelon.
An onion is más hermosa que un ave/ de plumas cegadoras, while a tuna in the market is a bala del profundo/ océano, proyectil natatorio, te vi, muerto.
Despite this early literary success, Neruda struggled financially, and took a series of diplomatic jobs in places such as Burma, Indonesia, Singapore and Spain.
In 1936, while Neruda was working at the consulate in Madrid, civil war broke out and the government was overthrown by a fascist military dictatorship.
Neruda organized an evacuation of refugees from Spain to Chile, saving 2,000 lives.
Over a period of twenty years, Neruda captured his experiences abroad in a three volume poetry collection titled "Residence on Earth."
Many of these poems were experimental and surreal, merging epic landscapes, supernatural themes, and feelings of longing with discussion of political strife and a poet’s responsibility to speak out against injustice.
In “I Explain a Few Things” he lingers on haunting details of the destruction of the Spanish Civil War.
For the rest of his life, Neruda remained committed to revolutionary ideals.
His politics led to several years of exile before he was able to return to Chile in 1952.
While in exile, he published his influential "Canto General."
The book attempts to retell the entire history of Latin America through poetry, touching on everything from its flora and fauna to its politics and wars, but above all paying homage to the common people behind its civilizations’ achievements.
Although he continued to travel, after returning from exile Neruda lived in Chile for the rest of his life.
In 1970, at age 66, Neruda ran for president of Chile before yielding to Salvador Allende and becoming his close advisor.
But in 1973, Allende was overthrown in a military coup by General Augusto Pinochet.
Neruda died in the hospital a couple of weeks later.
Because of the timing of his death so soon after the coup, rumors swirled that he had died of sadness or even been assassinated, but the hospital recorded his cause of death as cancer.
Today, Neruda’s lines are recited at protests and marches worldwide.
Much like his life, Neruda’s poems bridged romance and revolution by emphasizing the everyday moments worth fighting for.
In the middle of the 16th century, a talented young anatomist named Andreas Vesalius made a shocking discovery: the most famous human anatomy texts in the world were wrong.
They not only failed to account for many details of the human body, they also described the organs of apes and other mammals.
While Vesalius knew he was right, announcing these errors would mean challenging Galen of Pergamon– the most renowned physician in medical history.
But who was this towering figure?
And why did doctors working more than 1,300 years later so revere and fear him?
Born in 129 CE, Galen left home as a teen to scour the Mediterranean for medical wisdom.
He returned home a gifted surgeon with a passion for anatomy and a penchant for showmanship.
He gleefully entered public anatomy contests, eager to show up his fellow physicians.
In one demonstration, he caused a pig to lose its voice by tying off one of its nerves.
In another, he disemboweled a monkey and challenged his colleagues to repair it.
When they couldn’t, he did.
These grizzly feats won him a position as surgeon to the city’s gladiators.
Eventually, he would leave the arena to become the personal physician to four Roman Emperors.
While his peers debated symptoms and their origins, Galen obsessively studied anatomy.
He was convinced that each organ had a specific function.
Since the Roman government largely prohibited working with human cadavers, Galen conducted countless dissections of animals instead.
Even with this constraint, his exhaustive investigations yielded some remarkably accurate conclusions.
One of Galen’s most important contributions was the insight that the brain, not the heart, controlled the body.
He confirmed this theory by opening the cranium of a living cow.
By applying pressure to different parts of the brain, he could link various regions to specific functions.
Other experiments allowed him to distinguish sensory from motor nerves, establish that urine was made in the kidneys, and deduce that respiration was controlled by muscles and nerves.
But these wild experiments also produced extraordinary misconceptions.
Galen never realized that blood cycles continuously throughout the body.
Instead, he believed the liver constantly produces an endless supply of blood, which gets entirely depleted on its one-way trip to the organs.
Galen is also credited with solidifying the popular theory of the Four Humours.
Introduced by Hippocrates centuries earlier, this misguided hypothesis attributed most medical problems to an imbalance in four bodily fluids called humours.
To correct the balance of these fluids, doctors employed dangerous treatments like bloodletting and purging.
Informed by his poor understanding of the circulatory system, Galen was a strong proponent of these treatments, despite their sometimes lethal consequences.
Unfortunately, Galen’s ego drove him to believe that all his discoveries were of the utmost importance.
He penned treatises on everything from anatomy to nutrition to bedside manner, meticulously cataloguing his writings to ensure their preservation.
Over the next 13 centuries, Galen’s prolific collection dominated all other schools of medical thought.
His texts became the standard works taught to new generations of doctors, who in turn, wrote new essays extolling Galen’s ideas.
Even doctors who actually dissected human cadavers would bafflingly repeat Galen’s mistakes, despite seeing clear evidence to the contrary.
Meanwhile, the few practitioners bold enough to offer conflicting opinions were either ignored or ridiculed.
For 1,300 years, Galen’s legacy remained untouchable– until renaissance anatomist Vesalius spoke out against him.
As a prominent scientist and lecturer, his authority influenced many young doctors of his time.
But even then, it took another hundred years for an accurate description of blood flow to emerge, and two hundred more for the theory of the Four Humours to fade.
Hopefully, today we can reap the benefits of Galen’s experiments without attributing equal credence to his less accurate ideas.
But perhaps just as valuable is the reminder that science is an ever-evolving process, which should always place evidence above ego.
Meet Odontochelys semitestacea.
This little creature spends its days splashing in Late Triassic swamps with a host of other reptiles.
Under the surface lies its best defense against attack: a hard shell on its belly.
Odontochelys is an early ancestor of the turtle.
Its half-shelled body illustrates an important point about the modern turtle: it actually has two shells that develop totally separately while the turtle is still an embryo.
Both are extensions of the animal’s skeleton, and together they are made of almost 60 bones.
Like other embryos, turtle embryos are made of undifferentiated cells that become specific cell types, and then organs and tissues, through gene activity and communication between cells.
At first, turtle embryos look very similar to those of other reptiles, birds, and mammals, except for a bulge of cells called the carapacial ridge.
The ridge expands around the body between the neck and lower back, creating a disc shape.
It guides the formation of the upper part of the turtle’s shell, called the carapace, likely by attracting the cells that will become ribs.
Instead of curving downwards to make a regular rib cage, the ribs move outwards towards the carapacial ridge.
They then secrete a signaling protein that converts surrounding cells into bone-forming cells.
These fifty bones grow until they meet and connect with sutures.
A ring of bone solidifies the carapace’s edges.
The outer layer of skin cells produces the scales, known as scutes, that cover the carapace.
The development of the bottom half of the shell, the plastron, is driven by neural crest cells, which can produce a variety of different cell types including neurons, cartilage and bone.
A thick shield of these cells spreads across the belly, coming together in regions that produce nine plate-like bones.
Eventually, these connect to the carapace by sutures.
A turtle’s shell has obvious advantages for guarding against predators, but the rigid casing also presents some challenges.
As the turtle grows, the sutures between the bones of the carapace and plastron spread.
Most mammals and reptiles rely on a flexible rib cage that expands to allow them to breathe, but turtles use abdominal muscles attached to the shell instead: one to breathe in, and one to breathe out.
So how did the shell evolve?
Though there are still gaps in the fossil record, the first step seems to have been a thickening of the ribs.
The oldest known turtle ancestor, a creature called Eunotosaurus africanus, lived 260 million years ago and looked almost nothing like a modern turtle, but it had a set of broad, flat ribs that anchored the muscles of its powerful forearms.
Eunotosaurus was likely a burrowing creature, digging homes for itself in what’s now southern Africa.
Odontochelys semitestacea illustrates another, later step in turtle evolution, with thick ribs like Eunotosaurus plus a belly plate for protection.
Our first fossil evidence of the full shell characteristic of modern turtles is about 210 million years old, and belongs to a species called Proganochelys quenstedti, whose ribs had fused.
Proganochelys could move between water and land.
Unlike modern turtles, it couldn’t retract its head into its shell, but had defensive spines on its neck.
Modern turtle shells are almost as diverse as the turtles themselves.
Sea turtles have flatter, lighter shells for streamlined gliding through the water.
Land-dwelling tortoises, meanwhile, have domed shells that can slip free of predators’ jaws and help them turn right-side up if they fall on their backs.
Leatherback and softshell turtles have shells without the ring of bone around the edge of the carapace or the tough scutes covering it, making it easier for them to squeeze into tight spaces.
I've been a police officer in an urban city for nearly 25 years.
That's crazy, right?
And in that time, I've served in every rank, from police officer to police chief.
A few years ago, I noticed something alarming.
Starting in 2014, I started monitoring recruits as they cycled through police academies in the state of New Jersey, and I found that women were failing at rates between 65 and 80 percent, due to varying aspects of the physical fitness test.
I learned that a change in policy now required recruits to pass the fitness exam within 10 short workout sessions.
This had the greatest impact on women.
The change meant that recruits had about three weeks out of a five-month-long academy to pass the fitness exam.
This just didn't make sense, though.
Police agencies and police recruits had made huge investments to get those recruits into the academy.
Police recruits had passed lengthy background checks, they had passed medical and psychological exams, they had quit their jobs.
And many had spent more than 2,000 dollars in fees and equipment just to get kicked out within the first three weeks?
The dire situation in New Jersey led me to examine the status of women in policing across the United States.
I found that women make up less than 13 percent of police officers.
A number that hasn't changed much in the past 20 years.
And they make up just three percent of police chiefs as of 2013, the last time the data was collected.
We know that we can improve those rates.
Other countries like Canada, Australia and the UK have nearly twice the amount of policewomen.
And New Zealand is steadily marching towards their goal of recruit gender parity by 2021.
Other countries are actively working to increase the number of women in policing, because they know of a vast body of research evidence, spanning more than 50 years, detailing the advantages to women in policing.
From that research, we know that policewomen are less likely to use force or to be accused of excessive force.
We know that policewomen are less likely to be named in a lawsuit or a citizen complaint.
We know that the mere presence of a policewoman reduces the use of force among other officers.
And we know that policewomen are met with the same rates of force as their male counterparts, and sometimes more, and yet they're more successful in defusing violent or aggressive behavior overall.
So there are vast advantages to women in policing, and we're losing them to arbitrary fitness standards.
The problem is, the United States has nearly 18,000 police agencies -- 18,000 agencies with wildly varying fitness standards.
We know that a majority of academies rely on a masculine ideal of policing that works to decrease the number of women in policing.
These types of academies overemphasize physical strength, with much less attention spent to subjects like community policing, problem-solving and interpersonal communication skills.
This results in training that does not mirror the realities of policing.
Physical agility is but a small component of police work.
Much of an officer's day is spent mediating interpersonal conflicts.
That's the reality of policing.
These are my babies.
And we can reduce the disparity in policing by changing exams that produce disparate outcomes.
The federal courts have stated that men and women simply are not physiologically the same for the purposes of physical fitness programs.
And that's based on science.
Respected institutions that law enforcement deeply respects, like the FBI, the US Marshals Service, the DEA and even the US military -- they rigorously test fitness programs to ensure they measure fitness without gender-disparate outcomes.
Why is that?
Because recruiting is expensive.
They want to recruit and retain qualified candidates.
You know what else the research finds?
Well-trained women are as capable as their male counterparts in overall fitness, but more importantly, in how they police.
The law-enforcement community is admittedly experiencing a recruitment crisis.
Yet, if they truly want to increase the number of applicants, they can.
We can easily recruit more women and reap all those research benefits by training well-qualified candidates to pass validated, work-related, physiologically-based fitness exams, as required by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.
We can increase the number of women, we can reduce that gender disparity, by simply changing exams that produce disparate outcomes.
We have the tools.
We have the research, we have the science, we have the law.
This, my friends, should be a very easy fix.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So in the winter of 2012, I went to visit my grandmother's house in South India, a place, by the way, where the mosquitos have a special taste for the blood of the American-born.
(Laughter) No joke.
When I was there, I got an unexpected gift.
It was this antique instrument made more than a century ago, hand-carved from a rare wood, inlaid with pearls and with dozens of metal strings.
It's a family heirloom, a link between my past, the country where my parents were born, and the future, the unknown places I'll take it.
I didn't actually realize it at the time I got it, but it would later become a powerful metaphor for my work.
We all know the saying, "There's no time like the present."
But nowadays, it can feel like there's no time but the present.
What's immediate and ephemeral seems to dominate our lives, our economy and our politics.
It's so easy to get caught up in the number of steps we took today or the latest tweet from a high-profile figure.
It's easy for businesses to get caught up in making immediate profits and neglect what's good for future invention.
And it's far too easy for governments to stand by while fisheries and farmland are depleted instead of conserved to feed future generations.
I have a feeling that, at this rate, it's going to be hard for our generation to be remembered as good ancestors.
If you think about it, our species evolved to think ahead, to chart the stars, dream of the afterlife, sow seeds for later harvest.
Some scientists call this superpower that we have "mental time travel," and it's responsible for pretty much everything we call human civilization, from farming to the Magna Carta to the internet -- all first conjured in the minds of humans.
But let's get real: if we look around us today, we don't exactly seem to be using this superpower quite enough, and that begs the question: Why not?
What's wrong is how our communities, businesses and institutions are designed.
They're designed in a way that's impairing our foresight.
I want to talk to you about the three key mistakes that I think we're making.
The first mistake is what we measure.
When we look at the quarterly profits of a company or its near-term stock price, that's often not a great measure of whether that company is going to grow its market share or be inventive in the long run.
When we glue ourselves to the test scores that kids bring back from school, that's not necessarily what's great for those kids' learning and curiosity in the long run.
We're not measuring what really matters in the future.
The second mistake we're making that impairs our foresight is what we reward.
When we celebrate a political leader or a business leader for the disaster she just cleaned up or the announcement she just made, we're not motivating that leader to invest in preventing those disasters in the first place, or to put down payments on the future by protecting communities from floods or fighting inequality or investing in research and education.
The third mistake that impairs our foresight is what we fail to imagine.
Now, when we do think about the future, we tend to focus on predicting exactly what's next, whether we're using horoscopes or algorithms to do that.
But we spend a lot less time imagining all the possibilities the future holds.
When the Ebola outbreak emerged in 2014 in West Africa, public health officials around the world had early warning signs and predictive tools that showed how that outbreak might spread, but they failed to fathom that it would, and they failed to act in time to intervene, and the epidemic grew to kill more than 11,000 people.
When people with lots of resources and good forecasts don't prepare for deadly hurricanes, they're often failing to imagine how dangerous they can be.
Now, none of these mistakes that I've described, as dismal as they might sound, are inevitable.
In fact, they're all avoidable.
What we need to make better decisions about the future are tools that can aid our foresight, tools that can help us think ahead.
Think of these as something like the telescopes that ship captains of yore used when they scanned the horizon.
Only instead of for looking across distance and the ocean, these tools are for looking across time to the future.
I want to share with you a few of the tools that I've found in my research that I think can help us with foresight.
The first tool I want to share with you I think of as making the long game pay now.
This is Wes Jackson, a farmer I spent some time with in Kansas.
And Jackson knows that the way that most crops are grown around the world today is stripping the earth of the fertile topsoil we need to feed future generations.
He got together with a group of scientists, and they bred perennial grain crops which have deep roots that anchor the fertile topsoil of a farm, preventing erosion and protecting future harvests.
But they also knew that in order to get farmers to grow these crops in the short run, they needed to boost the annual yields of the crops and find companies willing to make cereal and beer using the grains so that farmers could reap profits today by doing what's good for tomorrow.
And this is a tried-and-true strategy.
In fact, it was used by George Washington Carver in the South of the United States after the Civil War in the early 20th century.
A lot of people have probably heard of Carver's 300 uses for the peanut, the products and recipes that he came up with that made the peanut so popular.
But not everyone knows why Carver did that.
He was trying to help poor Alabama sharecroppers whose cotton yields were declining, and he knew that planting peanuts in their fields would replenish those soils so that their cotton yields would be better a few years later.
But he also knew it needed to be lucrative for them in the short run.
Alright, so let's talk about another tool for foresight.
This one I like to think of as keeping the memory of the past alive to help us imagine the future.
So I went to Fukushima, Japan on the sixth anniversary of the nuclear reactor disaster there that followed the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami of 2011.
When I was there, I learned about the Onagawa Nuclear Power Station, which was even closer to the epicenter of that earthquake than the infamous Fukushima Daiichi that we all know about.
In Onagawa, people in the city actually fled to the nuclear power plant as a place of refuge.
It was that safe.
It was spared by the tsunamis.
It was the foresight of just one engineer, Yanosuke Hirai, that made that happen.
In the 1960s, he fought to build that power plant farther back from the coast at higher elevation and with a higher sea wall.
He knew the story of his hometown shrine, which had flooded in the year 869 after a tsunami.
It was his knowledge of history that allowed him to imagine what others could not.
OK, one more tool of foresight.
This one I think of as creating shared heirlooms.
These are lobster fishermen on the Pacific coast of Mexico, and they're the ones who taught me this.
They have protected their lobster harvest there for nearly a century, and they've done that by treating it as a shared resource that they're passing on to their collected children and grandchildren.
They carefully measure what they catch so that they're not taking the breeding lobster out of the ocean.
Across North America, there are more than 30 fisheries that are doing something vaguely similar to this.
They're creating long-term stakes in the fisheries known as catch shares which get fishermen to be motivated not just in taking whatever they can from the ocean today but in its long-term survival.
Now there are many, many more tools of foresight I would love to share with you, and they come from all kinds of places: investment firms that look beyond near-term stock prices, states that have freed their elections from the immediate interests of campaign financiers.
And we're going to need to marshal as many of these tools as we can if we want to rethink what we measure, change what we reward and be brave enough to imagine what lies ahead.
Not all this is going to be easy, as you can imagine.
Some of these tools we can pick up in our own lives, some we're going to need to do in businesses or in communities, and some we need to do as a society.
The future is worth this effort.
My own inspiration to keep up this effort is the instrument I shared with you.
It's called a dilruba, and it was custom-made for my great-grandfather.
He was a well-known music and art critic in India in the early 20th century.
My great-grandfather had the foresight to protect this instrument at a time when my great-grandmother was pawning off all their belongings, but that's another story.
He protected it by giving it to the next generation, by giving it to my grandmother, and she gave it to me.
When I first heard the sound of this instrument, it haunted me.
It felt like hearing a wanderer in the Himalayan fog.
It felt like hearing a voice from the past.
(Music) (Music ends) That's my friend Simran Singh playing the dilruba.
When I play it, it sounds like a cat's dying somewhere, so you're welcome.
(Laughter) This instrument is in my home today, but it doesn't actually belong to me.
It's my role to shepherd it in time, and that feels more meaningful to me than just owning it for today.
This instrument positions me as both a descendant and an ancestor.
It makes me feel part of a story bigger than my own.
And this, I believe, is the single most powerful way we can reclaim foresight: by seeing ourselves as the good ancestors we long to be, ancestors not just to our own children but to all humanity.
Whatever your heirloom is, however big or small, protect it and know that its music can resonate for generations.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Today, actually, is a very special day for me, because it is my birthday.
(Applause) And so, thanks to all of you for joining the party.
(Laughter) But every time you throw a party, there's someone there to spoil it. Right?
(Laughter) And I'm a physicist, and this time I brought another physicist along to do so.
His name is Albert Einstein -- also Albert -- and he's the one who said that the person who has not made his great contributions to science by the age of 30 will never do so.
(Laughter) Now, you don't need to check Wikipedia that I'm beyond 30.
(Laughter) So, effectively, what he is telling me, and us, is that when it comes to my science, I'm deadwood.
Well, luckily, I had my share of luck within my career.
Around age 28, I became very interested in networks, and a few years later, we managed to publish a few key papers that reported the discovery of scale-free networks and really gave birth to a new discipline that we call network science today.
And if you really care about it, you can get a PhD now in network science in Budapest, in Boston, and you can study it all over the world.
A few years later, when I moved to Harvard first as a sabbatical, I became interested in another type of network: that time, the networks within ourselves, how the genes and the proteins and the metabolites link to each other and how they connect to disease.
And that interest led to a major explosion within medicine, including the Network Medicine Division at Harvard, that has more than 300 researchers who are using this perspective to treat patients and develop new cures.
And a few years ago, I thought that I would take this idea of networks and the expertise we had in networks in a different area, that is, to understand success.
And why did we do that?
Well, we thought that, to some degree, our success is determined by the networks we're part of -- that our networks can push us forward, they can pull us back.
And I was curious if we could use the knowledge and big data and expertise where we develop the networks to really quantify how these things happen.
This is a result from that.
What you see here is a network of galleries in museums that connect to each other.
And through this map that we mapped out last year, we are able to predict very accurately the success of an artist if you give me the first five exhibits that he or she had in their career.
Well, as we thought about success, we realized that success is not only about networks; there are so many other dimensions to that.
And one of the things we need for success, obviously, is performance.
So let's define what's the difference between performance and success.
Well, performance is what you do: how fast you run, what kind of paintings you paint, what kind of papers you publish.
However, in our working definition, success is about what the community notices from what you did, from your performance: How does it acknowledge it, and how does it reward you for it?
In other terms, your performance is about you, but your success is about all of us.
And this was a very important shift for us, because the moment we defined success as being a collective measure that the community provides to us, it became measurable, because if it's in the community, there are multiple data points about that.
So we go to school, we exercise, we practice, because we believe that performance leads to success.
But the way we actually started to explore, we realized that performance and success are very, very different animals when it comes to the mathematics of the problem.
And let me illustrate that.
So what you see here is the fastest man on earth, Usain Bolt.
And of course, he wins most of the competitions that he enters.
And we know he's the fastest on earth because we have a chronometer to measure his speed.
Well, what is interesting about him is that when he wins, he doesn't do so by really significantly outrunning his competition.
He's running at most a percent faster than the one who loses the race.
And not only does he run only one percent faster than the second one, but he doesn't run 10 times faster than I do -- and I'm not a good runner, trust me on that.
(Laughter) And every time we are able to measure performance, we notice something very interesting; that is, performance is bounded.
What it means is that there are no huge variations in human performance.
It varies only in a narrow range, and we do need the chronometer to measure the differences.
This is not to say that we cannot see the good from the best ones, but the best ones are very hard to distinguish.
And the problem with that is that most of us work in areas where we do not have a chronometer to gauge our performance.
Alright, performance is bounded, there are no huge differences between us when it comes to our performance.
How about success?
Well, let's switch to a different topic, like books.
One measure of success for writers is how many people read your work.
And so when my previous book came out in 2009, I was in Europe talking with my editor, and I was interested: Who is the competition?
And I had some fabulous ones.
That week -- (Laughter) Dan Brown came out with "The Lost Symbol," and "The Last Song" also came out, Nicholas Sparks.
And when you just look at the list, you realize, you know, performance-wise, there's hardly any difference between these books or mine.
Right?
So maybe if Nicholas Sparks's team works a little harder, he could easily be number one, because it's almost by accident who ended up at the top.
So I said, let's look at the numbers -- I'm a data person, right?
So let's see what were the sales for Nicholas Sparks.
And it turns out that that opening weekend, Nicholas Sparks sold more than a hundred thousand copies, which is an amazing number.
You can actually get to the top of the "New York Times" best-seller list by selling 10,000 copies a week, so he tenfold overcame what he needed to be number one.
Yet he wasn't number one.
Why?
Because there was Dan Brown, who sold 1.2 million copies that weekend.
(Laughter) And the reason I like this number is because it shows that, really, when it comes to success, it's unbounded, that the best doesn't only get slightly more than the second best but gets orders of magnitude more, because success is a collective measure.
We give it to them, rather than we earn it through our performance.
So one of things we realized is that performance, what we do, is bounded, but success, which is collective, is unbounded, which makes you wonder: How do you get these huge differences in success when you have such tiny differences in performance?
And recently, I published a book that I devoted to that very question.
And they didn't give me enough time to go over all of that, so I'm going to go back to the question of, alright, you have success; when should that appear?
So let's go back to the party spoiler and ask ourselves: Why did Einstein make this ridiculous statement, that only before 30 you could actually be creative?
Well, because he looked around himself and he saw all these fabulous physicists that created quantum mechanics and modern physics, and they were all in their 20s and early 30s when they did so.
And it's not only him.
It's not only observational bias, because there's actually a whole field of genius research that has documented the fact that, if we look at the people we admire from the past and then look at what age they made their biggest contribution, whether that's music, whether that's science, whether that's engineering, most of them tend to do so in their 20s, 30s, early 40s at most.
But there's a problem with this genius research.
Well, first of all, it created the impression to us that creativity equals youth, which is painful, right?
(Laughter) And it also has an observational bias, because it only looks at geniuses and doesn't look at ordinary scientists and doesn't look at all of us and ask, is it really true that creativity vanishes as we age?
So that's exactly what we tried to do, and this is important for that to actually have references.
So let's look at an ordinary scientist like myself, and let's look at my career.
So what you see here is all the papers that I've published from my very first paper, in 1989; I was still in Romania when I did so, till kind of this year.
And vertically, you see the impact of the paper, that is, how many citations, how many other papers have been written that cited that work.
And when you look at that, you see that my career has roughly three different stages.
I had the first 10 years where I had to work a lot and I don't achieve much.
No one seems to care about what I do, right?
There's hardly any impact.
(Laughter) That time, I was doing material science, and then I kind of discovered for myself networks and then started publishing in networks.
And that led from one high-impact paper to the other one.
And it really felt good. That was that stage of my career.
(Laughter) So the question is, what happens right now?
And we don't know, because there hasn't been enough time passed yet to actually figure out how much impact those papers will get; it takes time to acquire.
Well, when you look at the data, it seems to be that Einstein, the genius research, is right, and I'm at that stage of my career.
(Laughter) So we said, OK, let's figure out how does this really happen, first in science.
And in order not to have the selection bias, to look only at geniuses, we ended up reconstructing the career of every single scientist from 1900 till today and finding for all scientists what was their personal best, whether they got the Nobel Prize or they never did, or no one knows what they did, even their personal best.
And that's what you see in this slide.
Each line is a career, and when you have a light blue dot on the top of that career, it says that was their personal best.
And the question is, when did they actually make their biggest discovery?
To quantify that, we look at what's the probability that you make your biggest discovery, let's say, one, two, three or 10 years into your career?
We're not looking at real age.
We're looking at what we call "academic age."
Your academic age starts when you publish your first papers.
I know some of you are still babies.
(Laughter) So let's look at the probability that you publish your highest-impact paper.
And what you see is, indeed, the genius research is right.
Most scientists tend to publish their highest-impact paper in the first 10, 15 years in their career, and it tanks after that.
It tanks so fast that I'm about -- I'm exactly 30 years into my career, and the chance that I will publish a paper that would have a higher impact than anything that I did before is less than one percent.
I am in that stage of my career, according to this data.
But there's a problem with that.
We're not doing controls properly.
So the control would be, what would a scientist look like who makes random contribution to science?
Or what is the productivity of the scientist?
When do they write papers?
So we measured the productivity, and amazingly, the productivity, your likelihood of writing a paper in year one, 10 or 20 in your career, is indistinguishable from the likelihood of having the impact in that part of your career.
And to make a long story short, after lots of statistical tests, there's only one explanation for that, that really, the way we scientists work is that every single paper we write, every project we do, has exactly the same chance of being our personal best.
That is, discovery is like a lottery ticket.
And the more lottery tickets we buy, the higher our chances.
And it happens to be so that most scientists buy most of their lottery tickets in the first 10, 15 years of their career, and after that, their productivity decreases.
They're not buying any more lottery tickets.
So it looks as if they would not be creative.
In reality, they stopped trying.
So when we actually put the data together, the conclusion is very simple: success can come at any time.
It could be your very first or very last paper of your career.
It's totally random in the space of the projects.
It is the productivity that changes.
Let me illustrate that.
Here is Frank Wilczek, who got the Nobel Prize in Physics for the very first paper he ever wrote in his career as a graduate student.
(Laughter) More interesting is John Fenn, who, at age 70, was forcefully retired by Yale University.
They shut his lab down, and at that moment, he moved to Virginia Commonwealth University, opened another lab, and it is there, at age 72, that he published a paper for which, 15 years later, he got the Nobel Prize for Chemistry.
And you think, OK, well, science is special, but what about other areas where we need to be creative?
So let me take another typical example: entrepreneurship.
Silicon Valley, the land of the youth, right?
And indeed, when you look at it, you realize that the biggest awards, the TechCrunch Awards and other awards, are all going to people whose average age is late 20s, very early 30s.
You look at who the VCs give the money to, some of the biggest VC firms -- all people in their early 30s.
Which, of course, we know; there is this ethos in Silicon Valley that youth equals success.
Not when you look at the data, because it's not only about forming a company -- forming a company is like productivity, trying, trying, trying -- when you look at which of these individuals actually put out a successful company, a successful exit.
And recently, some of our colleagues looked at exactly that question.
And it turns out that yes, those in the 20s and 30s put out a huge number of companies, form lots of companies, but most of them go bust.
And when you look at the successful exits, what you see in this particular plot, the older you are, the more likely that you will actually hit the stock market or the sell the company successfully.
This is so strong, actually, that if you are in the 50s, you are twice as likely to actually have a successful exit than if you are in your 30s.
(Applause) So in the end, what is it that we see, actually?
What we see is that creativity has no age.
Productivity does, right?
Which is telling me that at the end of the day, if you keep trying -- (Laughter) you could still succeed and succeed over and over.
So my conclusion is very simple: I am off the stage, back in my lab.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid, playing with blocks.
As you figured out how to reach out and grasp, pick them up and move them around, you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships.
Spatial reasoning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us.
So, as a computer scientist inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects -- along with my adviser Pattie, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi -- I started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer, instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop, what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically, arranging it the way we wanted?
This question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer, by building Siftables.
In a nutshell, a Siftable is an interactive computer the size of a cookie.
They're able to be moved around by hand, they can sense each other, they can sense their motion, and they have a screen and a wireless radio.
Most importantly, they're physical, so like the blocks, you can move them just by reaching out and grasping.
And Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information.
And as these tools become more physical, more aware of their motion, aware of each other, and aware of the nuance of how we move them, we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles.
So, I'm going to start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is configured to show video, and if I tilt it in one direction, it'll roll the video this way; if I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards.
And these interactive portraits are aware of each other.
So if I put them next to each other, they get interested.
If they get surrounded, they notice that too, they might get a little flustered.
And they can also sense their motion and tilt.
One of the interesting implications on interaction, we started to realize, was that we could use everyday gestures on data, like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid.
So in this case, we've got three Siftables configured to be paint buckets and I can use them to pour color into that central one, where they get mixed.
If we overshoot, we can pour a little bit back.
There are also some neat possibilities for education, like language, math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly, and view the results immediately.
So here I'm -- (Applause) This is a Fibonacci sequence that I'm making with a simple equation program.
Here we have a word game that's kind of like a mash-up between Scrabble and Boggle.
Basically, in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each Siftable, and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary.
Then, after about 30 seconds, it reshuffles, and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try.
(Applause) Thank you.
(Applause) So these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab, and I managed to get them to try it out, and shoot a video.
They really loved it.
And, one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people many instructions.
All you have to say is, "Make words," and they know exactly what to do.
So here's another few people trying it out.
That's our youngest beta tester, down there on the right.
Turns out, all he wanted to do was to stack the Siftables up.
So to him, they were just blocks.
Now, this is an interactive cartoon application.
And we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners.
And this is Felix, actually.
And he can bring new characters into the scene, just by lifting the Siftables off the table that have that character shown on them.
Here, he's bringing the sun out.
Video: The sun is rising.
David Merrill: Now he's brought a tractor into the scene.
Video: The orange tractor.
Good job! Yeah!
DM: So by shaking the Siftables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact -- Video: Woof!
DM: inventing his own narrative.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's an open-ended story, and he gets to decide how it unfolds.
Video: Fly away, cat.
DM: So, the last example I have time to show you today is a music sequencing and live performance tool that we've built recently, in which Siftables act as sounds like lead, bass and drums.
Each of these has four different variations, you get to choose which one you want to use.
And you can inject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want.
And you inject it by just bumping up the sound Siftable against a sequence Siftable.
There are effects that you can control live, like reverb and filter.
You attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it.
And then, overall effects like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequence.
So let's have a look.
Video: (Music) DM: We'll start by putting a lead into two sequence Siftables, arrange them into a series, extend it, add a little more lead.
Now I put a bass line in.
Video: (Music) DM: Now I'll put some percussion in.
Video: (Music) DM: And now I'll attach the filter to the drums, so I can control the effect live.
Video: (Music) DM: I can speed up the whole sequence by tilting the tempo one way or the other.
Video: (Music) DM: And now I'll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression.
Video: (Music) DM: I can rearrange the sequence while it plays.
So I don't have to plan it out in advance, but I can improvise, making it longer or shorter as I go.
And now, finally, I can fade the whole sequence out using the volume Siftable, tilted to the left.
(Applause) Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is for making new human-computer interfaces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work.
And today, I had time to show you one point in this new design space, and a few of the possibilities that we're working to bring out of the laboratory.
So the thought I want to leave you with is that we're on the cusp of this new generation of tools for interacting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms.
Thank you very much.
I look forward to talking with all of you.
(Applause)
My name is Nanfu.
In Chinese, "nan" means "man."
And "fu" means "pillar."
My family had hoped for a boy, who would grow up to be the pillar of the family.
And when I turned out to be a girl, they named me Nanfu anyway.
(Laughter) I was born in 1985, six years before China announced its one-child policy.
Right after I was born, the local officials came and ordered my mom to be sterilized.
My grandpa stood up to the officials, because he wanted a grandson to carry on the family name.
Eventually, my parents were allowed to have a second child, but they had to wait for five years and pay a substantial fine.
Growing up, my brother and I were surrounded by children from one-child families.
I remember feeling a sense of shame because I had a younger brother.
I felt like our family did something wrong for having two children.
At the time, I didn't question where this sense of shame and guilt came from.
A year and a half ago, I had my own first child.
It was the best thing that ever happened in my life.
Becoming a mother gave me a totally new perspective on my own childhood, and it brought back my memories of early life in China.
For the past three decades, everyone in my family had to apply for a permission from the government to have a child.
And I wondered what it was like for people who lived under the one-child policy.
So I decided to make a documentary about it.
One of the people I interviewed was the midwife who delivered all of the babies born in my village, including myself.
She was 84 years old when I interviewed her.
I asked her, "Do you remember how many babies you delivered throughout your career?"
She didn't have a number for deliveries.
She said she had performed 60,000 forced abortions and sterilizations.
Sometimes, she said, a late-term fetus would survive an abortion, and she would kill the baby after delivering it.
She remembered how her hands would tremble as she did the work.
Her story shocked me.
When I set out to make the film, I expected it would be a simple story of perpetrators and victims.
People who carried out the policy and people who are living with the consequences.
But that wasn't what I saw.
As I was finishing my interview with the midwife, I noticed an area in her house that was decorated with elaborate homemade flags.
And each flag has a picture of a baby on it.
These were flags that were sent by families whom she helped treat their infertility problems.
She explained that she had had enough of performing abortions and sterilizations -- that the only work she did now was to help families have babies.
She said she was full of guilt for carrying out the one-child policy, and she hoped that by helping families have babies, she could counteract what she did in the past.
It became clear to me she, too, was a victim of the policy.
Every voice was telling her that what she did was right and necessary for China's survival.
And she did what she thought was right for her country.
I know how strong that message was.
It was everywhere around myself when I grew up.
It was printed on matches, playing cards, textbooks, posters.
The propaganda praising the one-child policy was everywhere around us.
[Anyone who refuses to sterilize will be arrested.] And so were the threats against disobeying it.
The message seeped into our minds so much so that I grew up feeling embarrassed for having a younger brother.
With each person I filmed, I saw how their minds and hearts can be influenced by the propaganda, and how their willingness to make sacrifices for the greater good can be twisted into something very dark and tragic.
China is not the only place where this happens.
There is no country on earth where propaganda isn't present.
And in societies that are supposed to be more open and free than China, it can be even harder to recognize what propaganda looks like.
It hides in plain sight as news reports, TV commercials, political campaigning and in our social media feeds.
It works to change our minds without our knowledge.
Every society is vulnerable to accepting propaganda as truth, and no society where propaganda replaces the truth can be truly free.
Thank you.
(Applause)
“Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions.
You change direction but the sandstorm chases you.
You turn again, but the storm adjusts.
Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just before dawn.
Why?
Because this storm isn't something that blew in from far away… This storm is you. Something inside of you.” This quote, from the first chapter of Haruki Murakami’s "Kafka on the Shore," captures the teenage protagonist's turmoil.
Desperate to escape his tyrannical father and the family curse he feels doomed to repeat, he renames himself Kafka after his favorite author and runs away from home.
But memories of a missing mother, along with dreams that haunt his waking life, prove more difficult to outrun.
Published in Japanese in 2002 and translated into English three years later, "Kafka on the Shore" is an epic literary puzzle filled with time travel, hidden histories, and magical underworlds.
Readers delight in discovering how the mind-bending imagery, whimsical characters and eerie coincidences fit together.
Kafka narrates every second chapter, with the rest centering on an old man named Satoru Nakata.
After awakening from a coma he went into during the Second World War, Nakata loses the ability to read and write– but gains a mysterious knack for talking to cats.
When he’s asked to tail a missing pet, he’s thrown onto a dangerous path that runs parallel to Kafka’s.
Soon prophecies come true, portals to different dimensions open up– and fish and leeches begin raining from the sky.
But what ties these two characters together– and is it a force either one of them can control?
The collision of different worlds is a common thread in Haruki Murakami’s work.
His novels and short stories often forge fantastic connections between personal experience, supernatural possibilities, and Japanese history.
Born in Kyoto in 1949, Murakami grew up during the post-World War II American occupation of Japan.
The shadow of war hung over his life as it does his fiction; "Kafka on the Shore" features biological attacks, military ghosts and shady conspiracies.
Murakami’s work blurs historical periods and draws from multiple cultural traditions.
References to Western society and Japanese customs tumble over each other, from literature and fashion to food and ghost stories.
He has a penchant for musical references, too, especially in "Kafka on the Shore."
As the runaway Kafka wanders the streets of a strange city, Led Zeppelin and Prince keep him company.
Soon, he takes refuge in an exquisite private library.
While he spends his days poring over old books and contemplating a strange painting and the library’s mysterious owner, he also befriends the librarian– who introduces him to classical music like Schubert.
This musical sensibility makes Murakami’s work all the more hypnotic.
He frequently bends the line between reality and a world of dreams, and is considered a master of magic lurking in the mundane.
This is a key feature of magical realism.
In contrast to fantasy, magic in this sort of writing rarely offers a way out of a problem.
Instead, it becomes just one more thing that complicates life.
In "Kafka on the Shore," characters are faced with endless otherworldly distractions, from a love sick ghost to a flute made from cat souls.
These challenges offer no easy answers.
Instead, they leave us marveling at the resourcefulness of the human spirit to deal with the unexpected.
While Kafka often seems suspended in strangeness, there’s a tenderness and integrity at the heart of his mission that keeps him moving forward.
Gradually he comes to accept his inner confusion.
In the end, his experience echoes the reader’s: the deeper you go, the more you find.
Last summer, I got a call from a woman named Ellie.
And she had heard about the family separations at the southern border and wanted to know what she could do to help.
She told me the story of her grandfather and his father.
When they were kids in Poland, their father, fearing for his son's safety, gave them a little bit of money and told them to walk west, to just keep walking west across Europe.
And they did.
They walked all the way west across Europe, and they got on a boat and they got to America.
Ellie said that when she heard the stories of the teens walking up across Mexico, all she could think about was her grandfather and his brother.
She said that for her, the stories were exactly the same.
Those brothers were the Hassenfeld Brothers -- the "Has" "bros" -- the Hasbro toy company, which, of course, brought us Mr. Potato Head.
But that is not actually why I'm telling you this story.
I'm telling you this story because it made me think about whether I would have the faith, the courage, to send my teens -- and I have three of them -- on a journey like that.
Knowing that they wouldn't be safe where we were, would I be able to watch them go?
I started my career decades ago at the southern US border, working with Central American asylum seekers.
And in the last 16 years, I've been at HIAS, the Jewish organization that fights for refugee rights around the world, as a lawyer and an advocate.
And one thing I've learned is that, sometimes, the things that we're told make us safer and stronger actually don't.
And, in fact, some of these policies have the opposite of the intended results and in the meantime, cause tremendous and unnecessary suffering.
So why are people showing up at our southern border?
Most of the immigrants and refugees that are coming to our southern border are fleeing three countries: Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.
These countries are consistently ranked among the most violent countries in the world.
It's very difficult to be safe in these countries, let alone build a future for yourself and your family.
And violence against women and girls is pervasive.
People have been fleeing Central America for generations.
Generations of refugees have been coming to our shores, fleeing the civil wars of the 1980s, in which the United States was deeply involved.
This is nothing new.
What's new is that recently, there's been a spike in families, children and families, showing up at checkpoints and presenting themselves to seek asylum.
Now, this has been in the news lately, so I want you to remember a few things as you see those images.
One, this is not a historically high level of interceptions at the southern border, and, in fact, people are presenting themselves at checkpoints.
Two, people are showing up with the clothes on their backs; some of them are literally in flip-flops.
And three, we're the most powerful country in the world.
It's not a time to panic.
It's easy from the safety of the destination country to think in terms of absolutes: Is it legal, or is it illegal?
But the people who are wrestling with these questions and making these decisions about their families are thinking about very different questions: How do I keep my daughter safe?
How do I protect my son?
And if you want absolutes, it's absolutely legal to seek asylum.
It is a fundamental right in our own laws and in international law.
And, in fact -- (Applause) it stems from the 1951 Refugee Convention, which was the world's response to the Holocaust and a way for countries to say never again would we return people to countries where they would harmed or killed.
There are several ways refugees come to this country.
One is through the US Refugee Admissions Program.
Through that program, the US identifies and selects refugees abroad and brings them to the United States.
Last year, the US resettled fewer refugees than at any time since the program began in 1980.
And this year, it'll probably be less.
And this is at a time when we have more refugees in the world than at any other time in recorded history, even since World War II.
Another way that refugees come to this country is by seeking asylum.
Asylum seekers are people who present themselves at a border and say that they'll be persecuted if they're sent back home.
An asylum seeker is simply somebody who's going through the process in the United States to prove that they meet the refugee definition.
And it's never been more difficult to seek asylum.
Border guards are telling people when they show up at our borders that our country's full, that they simply can't apply.
This is unprecedented and illegal.
Under a new program, with the kind of Orwellian title "Migrant Protection Protocols," refugees are told they have to wait in Mexico while their cases make their way through the courts in the United States, and this can take months or years.
Meanwhile, they're not safe, and they have no access to lawyers.
Our country, our government, has detained over 3,000 children, separating them from their parents' arms, as a deterrent from seeking asylum.
Many were toddlers, and at least one was a six-year-old blind girl.
And this is still going on.
We spend billions to detain people in what are virtually prisons who have committed no crime.
And family separation has become the hallmark of our immigration system.
That's a far cry from a shining city on a hill or a beacon of hope or all of the other ways we like to talk about ourselves and our values.
Migration has always been with us, and it always will be.
The reasons why people flee -- persecution, war, violence, climate change and the ability now to see on your phone what life is like in other places -- those pressures are only growing.
But there are ways that we can have policies that reflect our values and actually make sense, given the reality in the world.
The first thing we need to do is dial back the toxic rhetoric that has been the basis of our national debate on this issue for too long.
(Applause) I am not an immigrant or a refugee myself, but I take these attacks personally, because my grandparents were.
My great-grandmother Rose didn't see her kids for seven years, as she tried to bring them from Poland to New York.
She left my grandfather when he was seven and didn't see him again until he was 14.
On the other side of my family, my grandmother Aliza left Poland in the 1930s and left for what was then the British Mandate of Palestine, and she never saw her family and friends again.
Global cooperation as a response to global migration and displacement would go a long way towards making migration something that isn't a crisis but something that just is, and that we deal with as a global community.
Humanitarian aid is also critical.
The amount of support we provide to countries in Central America that are sending refugees and migrants is a tiny fraction of the amount we spend on enforcement and detention.
And we can absolutely have an asylum system that works.
For a tiny fraction of the cost of a wall, we could hire more judges, make sure asylum seekers have lawyers and commit to a humane asylum system.
(Applause) And we could resettle more refugees.
To give you a sense of the decline in the refugee program: three years ago, the US resettled 15,000 Syrian refugees in response to the largest refugee crisis on earth.
A year later, that number was 3,000.
And last year, that number was 62 people.
62 people.
Despite the harsh rhetoric and efforts to block immigration, keep refugees out of the country, support for refugees and immigrants in this country, according to polls, has never been higher.
Organizations like HIAS, where I work, and other humanitarian and faith-based organizations, make it easy for you to take a stand when there's a law that's worth opposing or a law that's worth supporting or a policy that needs oversight.
If you have a phone, you can do something, and if you want to do more, you can.
I will tell you that if you see one of these detention centers along the border with children in them -- they're jails -- you will never be the same.
What I loved so much about my call with Ellie was that she knew in her core that the stories of her grandparents were no different than today's stories, and she wanted to do something about it.
If I leave you with one thing, beyond the backstory for Mr. Potato Head, which is, of course, a good story to leave with, it's that a country shows strength through compassion and pragmatism, not through force and through fear.
(Applause) These stories of the Hassenfelds and my relatives and your relatives are still happening today; they're all the same.
A country is strong when it says to the refugee, not, "Go away," but, "It's OK, we've got you, you're safe."
Thank you.
(Applause) Thanks.
(Applause)
In 1969 in July, three Americans launched into space.
Now, they went to the surface of the moon, they famously made the great leap for mankind.
Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong, they walked on the surface, they planted this flag.
It's rightly celebrated as a moment that in America we say is a triumph.
We think it was this amazing accomplishment.
They didn't just leave behind this flag, though.
They also left behind a plaque.
This plaque is a beautiful object, and one that I want to talk to you a little bit about.
First, you might notice that there's two globes, representing all of earth.
And then there's this beautiful statement: "We came in peace for all mankind."
Now, at first, this is just nice poetic language, but it's also set in a typeface that's perfect for this moment.
It seems industrial, it seems engineered.
It also is the best possible name you could come up with for something on the moon: Futura.
Now, I want to talk to you about fonts, and why this typeface is perfect for this moment.
But it's actually more than just ceremonial.
Now, when all of you arrived here today, you actually had to think about fonts.
You might not realize it, but you're all unconscious experts on typography.
Typography is the study of how fonts inhabit our world, they're the visual language of the words we use.
Here's the thing that's funny about this, though.
I know you're probably not like me, you're not a font nerd, maybe some of you are, but if you're not, that's alright, because I might spend hours every day trying to pick the perfect typeface for the perfect project, or I might spend thousands of dollars every year, trying to get ones with the right features.
But all of you actually spend hours every day, evaluating fonts.
If you don't believe me, think about how you got here.
Each of you had to judge by the signs and maybe even on your phone, which signals to trust and which to ignore.
You were evaluating fonts.
Or maybe when you're just buying a new product, you have to think about whether something is expensive or cheap or hard to get or easy to find.
And the funny thing about it is, this may not seem extraordinary to you, but the moment you see something out of place, you recognize it right away.
(Laughter) The thing I love about typography, and why I love fonts and why I love Futura, is that, for me, what I study is everywhere.
Every street that I walk down, every book that I pick up, every thing that I read is filled with the thing I love.
Now, once you understand the history and what happens with typography, you actually have a history of everything before you.
And this is the typeface Futura.
As previously we've discussed, this is modernism in miniature.
This is a way in which modernism infiltrated this country and became perhaps the most popular, or promiscuous typeface, of the twentieth century.
"Less is more," right, these are the aphorisms of modernism.
And in the visual arts, the same thing happened.
Let's focus on the essentials, focus on the basic shapes, focus on geometry.
So Futura actually holds this to its core.
You might notice that the shapes inherent in Futura have circles, squares, triangles.
Some of the shapes are all based on circles, like the O, D and C, or others have this pointed apex of the triangle.
Others just look like they might have been made with a ruler or a compass.
They feel geometric, they feel mathematic, precise.
In fact, this whole system carries through with the way that the typeface was designed.
To not look like it was made like other typefaces, to be something new.
Here it is in the lightweight, the medium weight and the bold weight.
The whole family has different things to commend to it.
This was a conscious break from the past, something that looked like it was made by a machine, and not by hand.
When I say not made by hand, this is what I mean.
This is what we think about maybe, when you might create something with a calligraphic brush or a pen.
That there's thicks and thins.
And even more traditional typefaces, say like a Garamond, holds vestiges of this old system in which you can see the A where it get little bit thinner at the top and thicker down below, because it's trying to look like someone had made it by hand.
But Futura, in contrast, is designed to look like no one had touched it at all, that this was made by a machine, for a machine age, for an industrial age.
There's actually a sleight of hand here that Paul Renner, the designer who made this in 1927, employed.
If you look at the way in which the circular shape joins with the vertical shaft, you'll notice that it tapers just every so slightly.
And this is one of hundreds of ways in which this typeface was designed to look geometrically perfect, even though it's mathematically not.
And this is what typeface designers do all the time to make typefaces work, every day.
Now, there were other designers doing this at the same time in Europe and America.
These are a few other excellent examples from Europe, trying to create something new for the new age, a new moment in time.
These are some other ones in Germany that in some ways look very similar to Futura, maybe with higher waist or lower waist or different proportions.
Then why did Futura take over the world?
In this case, if you can read the titles there, some of these names don't quite roll off the tongue: Erbar, Kabel Light, Berthold-Grotesk, Elegant-Grotesk.
These aren't exactly household names, are they?
And so when you compare that to Futura, you realize that this was a really good choice by the marketing team.
What's amazing about this name -- you know, what's in this name is that this is a name that actually invokes hope and an idea about the future.
And this isn't actually the word for future in German, it wasn't a German name, they actually picked something that would speak to a wider, larger audience, a universal audience.
And when you compare it to what was being done in America -- these are the typefaces from the same period in the United States in the 1920s, bold, brash, braggadocios.
You almost think of this as exactly like what the stock market looked like when they were all going nuts in the 1920s.
And you realize that Futura is doing something revolutionary.
I want to step back and talk about an example of the typeface in use.
So this is a magazine that we all probably know today, "Vanity Fair."
This is what it looked like in 1929, in the summer.
And in many ways, there's nothing wrong with this design.
This is absolutely typical of the 1920s.
There's a photograph of an important person, in this case Franklin Roosevelt, then-governor of New York.
Everything seems centered, everything seems symmetrical.
There's still a little bit of ornamentation, so this is still maybe having some vestiges of the painted lady and not fully modernistic.
But everything seems kid of solid.
There's even drop caps to help you get into the text.
But this all changed very quickly and in October of 1929, a Berlin-based designer came and redesigned "Vanity Fair."
And this is what it looks like with Futura.
Instead of the governor now we have a photograph of an abstract, beautiful setting, in this case, the ocean.
Instead of drop caps, there's nothing at all.
And replaced with a centered layout is now asymmetry.
And it gets even more radical the further you enter the magazine.
In this case, even more dramatic asymmetry.
In this case, illustrations by Pablo Picasso, moving across the page and breaking the gutter of the two pages.
And there's something even more radical.
If you look closely at the Futura, you might notice something.
You might not pick it up at first, but there are no capital letters in the title or the captions on this page.
You might not think that's very radical, but pick up any magazine, any book or go to any website, and I guarantee, you are not going to find it very easily.
This is still a radical idea.
And why is that radical?
When we think about what capital letters denote, they denote something important, whether it's our names, or our titles.
Or maybe even just the name of our corporations, or maybe our trademarks.
Actually, in some ways, America's the home of capitalization.
We love putting capitals in everything.
(Laughter) But think about how radical this would be to introduce a magazine where you're taking away all the capital letters.
This has maybe had the same political force that we now argue over things like pronouns in our society today.
In the 1920s, this is just shortly after Soviet Russia had a communist revolution.
And for them, this actually represented a socialist infiltration into America.
All lowercase letters meant that this was an egalitarian, complete lowering of everything into one equal playing field.
Now this is still kind of a radical idea.
Think about how often you do capitalize something to have more power or prestige to it.
So for them to do this was a way in which Futura was using this idea.
Now, other designers were doing other things with Futura.
Others brought other ideas of modernism with it, whether it was interesting new illustration styles, or interesting new collage types of illustration.
Or even just new book covers, whether they were from Europe.
But here's the funny thing.
In the 1920s, if you wanted to use a new typeface, you couldn't just go download it onto your computer.
You actually had to have pieces of lead.
So for Americans who wanted to adopt this and make it part of their own system, something they could use in everyday typography, whether in ads or anything else, they actually had to have metal type.
So being good American capitalists, what did we do?
We made all sorts of copies.
Ones that had nothing to do with the name Futura, but looked identical to it, whether it was Spartan or Tempo.
And in fact, by the time that World War II started, American corporations were actually trying to boycott Nazi goods.
But they said, "Go ahead and use our copies.
Use 20th Century, use Spartan, use Vogue, use Tempo.
These are identical to Futura."
And in fact, for most people, they didn't even learn the new names, they just still called it all Futura.
So America took this typeface in, conquered it and made it its own.
So by the time World War II finishes, Americans are using this on everything, whether it be catalogs, or atlases, or encyclopedias or charts and graphs, or calendars, or even political material.
And even the logo for a new expansion football team.
And in fact, it was used even on some of the most important advertising of the 20th century.
So it's in this context that when the US government was picking a typeface to use after World War II for new maps and new projects, they picked Futura.
It wasn't an astounding choice, it wasn't a radical choice, it didn't have anything to do with communism.
But in this case, it was used on some of the most important maps, so this one, an air force map in 1962, or used for the maps in Vietnam in '66.
And so it wasn't a surprise that when astronauts first started the Mercury program, such as John Glenn orbiting the earth, that charts and maps that he was using were in Futura.
And in fact, by the time Mercury morphed into Apollo, it started getting used more and more for more things.
So in this case for a safety plan, or even starting to get used on instrument panels, or navigational aids.
Or even on diagrams to show how the whole system worked.
But here's the amazing thing, it didn't just get used for papers that they handed out to people.
It started to get used for an interface, for an entire system that helped the astronauts know how to use the machine.
NASA wasn't just one big corporation making everything.
There was hundreds of contractors -- Boeing, IBM, McDonnell Douglas -- all making different machines.
Now imagine if astronauts had to use different typefaces and different systems for each component they had in the space shuttles.
This would have been impossible to navigate and there would have been a cognitive overload every time they had to open up a new system.
So in this case, Futura being used on the interface helped them navigate complexity and make it more clear.
And it wasn't just used on buttons, it was used on labels, and it was used on their food rations, and it was used on their tool kits.
It was used on knobs and levers to tell them what to do.
In fact, maybe even some of the places where they needed to have things that were complex be more simple to them, instructions were printed entirely in Futura, so that they could know what to do with that one moment.
They didn't have to remember everything in their head, they could have it out there in the world to see and refer to.
In this case, Futura helped make that system, which was already a very difficult and complex system, a little less complex.
In fact, the very first or last thing an astronaut might have seen when they were entering or exiting the spacecraft would have been in Futura.
One of my favorite examples of how Futura worked in this way is actually this camera.
This is a Hasselblad that was made by the Swedish company.
It's a perfectly good camera, some of you might have used one, it's prized by photographers as a really great camera.
And you might notice, if you know anything about cameras, that there's some modifications made to it.
In this case, there are stickers placed all over the film canisters, or other parts of the camera here.
What this enabled NASA to do, was make something really great out of the astronauts.
They're not photographers, they're not experts in art.
But they could ensure that they would know how to use this camera because of the labels placed there in Futura.
So in this case, Futura acquired and made sure that they had legitimacy with the things they were using.
In this case to not take off the film before it would expose.
Which, in this case, we would have never had some of the amazing photos we had without this label.
When we see something as decorative as this, a ceremonial patch, or something like this plaque on the moon, we realize that Futura was more than just something ceremonial, something more than something that had just been picked for its design.
In fact, Futura had authority, had legitimacy and had power because of this choice.
There's one other thing I want to talk about in closing.
And that is that Futura tells a story.
And this is what I love about typefaces, is that all of them tell stories.
And in this case, this typeface tells a very powerful story about assimilation, about something being taken into America and being made part of its culture.
And that's one of the best and worst things America does, is we take things into our culture and we spit them out back again and claim them our own.
And in this case, Futura mirrors exactly what happened with the technology undergirding the whole system.
Futura was a German typeface, taken in, made into an American commodity.
And so were the technologies: the rockets, the scientists all came from Germany as well.
So in some ways, this German typeface on an American plaque perfectly mirrors what happened with the technology.
And in this case, when you think about this story, you realize that typography on the moon represents legitimacy, represents authority, and this gave them, the astronauts, the power to get to the moon.
Thank you.
(Applause)
My name is Amy Padnani, and I'm an editor on the obituaries desk at the "New York Times."
Or, as some friends call me, the angel of death.
(Laughter) In fact, people will ask me, "Isn't it depressing, working on obituaries and thinking about death all the time?"
But you know what I tell them?
Obits aren't about death, they're about life, they're interesting, they're relatable.
Often about something you never knew.
Recently, for example, we had the obit for the inventor of the sock puppet.
(Laughter) Everyone knows what a sock puppet is, but have you ever thought about who created it, or what their life was like?
Obits are a signature form of journalism.
An art form, if you will.
It's an opportunity for a writer to weave the tale of a person's life into a beautiful narrative.
Since 1851, the "New York Times" has published thousands of obituaries.
For heads of state, famous celebrities, even the person who came up with the name on the Slinky.
There's just one problem.
Only a small percentage of them chronicle the lives of women and people of color.
That's the impetus behind a project I created called "Overlooked," which tells the stories of marginalized groups of people who never got an obit.
It's a chance for the newspaper to revisit its 168-year existence and fill in the gaps for people who were, for whatever reason, left out.
It's a chance to right the wrongs of the past, and to refocus society's lens on who is considered important.
I came up with the idea when I first joined Obituaries in 2017.
The Black Lives Matter movement was at a rolling boil, and the conversation on gender inequality had just started bubbling up again.
And at the same time, I wondered, as a journalist and as a woman of color, what could I do to help advance this conversation.
People were coming out of the shadows to tell stories of injustices that they had faced, and I could feel their pain.
So I noticed we would get these emails, sometimes, from readers, saying, "Hey, why don't you have more women and people of color in your obituaries?"
And I thought, "Yeah, why don't we?"
Since I was new to the team, I asked my colleagues, and they said, "Well, the people who are dying today are from a generation when women and people of color weren't invited to the table to make a difference.
Perhaps in a generation or two, we'll start to see more women and people of color in our obituaries."
That answer just wasn't satisfying at all.
(Laughter) I wanted to know: Where are all the dead women?
(Laughter) So I started thinking about how we hear about people who have died, right?
Number one way is through reader submissions.
And so I thought, "Well, what if we were to look at international newspapers or scour social media?"
It was around this time when ...
Everything was swirling in my mind, and I came across a website about Mary Outerbridge.
She was credited with introducing tennis to America in 1874.
And I thought, wow, one of the biggest sports in America was introduced by a woman?
Does anyone even know that?
And did she get a New York Times obituary?
Spoiler alert -- she did not.
(Laughter) So then I wondered who else we missed.
And it sent me on this deep dive through the archives.
There were some surprises.
The pioneering journalist Ida B. Wells, who started the campaign against lynching.
The brilliant poet Sylvia Plath.
Ada Lovelace, a mathematician now recognized as the first computer programmer.
So I went back to my team and I said, "What if we were to tell their stories now?"
It took a while to get buy-in.
There was this concern that, you know, the newspaper might look bad because it didn't get it right the first time.
It was also a little weird to sort of look back at the past, rather than cover news stories of our day.
But I said, "Guys, I really think this is worthwhile."
And once my team saw the value in it, they were all in.
And so, with the help of a dozen writers and editors, we launched on March 8, 2018, with the stories of 15 remarkable women.
And while I knew that the work my team was doing was powerful, I didn't expect the response to be equally powerful.
I had hundreds of emails.
They were from people who said, "Thank you for finally giving these women a voice."
They were from readers who said, "I cried on my way to work, reading these stories, because I felt seen for the first time."
And they were from colleagues of mine, who said, "I never thought a woman of color would be allowed to achieve something like this at the 'New York Times.'" I also got about 4,000 reader submissions suggesting who else we might have overlooked.
And some of those are my favorite stories in the project.
My all-time favorite is Grandma Gatewood.
(Laughter) She survived 30 years of domestic violence at the hands of her husband.
One day, he beat her so badly, beyond recognition, he even broke a broomstick over her head, and she threw flour in his face in response.
But when the police arrived, they arrested her, not him.
The mayor saw her in jail and took her into his own home until she could get back on her feet.
Then, one day, she read this article in "National Geographic" about how no woman had ever hiked the Appalachian Trail in its entirety alone.
And she said, "You know what? I'm going to do it."
Reporters caught wind of the old grandma who is hiking through the woods.
And at the finish, they asked her, "How did you survive so rough a place?"
But they had no idea what she had survived before that.
So, "Overlooked" has become wildly successful.
It's becoming a TV show now, on Netflix.
(Laughter) (Applause) I cannot wait to see this thing come to life.
Something like 25 different publishers have reached out to me with interest in turning "Overlooked" into a book.
All of this clearly shows how timely and necessary this project is.
It's also a reminder of how newspapers document what's happening in our world every single day, and we have to make sure not to leave out key people.
That's why, even though it's been so meaningful to look back in the past, I'm plagued with the lingering question: "What about the future of obituaries -- how do I diversify those?"
That was my original problem, right?
So to start answering this question, I wanted to gather some information.
I went down to the sub-sub-basement level of the New York Times Building, to the archives.
We call it the morgue.
(Laughter) And I asked for some guidance from our archivist there.
He pointed me to a book called "New York Times Obituaries Index."
So we handed it to the New York Genealogical Society, and they digitized it for us.
And then a programmer wrote up a program that scanned all those headlines for "Mr.," Mrs.," "Lady," "Sir," all the sort of gender-defining terms.
And what we found was that from 1851 to 2017, only about 15 to 20 percent of our obits were on women.
So next, I worked with a programmer to build this tool, called the diversity analysis tool.
It's a very dry name, but bear with me, it's super helpful.
It breaks down the percentage of our obits month to month, women to men.
OK, if that doesn't sound like much to you, this is how I used to calculate it before.
(Laughter) So I asked this programmer to program in a goal, and that goal was 30 percent.
From the year of "Overlooked's" launch, March of 2018, to March of 2019, I was hoping we could get to 30 percent of our obits on women.
It was a number we hadn't achieved in a 168 years, and I'm happy to say we did it -- we got to 31 percent.
(Applause) It's awesome, but it's not enough.
Next we're hoping to get to 35 percent, and then 40 percent, until we achieve parity.
And then I'm hoping to partner with this programmer again, to build a similar tool to measure people of color in our obits.
That was something I wanted to do with "Overlooked" too, to include men of color, and I finally got to do it with a special section for Black History Month, where we told the stories of about a dozen black men and women.
Again, it was a really powerful experience.
Many of these people had been slaves or were a generation removed from slavery.
A lot of them had to make up stories about their past just to get ahead in life.
And there were these patterns of their struggles that came up again and again.
Elizabeth Jennings, for instance, had to fight for her right to ride on segregated street cars in New York City -- a hundred years before Rosa Parks did the exact same thing with buses.
It was just a reminder of how far we've come, and how much more we still have left to do.
"Overlooked" is including other marginalized people as well.
Recently, we had the obit for the computer programmer Alan Turing.
Believe it or not, this brilliant man never got an obituary, even though his work decoding German messages during World War II helps end the war.
Instead, he died a criminal for his sexual orientation, and he was forced to endure chemical castration.
Great things, like this obits project, do not come easily.
There were a lot of fits and starts as I worked hard to convince people it was worth getting it off the ground.
There were moments when I faced great self-doubt.
I wondered if I was crazy or if I was all alone, and if I should just give up.
When I've seen the reaction to this project, I know I'm not at all alone.
There's so many people who feel the way I do.
And so yeah, not many people think about obituaries.
But when you do, you realize they're a testament to a human life.
They're the last chance to talk about somebody's contribution on the world.
They were also an example of who society deemed important.
A hundred years from now, somebody could be looking into the past to see what our time was like.
I'm lucky, as a journalist, to have been able to have used this form of storytelling to help shift a narrative.
I was also able to get an established institution to question its own status quo.
Little by little, I'm hoping I can keep doing this work, and continue refocusing society's lens so that nobody else gets overlooked.
Thank you.
(Applause)
First of all, thank you for your attention.
There's nothing quite like being in a room full of people like this, where all of you are giving your attention to me.
It's a powerful feeling, to get attention.
I'm an actor, so I'm a bit of an expert on, well, nothing, really.
(Laughter) But I do know what it feels like to get attention -- I've been lucky in my life to get a lot more than my fair share of attention.
And I'm grateful for that, because like I said, it's a powerful feeling.
But there's another powerful feeling that I've also been lucky to experience a lot as an actor.
And it's funny, it's sort of the opposite feeling, because it doesn't come from getting attention.
It comes from paying attention.
When I'm acting, I get so focused that I'm only paying attention to one thing.
Like when I'm on set and we're about to shoot and the first AD calls out "Rolling!"
And then I hear "speed," "marker," "set," and then the director calls "Action!"
I've heard that sequence so many times, like, it's become this Pavlovian magic spell for me.
"Rolling," "speed," "marker," "set" and "action."
Something happens to me, I can't even help it.
My attention ...
narrows.
And everything else in the world, anything else that might be bothering me or might grab my attention, it all goes away, and I'm just ... there.
And that feeling, that is what I love, that, to me, is creativity.
And that's the biggest reason I'm so grateful that I get to be an actor.
So, there's these two powerful feelings.
There's getting attention and paying attention.
Of course, in the last decade or so, new technology has allowed more and more people to have this powerful feeling of getting attention.
For any kind of creative expression, not just acting.
It could be writing or photography or drawing, music -- everything.
The channels of distribution have been democratized, and that's a good thing.
But I do think there's an unintended consequence for anybody on the planet with an urge to be creative -- myself included, because I'm not immune to this.
I think that our creativity is becoming more and more of a means to an end -- and that end is to get attention.
And so I feel compelled to speak up because in my experience, the more I go after that powerful feeling of paying attention, the happier I am.
But the more I go after the powerful feeling of getting attention, the unhappier I am.
(One person claps) And -- thanks.
(Laughter) (Applause) So this is something that goes way back for me.
I think the first time I can remember using my acting to get attention, I was eight years old at summer camp.
And I'd been going on auditions for about a year by then, and I'd been lucky to get some small parts in TV shows and commercials, and I bragged about it a lot, that summer at camp.
And at first, it worked.
The other kids gave me a bunch of extra attention, because I had been on "Family Ties."
That's a picture of me on "Family Ties."
(Laughter) Then, the tide turned -- I think I took it too far with the bragging.
And then, the other kids started to make fun of me.
I remember there was this one girl I had a crush on, Rocky.
Her name was Rachel, she went by Rocky.
And she was beautiful, and she could sing, and I was smitten with her, and I was standing there, bragging.
And she turned to me and she called me a show-off.
Which I 100 percent deserved.
But you know, it still really hurt.
And ever since that summer, I've had a certain hesitance to seek attention for my acting.
Sometimes, people would ask me, "Wait a minute, if you don't like the attention, then why are you an actor?"
And I'd be like, "Because that's not what acting's about, man, it's about the art."
And they'd be like, "OK, OK, dude."
(Laughter) And then Twitter came out.
And I got totally hooked on it, just like everybody else, which made me into a complete hypocrite.
Because at that point, I was absolutely using my acting to get attention.
I mean, what, did I think I was just getting all these followers because of my brilliant tweets?
I actually did think that -- I was like -- (Laughter) "They don't just like me because they saw me in 'Batman,' they like what I have to say, I've got a way with words."
(Laughter) And then in no time at all, it started having an impact on my dearly beloved creative process.
It still does.
I try not to let it.
But you know, I'd be sitting there, like, reading a script.
And instead of thinking, "How can I personally identify with this character?"
Or "How is the audience going to relate to this story?"
I'm like, "What are people going to say about this movie on Twitter?"
And "What will I say back that will be good and snarky enough to get a lot of retweets, but not too harsh, because people love to get offended, and I don't want to get canceled?"
These are the thoughts that enter my mind when I'm supposed to be reading a script, trying to be an artist.
And I'm not here to tell you that technology is the enemy of creativity.
I don't think that.
I think tech is just a tool.
It has the potential to foster unprecedented human creativity.
Like, I even started an online community called HITRECORD, where people all over the world collaborate on all kinds of creative projects, so I don't think that social media or smartphones or any technology is problematic in and of itself.
But ...
if we're going to talk about the perils of creativity becoming a means to get attention, then we have to talk about the attention-driven business model of today's big social media companies, right?
(Applause) This will be familiar territory for some of you, but it's a really relevant question here: How does a social media platform like, for example, Instagram, make money?
It's not selling a photo-sharing service -- that part's free.
So what is it selling?
It's selling attention.
It's selling the attention of its users to advertisers.
And there's a lot of discussion right now about how much attention we're all giving to things like Instagram, but my question is: How is Instagram getting so much attention?
We get it for them.
Anytime somebody posts on Instagram, they get a certain amount of attention from their followers, whether they have a few followers or a few million followers.
And the more attention you're able to get, the more attention Instagram is able to sell.
So it's in Instagram's interest for you to get as much attention as possible.
And so it trains you to want that attention, to crave it, to feel stressed out when you're not getting enough of it.
Instagram gets its users addicted to the powerful feeling of getting attention.
And I know we all joke, like, "Oh my God, I'm so addicted to my phone," but this is a real addiction.
There's a whole science to it.
If you're curious, I recommend the work of Jaron Lanier, Tristan Harris, Nir Eyal.
But here's what I can tell you.
Being addicted to getting attention is just like being addicted to anything else.
It's never enough.
You start out and you're thinking, "If only I had 1,000 followers, that would feel amazing."
But then you're like, "Well, once I get to 10,000 followers," and, "Once I get to 100 -- Once I get to a million followers, then I'll feel amazing."
So I have 4.2 million followers on Twitter -- it's never made me feel amazing.
I'm not going to tell you how many I have on Instagram, because I feel genuine shame about how low the number is, because I joined Instagram after "Batman" came out.
(Laughter) And I search other actors, and I see that their number is higher than mine, and it makes me feel terrible about myself.
Because the follower count makes everybody feel terrible about themselves.
That feeling of inadequacy is what drives you to post, so you can get more attention, and then that attention that you get is what these companies sell, that's how they make their money.
So there is no amount of attention you can get where you feel like you've arrived, and you're like, "Ah, I'm good now."
And of course, there are a lot of actors who are more famous than I am, have more followers than I do, but I bet you they would tell you the same thing.
If your creativity is driven by a desire to get attention, you're never going to be creatively fulfilled.
But I do have some good news.
There is this other powerful feeling.
Something else you can do with your attention besides letting a giant tech company control it and sell it.
This is that feeling I was talking about, why I love acting so much -- it's being able to pay attention to just one thing.
Turns out there's actually some science behind this too.
Psychologists and neuroscientists -- they study a phenomenon they call flow, which is this thing that happens in the human brain when someone pays attention to just one thing, like something creative, and manages not to get distracted by anything else.
And some say the more regularly you do this, the happier you'll be.
Now I'm not a psychologist or a neuroscientist.
But I can tell you, for me, that is very true.
It's not always easy, it's hard.
To really pay attention like this takes practice, everybody does it their own way.
But if there's one thing I can share that I think helps me focus and really pay attention, it's this: I try not to see other creative people as my competitors.
I try to find collaborators.
Like, if I'm acting in a scene, if I start seeing the other actors as my competitors, and I'm like, "God, they're going to get more attention than I am, people are going to be talking about their performance more than mine" -- I've lost my focus.
And I'm probably going to suck in that scene.
But when I see the other actors as collaborators, then it becomes almost easy to focus, because I'm just paying attention to them.
And I don't have to think about what I'm doing -- I react to what they're doing, they react to what I'm doing, and we can kind of keep each other in it together.
But I don't want you to think it's only actors on a set that can collaborate in this way.
I could be in whatever kind of creative situation.
It could be professional, could be just for fun.
I could be collaborating with people I'm not even in the same room with.
In fact, some of my favorite things I've ever made, I made with people that I never physically met.
And by the way, this, to me, is the beauty of the internet.
If we could just stop competing for attention, then the internet becomes a great place to find collaborators.
And once I'm collaborating with other people, whether they're on set, or online, wherever, that makes it so much easier for me to find that flow, because we're all just paying attention to the one thing that we're making together.
And I fell like I'm part of something larger than myself, and we all sort of shield each other from anything else that might otherwise grab our attention, and we can all just be there.
At least that's what works for me.
Sometimes.
Sometimes -- it doesn't always work.
Sometimes, I still totally get wrapped up in that addictive cycle of wanting to get attention.
I mean, like, even right now, can I honestly say there's not some part of me here who's like, "Hey, everybody, look at me, I'm giving a TED Talk!"
(Laughter) There is -- there's, you know, some part.
But I can also honestly say that this whole creative process of writing and giving this talk, it's been a huge opportunity for me to focus and really pay attention to something I care a lot about.
So regardless of how much attention I do or don't get as a result, I'm happy I did it.
And I'm grateful to all of you for letting me.
So thank you, that's it, you can give your attention to someone else now.
Thanks again.
(Applause)
(Music) (Music ends) (Applause) Thank you!
(Applause continues) Thank you very much.
Like the speaker before me -- I am a TED virgin, I guess.
I'm also the first time here, and ...
(Applause) I'm really happy that Mr. Anderson invited me.
I'm really grateful that I get a chance to play for everyone.
And the song that I just played was by Josef Hofmann.
It's called "Kaleidoscope."
And Hofmann is a Polish pianist and composer of the late 19th century, and he's widely considered one of the greatest pianists of all time.
I have another piece that I'd like to play for you.
It's called "Abegg Variations," by Robert Schumann, a German 19th-century composer.
The name "Abegg" is actually A-B-E-G-G, and that's the main theme in the melody.
(Plays the notes A, B, E, G and G) That comes from the last name of one of Schumann's female friends.
(Laughter) But he wrote that for his wife.
(Laughter) So actually, if you listen carefully, there are supposed to be five variations on this Abegg theme.
It's written around 1834, so even though it's old, I hope you'll like it.
(Music) (Music ends) (Applause) Now comes the part that I hate.
Well, because Mr. Anderson told me that this session is called "Sync and Flow," I was wondering, "What do I know that these geniuses don't?"
(Laughter) So, I'll talk about musical composition, even though I don't know where to start.
How do I compose?
I think Yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to compose.
What I do first is, I make a lot of little musical ideas you can just improvise here at the piano -- and I choose one of those to become my main theme, my main melody, like the Abegg that you just heard.
And once I choose my main theme, I have to decide: Out of all the styles in music, what kind of style do I want?
And this year, I composed a Romantic style.
So for inspiration, I listened to Liszt and Tchaikovsky and all the great Romantic composers.
Next, I make the structure of the entire piece with my teachers.
They help me plan out the whole piece.
And then the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas, because then you have to think.
(Laughter) And then, when the piece takes somewhat of a solified form -- solidified, excuse me -- solidified form, you're supposed to actually polish the piece, polish the details, and then polish the overall performance of the composition.
And another thing that I enjoy doing is drawing.
Drawing, because I like to draw, you know, Japanese anime art.
I think that's a craze among teens right now.
And once I realized it, there's a parallel between creating music and creating art, because for your motive, or your little initial idea for your drawing, it's your character -- you want to decide who you want to draw, or if you want to draw an original character.
And then you want to decide: How are you going to draw the character?
Like, am I going to use one page? Am I going to draw it on the computer?
Am I going to use a two-page spread like a comic book?
For a more grandiose effect, I guess.
And then you have to do the initial sketch of the character, which is like your structure of a piece, and then you add pen and pencil, and whatever details that you need -- that's polishing the drawing.
And another thing that both of these have in common is your state of mind, because I know I'm one of those teenagers that are really easily distracted.
So if I'm trying to do homework and I don't feel like it, I'll try to draw or, you know, waste my time.
And then what happens is, sometimes I absolutely can't draw or I can't compose at all, and then it's like there's too much on your mind.
You can't focus on what you're supposed to do.
And sometimes, if you manage to use your time wisely and work on it, you'll get something out of it, but it doesn't come naturally.
What happens is, if something magical happens, if something natural happens to you, you're able to produce all this beautiful stuff instantly, and then that's what I consider "flow," because that's when everything clicks and you're able to do anything.
You feel like you're on top of your game and you can do anything you want.
I'm not going to play my own composition today because, although I did finish it, it's way too long.
Instead, I'd like to try something called "improvisation."
I have here seven note cards, one with each note of the musical alphabet.
And I'd like someone to come up here and choose five -- anyone to come up here and choose five -- and then I can make it into some sort of melody, and I'll improvise it.
Wow. A volunteer, yay!
(Laughter) (Applause) Jennifer Lin: Nice to meet you.
JL: Yes, five cards. Any five cards.
GH: OK, one. JL: OK.
GH: Oh, D and F -- too familiar.
(Laughter) JL: One more. GH: OK. "E" for "effort."
JL: Would you mind reading them out in the order that you chose them?
GH: OK -- C, G, B, A and E.
JL: Thank you very much!
GH: You're welcome. And what about these?
JL: I won't use them. Thank you!
(Applause) Now, she chose C, G, B, A, E.
I'm going to try to put that in some sort of order.
(Plays notes) OK, that's nice.
So, I'm going to have a moment to think, and I'll try to make something out of it.
(Plays the five notes) (Music) (Music ends) (Applause) The next song, or the encore that I'm going to play is called "Bumble Boogie," by Jack Fina.
(Applause) (Music) (Music ends) (Applause)
In his inaugural address, Barack Obama appealed to each of us to give our best as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis.
But what did he appeal to?
He did not, happily, follow in the footsteps of his predecessor, and tell us to just go shopping.
Nor did he tell us, "Trust us. Trust your country.
Invest, invest, invest."
Instead, what he told us was to put aside childish things.
And he appealed to virtue.
Virtue is an old-fashioned word.
It seems a little out of place in a cutting-edge environment like this one.
And besides, some of you might be wondering, what the hell does it mean?
Let me begin with an example.
This is the job description of a hospital janitor that is scrolling up on the screen.
And all of the items on it are unremarkable.
They're the things you would expect: mop the floors, sweep them, empty the trash, restock the cabinets.
It may be a little surprising how many things there are, but it's not surprising what they are.
But the one thing I want you to notice about them is this: even though this is a very long list, there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings.
Not one.
The janitor's job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital.
And yet, when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like, they encountered Mike, who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor because Mr. Jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise, trying to build up his strength, walking slowly up and down the hall.
And Charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisor's admonition and didn't vacuum the visitor's lounge because there were some family members who were there all day, every day who, at this moment, happened to be taking a nap.
And then there was Luke, who washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice because the man's father, who had been keeping a vigil for six months, didn't see Luke do it the first time, and his father was angry.
And behavior like this from janitors, from technicians, from nurses and, if we're lucky now and then, from doctors, doesn't just make people feel a little better, it actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well.
Now, not all janitors are like this, of course.
But the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions involving kindness, care and empathy are an essential part of the job.
And yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings.
These janitors have the moral will to do right by other people.
And beyond this, they have the moral skill to figure out what "doing right" means.
"Practical wisdom," Aristotle told us, "is the combination of moral will and moral skill."
A wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule, as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives.
A wise person knows how to improvise, as Luke did when he re-washed the floor.
Real-world problems are often ambiguous and ill-defined and the context is always changing.
A wise person is like a jazz musician -- using the notes on the page, but dancing around them, inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand.
A wise person knows how to use these moral skills in the service of the right aims.
To serve other people, not to manipulate other people.
And finally, perhaps most important, a wise person is made, not born.
Wisdom depends on experience, and not just any experience.
You need the time to get to know the people that you're serving.
You need permission to be allowed to improvise, try new things, occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures.
And you need to be mentored by wise teachers.
When you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones I described how hard it is to learn to do their job, they tell you that it takes lots of experience.
And they don't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans.
It takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people.
At TED, brilliance is rampant.
It's scary.
The good news is you don't need to be brilliant to be wise.
The bad news is that without wisdom, brilliance isn't enough.
It's as likely to get you and other people into trouble as anything else.
(Applause) Now, I hope that we all know this.
There's a sense in which it's obvious, and yet, let me tell you a little story.
It's a story about lemonade.
A dad and his seven-year-old son were watching a Detroit Tigers game at the ballpark.
His son asked him for some lemonade and Dad went to the concession stand to buy it.
All they had was Mike's Hard Lemonade, which was five percent alcohol.
Dad, being an academic, had no idea that Mike's Hard Lemonade contained alcohol.
So he brought it back.
And the kid was drinking it, and a security guard spotted it, and called the police, who called an ambulance that rushed to the ballpark, whisked the kid to the hospital.
The emergency room ascertained that the kid had no alcohol in his blood.
And they were ready to let the kid go.
But not so fast.
The Wayne County Child Welfare Protection Agency said no.
And the child was sent to a foster home for three days.
At that point, can the child go home?
Well, a judge said yes, but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel.
After two weeks, I'm happy to report, the family was reunited.
But the welfare workers and the ambulance people and the judge all said the same thing: "We hate to do it but we have to follow procedure."
How do things like this happen?
Scott Simon, who told this story on NPR, said, "Rules and procedures may be dumb, but they spare you from thinking."
And, to be fair, rules are often imposed because previous officials have been lax and they let a child go back to an abusive household.
Fair enough.
When things go wrong, as of course they do, we reach for two tools to try to fix them.
One tool we reach for is rules.
Better ones, more of them.
The second tool we reach for is incentives.
Better ones, more of them.
What else, after all, is there?
We can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis.
Regulate, regulate, regulate.
Fix the incentives, fix the incentives, fix the incentives ...
The truth is that neither rules nor incentives are enough to do the job.
How could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did?
And would you pay them a bonus for being empathic?
It's preposterous on its face.
And what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules, rules and incentives may make things better in the short run, but they create a downward spiral that makes them worse in the long run.
Moral skill is chipped away by an over-reliance on rules that deprives us of the opportunity to improvise and learn from our improvisations.
And moral will is undermined by an incessant appeal to incentives that destroy our desire to do the right thing.
And without intending it, by appealing to rules and incentives, we are engaging in a war on wisdom.
Let me just give you a few examples, first of rules and the war on moral skill.
The lemonade story is one.
Second, no doubt more familiar to you, is the nature of modern American education: scripted, lock-step curricula.
Here's an example from Chicago kindergarten.
Reading and enjoying literature and words that begin with 'B.' "The Bath:" Assemble students on a rug and give students a warning about the dangers of hot water.
Say 75 items in this script to teach a 25-page picture book.
All over Chicago in every kindergarten class in the city, every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day.
We know why these scripts are there.
We don't trust the judgment of teachers enough to let them loose on their own.
Scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster.
And they prevent disaster.
But what they assure in its place is mediocrity.
(Applause) Don't get me wrong. We need rules!
Jazz musicians need some notes -- most of them need some notes on the page.
We need more rules for the bankers, God knows.
But too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians from improvising.
And as a result, they lose their gifts, or worse, they stop playing altogether.
Now, how about incentives?
They seem cleverer.
If you have one reason for doing something and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing, it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one and you're more likely to do it.
Right?
Well, not always.
Sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another instead of complimenting, and they make people less likely to do it.
I'll just give you one example because time is racing.
In Switzerland, back about 15 years ago, they were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste dumps.
There was going to be a national referendum.
Some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed.
And they said, "Would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community?"
Astonishingly, 50 percent of the citizens said yes.
They knew it was dangerous.
They thought it would reduce their property values.
But it had to go somewhere and they had responsibilities as citizens.
The psychologists asked other people a slightly different question.
They said, "If we paid you six weeks' salary every year would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community?"
Two reasons. It's my responsibility and I'm getting paid.
Instead of 50 percent saying yes, 25 percent said yes.
What happens is that the second this introduction of incentive gets us so that instead of asking, "What is my responsibility?"
all we ask is, "What serves my interests?"
When incentives don't work, when CEOs ignore the long-term health of their companies in pursuit of short-term gains that will lead to massive bonuses, the response is always the same.
Get smarter incentives.
The truth is that there are no incentives that you can devise that are ever going to be smart enough.
Any incentive system can be subverted by bad will.
We need incentives. People have to make a living.
But excessive reliance on incentives demoralizes professional activity in two senses of that word.
It causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale and it causes the activity itself to lose morality.
Barack Obama said, before he was inaugurated, "We must ask not just 'Is it profitable?' but 'Is it right?'" And when professions are demoralized, everyone in them becomes dependent on -- addicted to -- incentives and they stop asking "Is it right?"
We see this in medicine.
("Although it's nothing serious, let's keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't turn into a major lawsuit.") And we certainly see it in the world of business.
("In order to remain competitive in today's marketplace, I'm afraid we're going to have to replace you with a sleezeball.") ("I sold my soul for about a tenth of what the damn things are going for now.") It is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work.
So what can we do?
A few sources of hope: we ought to try to re-moralize work.
One way not to do it: teach more ethics courses.
(Applause) There is no better way to show people that you're not serious than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course.
What to do instead?
One: Celebrate moral exemplars.
Acknowledge, when you go to law school, that a little voice is whispering in your ear about Atticus Finch.
No 10-year-old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions.
People are inspired by moral heroes.
But we learn that with sophistication comes the understanding that you can't acknowledge that you have moral heroes.
Well, acknowledge them.
Be proud that you have them.
Celebrate them.
And demand that the people who teach you acknowledge them and celebrate them too.
That's one thing we can do.
I don't know how many of you remember this: another moral hero, 15 years ago, Aaron Feuerstein, who was the head of Malden Mills in Massachusetts -- they made Polartec -- The factory burned down.
3,000 employees. He kept every one of them on the payroll.
Why? Because it would have been a disaster for them and for the community if he had let them go.
"Maybe on paper our company is worth less to Wall Street, but I can tell you it's worth more. We're doing fine."
Just at this TED we heard talks from several moral heroes.
Two were particularly inspiring to me.
One was Ray Anderson, who turned -- (Applause) -- turned, you know, a part of the evil empire into a zero-footprint, or almost zero-footprint business.
Why? Because it was the right thing to do.
And a bonus he's discovering is he's actually going to make even more money.
His employees are inspired by the effort.
Why? Because there happy to be doing something that's the right thing to do.
Yesterday we heard Willie Smits talk about re-foresting in Indonesia.
(Applause) In many ways this is the perfect example.
Because it took the will to do the right thing.
God knows it took a huge amount of technical skill.
I'm boggled at how much he and his associates needed to know in order to plot this out.
But most important to make it work -- and he emphasized this -- is that it took knowing the people in the communities.
Unless the people you're working with are behind you, this will fail.
And there isn't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you, because different people in different communities organize their lives in different ways.
So there's a lot here at TED, and at other places, to celebrate.
And you don't have to be a mega-hero.
There are ordinary heroes.
Ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too.
As practitioners each and every one of us should strive to be ordinary, if not extraordinary heroes.
As heads of organizations, we should strive to create environments that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will.
Even the wisest and most well-meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work.
If you run an organization, you should be sure that none of the jobs -- none of the jobs -- have job descriptions like the job descriptions of the janitors.
Because the truth is that any work that you do that involves interaction with other people is moral work.
And any moral work depends upon practical wisdom.
And, perhaps most important, as teachers, we should strive to be the ordinary heroes, the moral exemplars, to the people we mentor.
And there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers.
One is that we are always teaching.
Someone is always watching.
The camera is always on.
Bill Gates talked about the importance of education and, in particular, the model that KIPP was providing: "Knowledge is power."
And he talked about a lot of the wonderful things that KIPP is doing to take inner-city kids and turn them in the direction of college.
I want to focus on one particular thing KIPP is doing that Bill didn't mention.
That is that they have come to the realization that the single most important thing kids need to learn is character.
They need to learn to respect themselves.
They need to learn to respect their schoolmates.
They need to learn to respect their teachers.
And, most important, they need to learn to respect learning.
That's the principle objective.
If you do that, the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill.
And the teachers: the way you teach these things to the kids is by having the teachers and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day.
Obama appealed to virtue.
And I think he was right.
And the virtue I think we need above all others is practical wisdom, because it's what allows other virtues -- honesty, kindness, courage and so on -- to be displayed at the right time and in the right way.
He also appealed to hope.
Right again.
I think there is reason for hope.
I think people want to be allowed to be virtuous.
In many ways, it's what TED is all about.
Wanting to do the right thing in the right way for the right reasons.
This kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us if only we start paying attention.
Paying attention to what we do, to how we do it, and, perhaps most importantly, to the structure of the organizations within which we work, so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom rather than having it suppressed.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
(Applause) Chris Anderson: You have to go and stand out here a sec.
Barry Schwartz: Thank you very much.
(Applause)
So I've got something that I'm slightly embarrassed to admit to.
At the age of 17, as a creationist, I decided to go to university to study evolution so that I could destroy it.
(Laughter) I failed.
I failed so spectacularly that I'm now an evolutionary biologist.
(Applause) So I'm a paleoanthropologist, I'm a National Geographic Explorer specializing in fossil hunting in caves in unstable, hostile and disputed territories.
And we all know that if I was a guy and not a girl, that wouldn't be a job description, that would be a pick-up line.
(Laughter) Now, here's the thing. I do not have a death wish.
I'm not an adrenaline junkie.
I just looked at a map.
See, frontline exploratory science does not happen as much in politically unstable territories.
This is a map of all the places which the British Foreign Office have declared contain red zones, orange zones or have raised some kind of a threat warning about.
Now I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that it is a tragedy if we're not doing frontline exploratory science in a huge portion of the planet.
And so science has a geography problem.
Also, as a paleoanthropologist, guys, this is basically a map of some of the most important places in the human journey.
There are almost definitely fascinating fossils to be found here.
But are we looking for them?
And so as an undergraduate, I was repeatedly told that humans, be they ourselves, homo sapiens, or earlier species, that we left Africa via the Sinai of Egypt.
I'm English, as you can probably tell from my accent, but I am actually of Arab heritage, and I always say that I'm very, very Arab on the outside.
You know, I can really be passionate.
Like, "You're amazing! I love you!"
But on the inside, I'm really English, so everybody irritates me.
(Laughter) It's true.
And the thing is, my family are Arab from Yemen, and I knew that that channel, Bab-el-Mandeb, is not that much of a feat to cross.
And I kept asking myself this really simple question: if the ancestors to New World monkeys could somehow cross the Atlantic Ocean, why couldn't humans cross that tiny stretch of water?
But the thing is, Yemen, compared to, let's say, Europe, was so understudied that it was something akin to near virgin territory.
But that, along with its location, made the sheer potential for discovery so exciting, and I had so many questions.
When did we first start using Bab-el-Mandeb?
But also, which species of human besides ourselves made it to Yemen?
Might we find a species as yet unknown to science?
And it turned out, I wasn't the only one who had noticed Yemen's potential.
There was actually a few other academics out there.
But sadly, due to political instability, they moved out, and so I moved in.
And I was looking for caves: caves because caves are the original prime real estate.
But also because if you're looking for fossils in that kind of heat, your best bet for fossil preservation is always going to be caves.
But then, Yemen took a really sad turn for the worse, and just a few days before I was due to fly out to Yemen, the civil war escalated into a regional conflict, the capital's airport was bombed and Yemen became a no-fly zone.
Now, my parents made this decision before I was born: that I would be born British.
I had nothing to do with the best decision of my life.
And now ...
Now the lucky ones in my family have escaped, and the others, the others are being been bombed and send you WhatsApp messages that make you detest your very existence.
This war's been going on for four years.
It's been going on for over four years, and it has led to a humanitarian crisis.
There is a famine there, a man-made famine.
That's a man-made famine, so not a natural famine, an entirely man-made famine that the UN has warned could be the worst famine the world has seen in a hundred years.
This war has made it clear to me more than ever that no place, no people deserve to get left behind.
And so I was joining these other teams, and I was forming new collaborations in other unstable places.
But I was desperate to get back into Yemen, because for me, Yemen's really personal.
And so I kept trying to think of a project I could do in Yemen that would help highlight what was going on there.
And every idea I had just kept failing, or it was just too high-risk, because let's be honest, most of Yemen is just too dangerous for a Western team.
But then I was told that Socotra, a Yemeni island, was safe once you got there.
In fact, it turned out there was a few local and international academics that were still working there.
And that got me really excited, because look at Socotra's proximity to Africa.
And yet we have no idea when humans arrived on that island.
But Socotra, for those of you who know it, well, let's just say you probably know it for a completely different reason.
You probably know it as the Galapagos of the Indian Ocean, because it is one of the most biodiverse places on this earth.
But we were also getting information that this incredibly delicate environment and its people were under threat because they were at the frontline of both Middle Eastern politics and climate change.
And it slowly dawned on me that Socotra was my Yemen project.
And so I wanted to put together a huge multidisciplinary team.
We wanted to cross the archipelago on foot, camel and dhow boat to conduct a health check of this place.
This has only been attempted once before, and it was in 1999.
But the thing is, that is not an easy thing to pull off.
And so we desperately needed a recce, and for those of you who aren't familiar with British English, a recce is like a scouting expedition.
And I often say that a really big expedition without a recce is a bit like a first date without a Facebook stalk.
(Laughter) Like, it's doable, but is it wise?
(Laughter) There's a few too many knowing laughs in this room.
Anyway, so then our recce team thankfully were no strangers to unstable places, which, let's be honest, is kind of important because we were trying to get to a place between Yemen and Somalia, And after calling in what felt like a million favors, including to the deputy governor, we finally found ourselves on the move, albeit on a wooden cement cargo ship sailing through pirate waters in the Indian Ocean with this as a toilet.
(Laughter) Can you guys see this?
You know how everybody has their worst toilet story?
Well, I've never swam with dolphins before.
I just went straight to pooping on them.
(Laughter) And also, I genuinely discovered that I am genuinely less stressed by pirate waters than I am with a cockroach infestation that was so intense that at one point I went belowdeck, and the floor was black and it was moving.
(Audience moans) Yeah, and at night there was three raised platforms to sleep on, but there was only -- let's say there was four team members, and the thing is, if you got a raised platform to sleep on, you only had to contend with a few cockroaches during the night, whereas if you got the floor, good luck to you.
And so I was the only girl in the team and the whole ship, so I got away without sleeping on the floor.
And then, on, like, the fourth or fifth night, Martin Edström looks at me and goes, "Ella, Ella I really believe in equality."
(Laughter) So we were sailing on that cement cargo ship for three days, and then we slowly started seeing land.
And after three years of failing, I was finally seeing Yemen.
And there is no feeling on earth like that start of an expedition.
It's this moment where you jump out of a jeep or you look up from a boat and you know that there's this possibility, it's small but it's still there, that you're about to find something that could add to or change our knowledge of who we are and where we come from.
There is no feeling like it on earth, and it's a feeling that so many scientists have but rarely in politically unstable places.
Because Western scientists are discouraged or all-out barred from working in unstable places.
But here's the thing: scientists specialize in the jungle.
Scientists work in deep cave systems.
Scientists attach themselves to rockets and blow themselves into outer space.
But apparently, working in an unstable place is deemed too high-risk.
It is completely arbitrary.
Who here in this room wasn't brought up on adventure stories?
And most of our heroes were actually scientists and academics.
Science was about going out into the unknown.
It was about truly global exploration, even if there were risks.
And so when did it become acceptable to make it difficult for science to happen in unstable places?
And look, I'm not saying that all scientists should go off and start working in unstable places.
But here's the thing: for those who have done the research, understand security protocol and are trained, stop stopping those who want to.
Plus, just because one part of a country is an active war zone doesn't mean the whole country is.
I'm not saying we should go into active war zones.
But Iraqi Kurdistan looks very different from Fallujah.
And actually, a few months after I couldn't get into Yemen, another team adopted me.
So Professor Graeme Barker's team were actually working in Iraqi Kurdistan, and they were digging up Shanidar Cave.
Now, Shanidar Cave a few decades earlier had unveiled a Neanderthal known as Shanidar 1.
Now, for a BBC/PBS TV series we actually brought Shanidar 1 to life, and I want you guys to meet Ned, Ned the Neanderthal.
Now here's the coolest thing about Ned.
Ned, this guy, you're meeting him before his injuries.
See, it turned out that Ned was severely disabled.
He was in fact so disabled that there is no way he could have survived without the help of other Neanderthals.
And so this was proof that, at least for this population of Neanderthals at this time, Neanderthals were like us, and they sometimes looked after those who couldn't look after themselves.
Ned's an Iraqi Neanderthal.
So what else are we missing?
What incredible scientific discoveries are we not making because we're not looking?
And by the way, these places, they deserve narratives of hope, and science and exploration can be a part of that.
In fact, I would argue that it can tangibly aid development, and these discoveries become a huge source of local pride.
And that brings me to the second reason why science has a geography problem.
See, we don't empower local academics, do we?
Like, it's not lost on me that in my particular field of paleoanthropology we study human origins, but we have so few diverse scientists.
And the thing is, these places are full of students and academics who are desperate to collaborate, and the truth is that for them, they have fewer security issues than us.
I think we constantly forget that for them it's not a hostile environment; for them it's home.
I'm telling you, research done in unstable places with local collaborators can lead to incredible discoveries, and that is what we are hoping upon hope to do in Socotra.
They call Socotra the most alien-looking place on earth, and myself, Leon McCarron, Martin Edström and Rhys Thwaites-Jones could see why.
I mean, look at this place.
These places, they're not hellholes, they're not write-offs, they're the future frontline of science and exploration.
90 percent of the reptiles on this island, 37 percent of the plant species exist here and nowhere else on earth, and that includes this species of dragon's blood tree, which actually bleeds this red resin.
And there's something else.
People on Socotra, some of them still live in caves, and that is really exciting, because it means if a cave is prime real estate this century, maybe it was a few thousand years ago.
But we need the data to prove it, the fossils, the stone tools, and so our scouting team have teamed up with other scientists, anthropologists and storytellers, international as well as local, like Ahmed Alarqbi, and we are desperate to shed a light on this place before it's too late.
And now, now we just somehow need to get back for that really big expedition, because science, science has a geography problem.
You guys have been a really lovely audience.
Thank you.
(Applause)
There's a great big elephant in the room called the economy.
So let's start talking about that.
I wanted to give you a current picture of the economy.
That's what I have behind myself.
(Laughter) But of course what we have to remember is this.
And what you have to think about is, when you're dancing in the flames, what's next?
So what I'm going to try to do in the next 17 and a half minutes is I'm going to talk first about the flames -- where we are in the economy -- and then I'm going to take three trends that have taken place at TED over the last 25 years and that will take place in this conference and I will try and bring them together.
And I will try and give you a sense of what the ultimate reboot looks like.
Those three trends are the ability to engineer cells, the ability to engineer tissues, and robots.
And somehow it will all make sense.
But anyway, let's start with the economy.
There's a couple of really big problems that are still sitting there.
One is leverage.
And the problem with leverage is it makes the U.S. financial system look like this.
(Laughter) So, a normal commercial bank has nine to 10 times leverage.
That means for every dollar you deposit, it loans out about nine or 10.
A normal investment bank is not a deposit bank, it's an investment bank; it has 15 to 20 times.
It turns out that B of A in September had 32 times.
And your friendly Citibank had 47 times.
Oops.
That means every bad loan goes bad 47 times over.
And that, of course, is the reason why all of you are making such generous and wonderful donations to these nice folks.
And as you think about that, you've got to wonder: so what do banks have in store for you now?
(Laughter) It ain't pretty.
The government, meanwhile, has been acting like Santa Claus.
We all love Santa Claus, right?
But the problem with Santa Clause is, if you look at the mandatory spending of what these folks have been doing and promising folks, it turned out that in 1967, 38 percent was mandatory spending on what we call "entitlements."
And then by 2007 it was 68 percent.
And we weren't supposed to run into 100 percent until about 2030.
Except we've been so busy giving away a trillion here, a trillion there, that we've brought that date of reckoning forward to about 2017.
And we thought we were going to be able to lay these debts off on our kids, but, guess what?
We're going to start to pay them.
And the problem with this stuff is, now that the bill's come due, it turns out Santa isn't quite as cute when it's summertime.
Right?
(Laughter) Here's some advice from one of the largest investors in the United States.
This guy runs the China Investment Corporation.
He is the main buyer of U.S. Treasury bonds.
And he gave an interview in December.
Here's his first bit of advice.
And here's his second bit of advice.
And, by the way, the Chinese Prime Minister reiterated this at Davos last Sunday.
This stuff is getting serious enough that if we don't start paying attention to the deficit, we're going to end up losing the dollar.
And then all bets are off.
Let me show you what it looks like.
I think I can safely say that I'm the only trillionaire in this room.
This is an actual bill.
And it's 10 triliion dollars.
The only problem with this bill is it's not really worth very much.
That was eight bucks last week, four bucks this week, a buck next week.
And that's what happens to currencies when you don't stand behind them.
So the next time somebody as cute as this shows up on your doorstep, and sometimes this creature's called Chrysler and sometimes Ford and sometimes ... whatever you want -- you've just got to say no.
And you've got to start banishing a word that's called "entitlement."
And the reason we have to do that in the short term is because we have just run out of cash.
If you look at the federal budget, this is what it looks like.
The orange slice is what's discretionary.
Everything else is mandated.
It makes no difference if we cut out the bridges to Alaska in the overall scheme of things.
So what we have to start thinking about doing is capping our medical spending because that's a monster that's simply going to eat the entire budget.
We've got to start thinking about asking people to retire a little bit later.
If you're 60 to 65 you retire on time.
Your 401(k) just got nailed.
If you're 50 to 60 we want you to work two years more.
If you're under 50 we want you to work four more years.
The reason why that's reasonable is, when your grandparents were given Social Security, they got it at 65 and were expected to check out at 68.
Sixty-eight is young today.
We've also got to cut the military about three percent a year.
We've got to limit other mandatory spending.
We've got to quit borrowing as much, because otherwise the interest is going to eat that whole pie.
And we've got to end up with a smaller government.
And if we don't start changing this trend line, we are going to lose the dollar and start to look like Iceland.
I got what you're thinking.
This is going to happen when hell freezes over.
But let me remind you this December it did snow in Vegas.
(Laughter) Here's what happens if you don't address this stuff.
So, Japan had a fiscal real estate crisis back in the late '80s.
And its 225 largest companies today are worth one quarter of what they were 18 years ago.
We don't fix this now, how would you like to see a Dow 3,500 in 2026?
Because that's the consequence of not dealing with this stuff.
And unless you want this person to not just become the CFO of Florida, but the United States, we'd better deal with this stuff.
That's the short term. That's the flame part.
That's the financial crisis.
Now, right behind the financial crisis there's a second and bigger wave that we need to talk about.
That wave is much larger, much more powerful, and that's of course the wave of technology.
And what's really important in this stuff is, as we cut, we also have to grow.
Among other things, because startup companies are .02 percent of U.S. GDP investmentm and they're about 17.8 percent of output.
It's groups like that in this room that generate the future of the U.S. economy.
And that's what we've got to keep growing.
We don't have to keep growing these bridges to nowhere.
So let's bring a romance novelist into this conversation.
And that's where these three trends come together.
That's where the ability to engineer microbes, the ability to engineer tissues, and the ability to engineer robots begin to lead to a reboot.
And let me recap some of the stuff you've seen.
Craig Venter showed up last year and showed you the first fully programmable cell that acts like hardware where you can insert DNA and have it boot up as a different species.
In parallel, the folks at MIT have been building a standard registry of biological parts.
So think of it as a Radio Shack for biology.
You can go out and get your proteins, your RNA, your DNA, whatever.
And start building stuff.
In 2006 they brought together high school students and college students and started to build these little odd creatures.
They just happened to be alive instead of circuit boards.
Here was one of the first things they built.
So, cells have this cycle.
First they don't grow.
Then they grow exponentially.
Then they stop growing.
Graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in.
So they engineered these cells so that when they're growing in the exponential phase, they would smell like wintergreen.
And when they stopped growing they would smell like bananas.
And you could tell very easily when your experiment was working and wasn't, and where it was in the phase.
This got a bit more complicated two years later.
Twenty-one countries came together. Dozens of teams.
They started competing.
The team from Rice University started to engineer the substance in red wine that makes red wine good for you into beer.
So you take resveratrol and you put it into beer.
Of course, one of the judges is wandering by, and he goes, "Wow! Cancer-fighting beer! There is a God."
(Laughter) The team from Taiwan was a little bit more ambitious.
They tried to engineer bacterias in such a way that they would act as your kidneys.
Four years ago, I showed you this picture.
And people oohed and ahhed, because Cliff Tabin had been able to grow an extra wing on a chicken.
And that was very cool stuff back then.
But now moving from bacterial engineering to tissue engineering, let me show you what's happened in that period of time.
Two years ago, you saw this creature.
An almost-extinct animal from Xochimilco, Mexico called an axolotl that can re-generate its limbs.
You can freeze half its heart. It regrows.
You can freeze half the brain. It regrows.
It's almost like leaving Congress.
(Laughter) But now, you don't have to have the animal itself to regenerate, because you can build cloned mice molars in Petri dishes.
And, of course if you can build mice molars in Petri dishes, you can grow human molars in Petri dishes.
This should not surprise you, right?
I mean, you're born with no teeth.
You give away all your teeth to the tooth fairy.
You re-grow a set of teeth.
But then if you lose one of those second set of teeth, they don't regrow, unless, if you're a lawyer.
(Laughter) But, of course, for most of us, we know how to grow teeth, and therefore we can take adult stem teeth, put them on a biodegradable mold, re-grow a tooth, and simply implant it.
And we can do it with other things.
So, a Spanish woman who was dying of T.B. had a donor trachea, they took all the cells off the trachea, they spraypainted her stem cells onto that cartilage.
She regrew her own trachea, and 72 hours later it was implanted.
She's now running around with her kids.
This is going on in Tony Atala's lab in Wake Forest where he is re-growing ears for injured soldiers, and he's also re-growing bladders.
So there are now nine women walking around Boston with re-grown bladders, which is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bags for the rest of your life.
This is kind of getting boring, right?
I mean, you understand where this story's going.
But, I mean it gets more interesting.
Last year, this group was able to take all the cells off a heart, leaving just the cartilage.
Then, they sprayed stem cells onto that heart, from a mouse.
Those stem cells self-organized, and that heart started to beat.
Life happens.
This may be one of the ultimate papers.
This was done in Japan and in the U.S., published at the same time, and it rebooted skin cells into stem cells, last year.
That meant that you can take the stuff right here, and turn it into almost anything in your body.
And this is becoming common, it's moving very quickly, it's moving in a whole series of places.
Third trend: robots.
Those of us of a certain age grew up expecting that by now we would have Rosie the Robot from "The Jetsons" in our house.
And all we've got is a Roomba.
(Laughter) We also thought we'd have this robot to warn us of danger.
Didn't happen.
And these were robots engineered for a flat world, right?
So, Rosie runs around on skates and the other one ran on flat threads.
If you don't have a flat world, that's not good, which is why the robot's we're designing today are a little different.
This is Boston Dynamics' "BigDog."
And this is about as close as you can get to a physical Turing test.
O.K., so let me remind you, a Turing test is where you've got a wall, you're talking to somebody on the other side of the wall, and when you don't know if that thing is human or animal -- that's when computers have reached human intelligence.
This is not an intelligence Turing rest, but this is as close as you can get to a physical Turing test.
And this stuff is moving very quickly, and by the way, that thing can carry about 350 pounds of weight.
These are not the only interesting robots.
You've also got flies, the size of flies, that are being made by Robert Wood at Harvard.
You've got Stickybots that are being made at Stanford.
And as you bring these things together, as you bring cells, biological tissue engineering and mechanics together, you begin to get some really odd questions.
In the last Olympics, this gentleman, who had several world records in the Special Olympics, tried to run in the normal Olympics.
The only issue with Oscar Pistorius is he was born without bones in the lower part of his legs.
He came within about a second of qualifying.
He sued to be allowed to run, and he won the suit, but didn't qualify by time.
Next Olympics, you can bet that Oscar, or one of Oscar's successors, is going to make the time.
And two or three Olympics after that, they are going to be unbeatable.
And as you bring these trends together, and as you think of what it means to take people who are profoundly deaf, who can now begin to hear -- I mean, remember the evolution of hearing aids, right?
I mean, your grandparents had these great big cones, and then your parents had these odd boxes that would squawk at odd times during dinner, and now we have these little buds that nobody sees.
And now you have cochlear implants that go into people's heads and allow the deaf to begin to hear.
Now, they can't hear as well as you and I can.
But, in 10 or 15 machine generations they will, and these are machine generations, not human generations.
And about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and I can, they'll be able to hear maybe how bats sing, or how whales talk, or how dogs talk, and other types of tonal scales.
They'll be able to focus their hearing, they'll be able to increase the sensitivity, decrease the sensitivity, do a series of things that we can't do.
And the same thing is happening in eyes.
This is a group in Germany that's beginning to engineer eyes so that people who are blind can begin to see light and dark.
Very primitive.
And then they'll be able to see shape.
And then they'll be able to see color, and then they'll be able to see in definition, and one day, they'll see as well as you and I can.
And a couple of years after that, they'll be able to see in ultraviolet, they'll be able to see in infrared, they'll be able to focus their eyes, they'll be able to come into a microfocus.
They'll do stuff you and I can't do.
All of these things are coming together, and it's a particularly important thing to understand, as we worry about the flames of the present, to keep an eye on the future.
And, of course, the future is looking back 200 years, because next week is the 200th anniversary of Darwin's birth.
And it's the 150th anniversary of the publication of "The Origin of Species."
And Darwin, of course, argued that evolution is a natural state.
It is a natural state in everything that is alive, including hominids.
There have actually been 22 species of hominids that have been around, have evolved, have wandered in different places, have gone extinct.
It is common for hominids to evolve.
And that's the reason why, as you look at the hominid fossil record, erectus, and heidelbergensis, and floresiensis, and Neanderthals, and Homo sapiens, all overlap.
The common state of affairs is to have overlapping versions of hominids, not one.
And as you think of the implications of that, here's a brief history of the universe.
The universe was created 13.7 billion years ago, and then you created all the stars, and all the planets, and all the galaxies, and all the Milky Ways.
And then you created Earth about 4.5 billion years ago, and then you got life about four billion years ago, and then you got hominids about 0.006 billion years ago, and then you got our version of hominids about 0.0015 billion years ago.
Ta-dah!
Maybe the reason for thr creation of the universe, and all the galaxies, and all the planets, and all the energy, and all the dark energy, and all the rest of stuff is to create what's in this room.
Maybe not.
That would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint.
(Laughter) So, if that's not the purpose of the universe, then what's next?
(Laughter) I think what we're going to see is we're going to see a different species of hominid.
I think we're going to move from a Homo sapiens into a Homo evolutis.
And I think this isn't 1,000 years out.
I think most of us are going to glance at it, and our grandchildren are going to begin to live it.
And a Homo evolutis brings together these three trends into a hominid that takes direct and deliberate control over the evolution of his species, her species and other species.
And that, of course, would be the ultimate reboot.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: Let's now see the extraordinary speech that we captured a couple weeks ago.
(Music) Jose Antonio Abreu: My dear friends, ladies and gentlemen, I am overjoyed today at being awarded the TED Prize on behalf of all the distinguished music teachers, artists and educators from Venezuela who have selflessly and loyally accompanied me for 35 years in founding, growing and developing in Venezuela the National System of Youth and Children's Orchestras and Choirs.
Since I was a boy, in my early childhood, I always wanted to be a musician, and, thank God, I made it.
From my teachers, my family and my community, I had all the necessary support to become a musician.
All my life I've dreamed that all Venezuelan children have the same opportunity that I had.
From that desire and from my heart stemmed the idea to make music a deep and global reality for my country.
From the very first rehearsal, I saw the bright future ahead.
Because the rehearsal meant a great challenge to me.
I had received a donation of 50 music stands to be used by 100 boys in that rehearsal.
When I arrived at the rehearsal, only 11 kids had shown up, and I said to myself, "Do I close the program or multiply these kids?"
I decided to face the challenge, and on that same night, I promised those 11 children I'd turn our orchestra into one of the leading orchestras in the world.
Two months ago, I remembered that promise I made, when a distinguished English critic published an article in the London Times, asking who could be the winner of the Orchestra World Cup.
He mentioned four great world orchestras, and the fifth one was Venezuela's Youth Symphony Orchestra.
Today we can say that art in Latin America is no longer a monopoly of elites and that it has become a social right, a right for all the people.
Child: There is no difference here between classes, nor white or black, nor if you have money or not.
Simply, if you are talented, if you have the vocation and the will to be here, you get in. You share with us and make music.
JA: During the recent tour by the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra of Venezuela of U.S. and Europe, we saw how our music moved young audiences to the bottom of their souls, how children and adolescents rushed up to the stage to receive the jackets from our musicians, how the standing ovations, sometimes 30 minutes long, seemed to last forever, and how the public, after the concert was over, went out into the street to greet our young people in triumph.
This meant not only an artistic triumph, but also a profound emotional sympathy between the public of the most advanced nations of the world and the musical youth of Latin America, as seen in Venezuela, giving these audiences a message of music, vitality, energy, enthusiasm and strength.
In its essence, the orchestra and the choir are much more than artistic structures.
They are examples and schools of social life, because to sing and to play together means to intimately coexist toward perfection and excellence, following a strict discipline of organization and coordination in order to seek the harmonic interdependence of voices and instruments.
That's how they build a spirit of solidarity and fraternity among them, develop their self-esteem and foster the ethical and aesthetical values related to the music in all its senses.
This is why music is immensely important in the awakening of sensibility, in the forging of values and in the training of youngsters to teach other kids.
Child: After all this time here, music is life.
Nothing else.
Music is life.
JA: Each teenager and child in El Sistema has his own story, and they are all important and of great significance to me.
Let me mention the case of Edicson Ruiz.
He is a boy from a parish in Caracas who passionately attended to his double bass lessons at the San Agustin's Junior Orchestra.
With his effort, and the support of his mother, his family and his community, he became a principal member in the double bass segment of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.
We have another well-known case -- Gustavo Dudamel.
He started as a boy member of the children's orchestra in his hometown, Barquisimeto.
There, he grew as a violinist and as a conductor.
He became the conductor of Venezuela's junior orchestras, and today conducts the world's greatest orchestras.
He is the musical director of Los Angeles Philharmonic, and is still the overall leader of Venezuela's junior orchestras.
He was the conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, and he's an unbeatable example for young musicians in Latin America and the world.
The structure of El Sistema is based on a new and flexible managing style adapted to the features of each community and region, and today attends to 300,000 children of the lower and middle class all over Venezuela.
It's a program of social rescue and deep cultural transformation designed for the whole Venezuelan society with absolutely no distinctions whatsoever, but emphasizing the vulnerable and endangered social groups.
The effect of El Sistema is felt in three fundamental circles: in the personal/social circle, in the family circle and in the community.
In the personal/social circle, the children in the orchestras and choirs develop their intellectual and emotional side.
The music becomes a source for developing the dimensions of the human being, thus elevating the spirit and leading man to a full development of his personality.
So, the emotional and intellectual profits are huge -- the acquisition of leadership, teaching and training principles, the sense of commitment, responsibility, generosity and dedication to others, and the individual contribution to achieve great collective goals.
All this leads to the development of self-esteem and confidence.
Mother Teresa of Calcutta insisted on something that always impressed me: the most miserable and tragic thing about poverty is not the lack of bread or roof, but the feeling of being no-one -- the feeling of not being anyone, the lack of identification, the lack of public esteem.
That's why the child's development in the orchestra and the choir provides him with a noble identity and makes him a role model for his family and community.
It makes him a better student at school because it inspires in him a sense of responsibility, perseverance and punctuality that will greatly help him at school.
Within the family, the parents' support is unconditional.
The child becomes a role model for both his parents, and this is very important for a poor child.
Once the child discovers he is important to his family, he begins to seek new ways of improving himself and hopes better for himself and his community.
Also, he hopes for social and economic improvements for his own family.
All this makes up a constructive and ascending social dynamic.
The large majority of our children belong, as I already mentioned, to the most vulnerable strata of the Venezuelan population.
That encourages them to embrace new dreams, new goals, and progress in the various opportunities that music has to offer.
Finally, in the circle of the community, the orchestras prove to be the creative spaces of culture and sources of exchange and new meanings.
The spontaneity music has excludes it as a luxury item and makes it a patrimony of society.
It's what makes a child play a violin at home, while his father works in his carpentry.
It's what makes a little girl play the clarinet at home, while her mother does the housework.
The idea is that the families join with pride and joy in the activities of the orchestras and the choirs that their children belong to.
The huge spiritual world that music produces in itself, which also lies within itself, ends up overcoming material poverty.
From the minute a child's taught how to play an instrument, he's no longer poor.
He becomes a child in progress heading for a professional level, who'll later become a full citizen.
Needless to say that music is the number one prevention against prostitution, violence, bad habits, and everything degrading in the life of a child.
A few years ago, historian Arnold Toynbee said that the world was suffering a huge spiritual crisis.
Not an economic or social crisis, but a spiritual one.
I believe that to confront such a crisis, only art and religion can give proper answers to humanity, to mankind's deepest aspirations, and to the historic demands of our times.
Education -- the synthesis of wisdom and knowledge -- is the means to strive for a more perfect, more aware, more noble and more just society.
With passion and enthusiasm we pay profound respects to TED for its outstanding humanism, the scope of its principles, for its open and generous promotion of young values.
We hope that TED can contribute in a full and fundamental way to the building of this new era in the teaching of music, in which the social, communal, spiritual and vindicatory aims of the child and the adolescent become a beacon and a goal for a vast social mission.
No longer putting society at the service of art, and much less at the services of monopolies of the elite, but instead art at the service of society, at the service of the weakest, at the service of the children, at the service of the sick, at the service of the vulnerable, and at the service of all those who cry for vindication through the spirit of their human condition and the raising up of their dignity.
(Music) (Applause) CA: We are going live now to Caracas.
We are going live to Caracas to hear Maestro Abreu's TED Prize wish.
JA: Here is my TED Prize wish: I wish that you'll help to create and document a special training program for 50 gifted young musicians, passionate about their art and social justice, and dedicated to bringing El Sistema to the United States and other countries.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
15th century Europeans believed they had hit upon a miracle cure: a remedy for epilepsy, hemorrhage, bruising, nausea, and virtually any other medical ailment.
This brown powder could be mixed into drinks, made into salves or eaten straight up.
It was known as mumia and made by grinding up mummified human flesh.
The word "cannibal" dates from the time of Christopher Columbus; in fact, Columbus may even have coined it himself.
After coming ashore on the island of Guadaloupe, Columbus' initial reports back to the Queen of Spain described the indigenous people as friendly and peaceful— though he did mention rumors of a group called the Caribs, who made violent raids and then cooked and ate their prisoners.
In response, Queen Isabella granted permission to capture and enslave anyone who ate human flesh.
When the island failed to produce the gold Columbus was looking for, he began to label anyone who resisted his plundering and kidnapping as a Caribe.
Somewhere along the way, the word "Carib" became "Canibe" and then "Cannibal."
First used by colonizers to dehumanize indigenous people, it has since been applied to anyone who eats human flesh.
So the term comes from an account that wasn't based on hard evidence, but cannibalism does have a real and much more complex history.
It has taken diverse forms— sometimes, as with mumia, it doesn't involved recognizable parts of the human body.
The reasons for cannibalistic practices have varied, too.
Across cultures and time periods, there's evidence of survival cannibalism, when people living through a famine, siege or ill-fated expedition had to either eat the bodies of the dead or starve to death themselves.
But it's also been quite common for cultures to normalize some form of eating human flesh under ordinary circumstances.
Because of false accounts like Columbus's, it's difficult to say exactly how common cultural cannibalism has been— but there are still some examples of accepted cannibalistic practices from within the cultures practicing them.
Take the medicinal cannibalism in Europe during Columbus's time.
Starting in the 15th century, the demand for mumia increased.
At first, stolen mummies from Egypt supplied the mumia craze, but soon the demand was too great to be sustained on Egyptian mummies alone, and opportunists stole bodies from European cemeteries to turn into mumia.
Use of mumia continued for hundreds of years.
It was listed in the Merck index, a popular medical encyclopedia, into the 20th century.
And ground up mummies were far from the only remedy made from human flesh that was common throughout Europe.
Blood, in either liquid or powdered form, was used to treat epilepsy, while human liver, gall stones, oil distilled from human brains, and pulverized hearts were popular medical concoctions.
In China, the written record of socially accepted cannibalism goes back almost 2,000 years.
One particularly common form of cannibalism appears to have been filial cannibalism, where adult sons and daughters would offer a piece of their own flesh to their parents.
This was typically offered as a last-ditch attempt to cure a sick parent, and wasn't fatal to their offspring— it usually involved flesh from the thigh or, less often, a finger.
Cannibalistic funerary rites are another form of culturally sanctioned cannibalism.
Perhaps the best-known example came from the Fore people of New Guinea.
Through the mid-20th century, members of the community would, if possible, make their funerary preferences known in advance, sometimes requesting that family members gather to consume the body after death.
Tragically, though these rituals honored the deceased, they also spread a deadly disease known as kuru through the community.
Between the fictionalized stories, verifiable practices, and big gaps that still exist in our knowledge, there's no one history of cannibalism.
But we do know that people have been eating each other, volunteering themselves to be eaten, and accusing others of eating people for millennia.
At a Maryland country fair in 2017, the prize pigs were not looking their best.
Farmers reported feverish hogs with inflamed eyes and running snouts.
But while fair officials worried about the pigs, the Maryland department of health was concerned about a group of sick fairgoers.
Some had pet the pigs, while others had merely been near their barns; but soon, 40 of these attendees would be diagnosed with swine flu.
More often than not, sick animals don’t infect humans.
But when they do, these cross-species infections, or viral host jumps, have the potential to produce deadly epidemics.
So how can pathogens from one species infect another, and what makes host jumps so dangerous?
Viruses are a type of organic parasite infecting nearly all forms of life.
To survive and reproduce, they must move through three stages: contact with a susceptible host, infection and replication, and transmission to other individuals.
As an example, let’s look at human influenza.
First, the flu virus encounters a new host and makes its way into their respiratory tract.
This isn’t so difficult, but to survive in this new body, the virus must mount a successful infection before it’s caught and broken down by an immune response.
To accomplish this task, viruses have evolved specific interactions with their host species.
Human flu viruses are covered in proteins adapted to bind with matching receptors on human respiratory cells.
Once inside a cell, the virus employs additional adaptations to hijack the host cell’s reproductive machinery and replicate its own genetic material.
Now the virus only needs to suppress or evade the host’s immune system long enough to replicate to sufficient levels and infect more cells.
At this point, the flu can be passed on to its next victim via any transmission of infected bodily fluid.
However, this simple sneeze also brings the virus in contact with pets, plants, or even your lunch.
Viruses are constantly encountering new species and attempting to infect them.
More often than not, this ends in failure.
In most cases, the genetic dissimilarity between the two hosts is too great.
For a virus adapted to infect humans, a lettuce cell would be a foreign and inhospitable landscape.
But there are a staggering number of viruses circulating in the environment, all with the potential to encounter new hosts.
And because viruses rapidly reproduce by the millions, they can quickly develop random mutations.
Most mutations will have no effect, or even prove detrimental; but a small proportion may enable the pathogen to better infect a new species.
The odds of winning this destructive genetic lottery increase over time, or if the new species is closely related to the virus’ usual host.
For a virus adapted to another mammal, infecting a human might just take a few lucky mutations.
And a virus adapted to chimpanzees, one of our closest genetic relatives, might barely require any changes at all.
It takes more than time and genetic similarity for a host jump to be successful.
Some viruses come equipped to easily infect a new host’s cells, but are then unable to evade an immune response.
Others might have a difficult time transmitting to new hosts.
For example, they might make the host’s blood contagious, but not their saliva.
However, once a host jump reaches the transmission stage, the virus becomes much more dangerous.
Now gestating within two hosts, the pathogen has twice the odds of mutating into a more successful virus.
And each new host increases the potential for a full-blown epidemic.
Virologists are constantly looking for mutations that might make viruses such as influenza more likely to jump.
However, predicting the next potential epidemic is a major challenge.
There’s a huge diversity of viruses that we’re only just beginning to uncover.
Researchers are tirelessly studying the biology of these pathogens.
And by monitoring populations to quickly identify new outbreaks, they can develop vaccines and containment protocols to stop these deadly diseases.
It was the largest contiguous land empire in history— stretching from Korea to Ukraine and from Siberia to southern China, and was forged on the open plains.
In the 12th century CE, before the Mongol Empire formed, the East Asian steppe was home to scattered groups of Mongol and Turkic pastoral nomads led by Khans.
The people herded sheep, cattle, yaks and camels.
They lived in felt tents and moved between summer and winter campsites.
Nomadic women held significant authority, managing these migrations, many of the flocks and trade.
Meanwhile, men specialized in mounted warfare.
These nomadic groups often fought each other.
That was to change under Temujin, who was born into an aristocratic Mongol family.
Despite losing his father at an early age and growing up in poverty, he quickly rose to power by forging strategic alliances with other leaders.
Unlike those khans, Temujin promoted soldiers based on merit and distributed spoils evenly among them.
His most brilliant move was to scatter the nomads he conquered among his own soldiers so they couldn't join together against him.
These innovations made him unstoppable, and by 1206, he had united the people of the felt-walled tents and become Chinggis Khan.
The Mongols were shamanists, believing that the spirits of nature and their ancestors inhabited the world around them.
Over all arched the Sky god Tenggeri.
Chinggis Khan believed that Tenggeri wanted him to conquer the entire world in his name.
With the nomads of the Mongolian plain united, this seemed within reach.
Anyone who resisted the Mongols was resisting Tenggeri's will, and for this insubordination, had to die.
Under Chinggis Khan, the Mongols first subdued northern China and the eastern Islamic lands.
After his death in 1227, the Divine Mandate passed to his family, or the Golden Lineage.
In the 1230s, Chinggis Khan's sons and daughters conquered the Turks of Central Asia and the Russian princes, then destroyed two European armies in 1241.
In the 1250s, the Mongols seized Islamic territory as far as Baghdad, while in the East their grasp reached southern China by 1279.
Life within the Mongol Empire wasn't just war, pillage and destruction.
Once the Mongols conquered a territory, they left its internal politics alone and used local administrators to govern for them.
The Mongols let all religions flourish, as long as the leaders prayed for them.
Although they routinely captured artisans, scholars and engineers, they appreciated what those specialists could do and forcibly settled them across Asia to continue their work.
The most valuable produce in the Empire was gold brocade, which took silk from China, gold from Tibet and weavers from Baghdad.
Gold brocade clothed the Mongol rulers, covered their horses and lined their tents.
The Mongols particularly prized gunpowder technicians from China.
With much of Eurasia politically unified, trade flourished along the Silk Road, helped by an extensive system of horse messengers and relay posts.
Robust trade continued at sea, especially in blue-and-white porcelain, which combined white pottery from Mongol China with blue dye from Mongol Iran.
But this was not to last.
Succession to the Great Khan didn't automatically go to the eldest son, but rather allowed brothers, uncles and cousins to vie for leadership with senior widows acting as regents for their sons.
By the 1260s, Chinggis Khan's grandsons were in a full- blown civil war over inheritance and fragmented the realm into four separate empires.
In China, Kublai Khan's Yuan Dynasty is remembered as a golden age of science and culture.
In Iran, the Ilkhanate inaugurated the development of new monumental architecture and Persian miniature painting.
In Central Asia, the Chagatai Khanate brought forth leaders like Timur and his descendant Babur, who founded the Mughal Empire in India.
And in Eastern Europe, the Golden Horde ruled for years until a trading post named Muscovy grew into a major world power.
Even though the Empire lasted only a short while, the Mongols left a legacy of world- domination that remains unmatched today.
So this is the first time I've told this story in public, the personal aspects of it.
Yogi Berra was a world-famous baseball player who said, "If you come to a fork in the road, take it."
Researchers had been, for more than a century, studying the immune system as a way to fight cancer, and cancer vaccines have, unfortunately, been disappointing.
They've only worked in cancers caused by viruses, like cervical cancer or liver cancer.
So cancer researchers basically gave up on the idea of using the immune system to fight cancer.
And the immune system, in any case, did not evolve to fight cancer; it evolved to fight pathogens invading from the outside.
So its job is to kill bacteria and viruses.
And the reason the immune system has trouble with most cancers is that it doesn't invade from the outside; it evolves from its own cells.
And so either the immune system does not recognize the cancer as a problem, or it attacks a cancer and also our normal cells, leading to autoimmune diseases like colitis or multiple sclerosis.
So how do you get around that?
Our answer turned out to be synthetic immune systems that are designed to recognize and kill cancer cells.
That's right -- I said a synthetic immune system.
You do that with genetic engineering and synthetic biology.
We did it with the naturally occurring parts of the immune system, called B cells and T cells.
These were our building blocks.
T cells have evolved to kill cells infected with viruses, and B cells are the cells that make antibodies that are secreted and then bind to kill bacteria.
Well, what if you combined these two functions in a way that was designed to repurpose them to fight cancer?
We realized it would be possible to insert the genes for antibodies from B cells into T cells.
So how do you do that?
Well, we used an HIV virus as a Trojan horse to get past the T cells' immune system.
The result is a chimera, a fantastic fire-breathing creature from Greek mythology, with a lion's head, a goat's body and a serpent's tail.
So we decided that the paradoxical thing that we had created with our B-cell antibodies, our T cells carrier and the HIV Trojan horse should be called "Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells," or CAR T cells.
The virus also inserts genetic information to activate the T cells and program them into their killing mode.
So when CAR T cells are injected into somebody with cancer, what happens when those CAR T cells see and bind to their tumor target?
They act like supercharged killer T cells on steroids.
They start this crash-defense buildup system in the body and literally divide and multiply by the millions, where they then attack and kill the tumor.
All of this means that CAR T cells are the first living drug in medicine.
CAR T cells break the mold.
Unlike normal drugs that you take -- they do their job and get metabolized, and then you have to take them again -- CAR T cells stay alive and on the job for years.
We have had CAR T cells stay in the bodies of our cancer patients now for more than eight years.
And these designer cancer T cells, CAR T cells, have a calculated half-life of more than 17 years.
So one infusion can do the job; they stay on patrol for the rest of your life.
This is the beginning of a new paradigm in medicine.
Now, there was one major challenge to these T-cell infusions.
The only source of T cells that will work in a patient are your own T cells, unless you happen to have an identical twin.
So for most of us, we're out of luck.
So what we did was to make CAR T cells.
We had to learn to grow the patient's own T cells.
And we developed a robust platform for this in the 1990s.
Then in 1997, we first tested CAR T cells in patients with advanced HIV-AIDS.
And we found that those CAR T cells survived in the patients for more than a decade.
And it improved their immune system and decreased their viruses, but it didn't cure them.
So we went back to the laboratory, and over the next decade made improvements to the CAR T cell design.
And by 2010, we began treating leukemia patients.
And our team treated three patients with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 2012.
It's a form of incurable leukemia that afflicts approximately 20,000 adults every year in the United States.
The first patient that we treated was a retired Marine sergeant and a prison corrections officer.
He had only weeks to live and had, in fact, already paid for his funeral.
The cells were infused, and within days, he had high fevers.
He developed multiple organ failures, was transferred to the ICU and was comatose.
We thought he would die, and, in fact, he was given last rites.
But then, another fork in the road happened.
So, around 28 days after the CAR T cell infusion, he woke up, and the physicians finally examined him, and the cancer was gone.
The big masses that had been there had melted.
Bone marrow biopsies found no evidence of leukemia, and that year, in our first three patients we treated, two of three have had durable remissions now for eight years, and one had a partial remission.
The CAR T cells had attacked the leukemia in these patients and had dissolved between 2.9 and 7.7 pounds of tumor in each patient.
Their bodies had become veritable bioreactors for these CAR T cells, producing millions and millions of CAR T cells in the bone marrow, blood and tumor masses.
And we discovered that these CAR T cells can punch far above their weight class, to use a boxing analogy.
Just one CAR T cell can kill 1,000 tumor cells.
That's right -- it's a ratio of one to a thousand.
The CAR T cell and its daughter progeny cells can divide and divide and divide in the body until the last tumor cell is gone.
There's no precedent for this in cancer medicine.
The first two patients who had full remission remain today leukemia-free, and we think they are cured.
These are people who had run out of options, and by all traditional methods they had, they were like modern-day Lazarus cases.
All I can say is: thank goodness for those forks in the road.
Our next step was to get permission to treat children with acute leukemia, the most common form of cancer in kids.
The first patient we enrolled on the trial was Emily Whitehead, and at that time, she was six years old.
She had gone through a series of chemotherapy and radiation treatments over several years, and her leukemia had always come back.
In fact, it had come back three times.
When we first saw her, Emily was very ill.
Her official diagnosis was advanced, incurable leukemia.
Cancer had invaded her bone marrow, her liver, her spleen.
And when we infused her with the CAR T cells in the spring of April 2012, over the next few days, she did not get better.
She got worse, and in fact, much worse.
As our prison corrections officer had in 2010, she, in 2012, was admitted to the ICU, and this was the scariest fork in the whole road of this story.
By day three, she was comatose and on life support for kidney failure, lung failure and coma.
Her fever was as high as 106 degrees Fahrenheit for three days.
And we didn't know what was causing those fevers.
We did all the standard blood tests for infections, and we could not find an infectious cause for her fever.
But we did find something very unusual in her blood that had never been seen before in medicine.
She had elevated levels of a protein called interleukin-6, or IL-6, in her blood.
It was, in fact, more than a thousandfold above the normal levels.
And here's where yet another fork in the road came in.
By sheer coincidence, one of my daughters has a form of pediatric arthritis.
And as a result, I had been following as a cancer doc, experimental therapies for arthritis for my daughter, in case she would need them.
And it so happened that just months before Emily was admitted to the hospital, a new therapy had been approved by the FDA to treat elevated levels of interleukin-6.
And it was approved for the arthritis that my daughter had.
It's called tocilizumab.
And, in fact, it had just been added to the pharmacy at Emily's hospital, for arthritis.
So when we found Emily had these very high levels of IL-6, I called her doctors in the ICU and said, "Why don't you treat her with this arthritis drug?"
They said I was a cowboy for suggesting that.
And since her fever and low blood pressure had not responded to any other therapy, her doctor quickly asked permission to the institutional review board, her parents, and everybody, of course, said yes.
And they tried it, and the results were nothing short of striking.
Within hours after treatment with tocilizumab, Emily began to improve very rapidly.
Twenty-three days after her treatment, she was declared cancer-free.
And today, she's 12 years old and still in remission.
(Applause) So we now call this violent reaction of the high fevers and coma, following CAR T cells, cytokine release syndrome, or CRS.
We've found that it occurs in nearly all patients who respond to the therapy.
But it does not happen in those patients who fail to respond.
So paradoxically, our patients now hope for these high fevers after therapy, which feels like "the worst flu in their life," when they get CAR T-cell therapies.
They hope for this reaction because they know it's part of the twisting and turning path back to health.
Unfortunately, not every patient recovers.
Patients who do not get CRS are often those who are not cured.
So there's a strong link now between CRS and the ability of the immune system to eradicate leukemia.
That's why last summer, when the FDA approved CAR T cells for leukemia, they also co-approved the use of tocilizumab to block the IL-6 effects and the accompanying CRS in these patients.
That was a very unusual event in medical history.
Emily's doctors have now completed further trials and reported that 27 out of 30 patients, the first 30 we treated, or 90 percent, had a complete remission after CAR T cells, within a month.
A 90 percent complete remission rate in patients with advanced cancer is unheard of in more than 50 years of cancer research.
In fact, companies often declare success in a cancer trial if 15 percent of the patients had a complete response rate.
A remarkable study appeared in the "New England Journal of Medicine" in 2013.
An international study has since confirmed those results.
And that led to the approval by the FDA for pediatric and young adult leukemia in August of 2017.
So as a first-ever approval of a cell and gene therapy, CAR T-cell therapy has also been tested now in adults with refractory lymphoma.
This disease afflicts about 20,000 a year in the United States.
The results were equally impressive and have been durable to date.
And six months ago, the FDA approved the therapy of this advanced lymphoma with CAR T cells.
So now there are many labs and physicians and scientists around the world who have tested CAR T cells across many different diseases, and understandably, we're all thrilled with the rapid pace of advancement.
We're so grateful to see patients who were formerly terminal return to healthy lives, as Emily has.
We're thrilled to see long remissions that may, in fact, be a cure.
At the same time, we're also concerned about the financial cost.
It can cost up to 150,000 dollars to make the CAR T cells for each patient.
And when you add in the cost of treating CRS and other complications, the cost can reach one million dollars per patient.
We must remember that the cost of failure, though, is even worse.
The current noncurative therapies for cancer are also expensive and, in addition, the patient dies.
So, of course, we'd like to see research done now to make this more efficient and increase affordability to all patients.
Fortunately, this is a new and evolving field, and as with many other new therapies and services, prices will come down as industry learns to do things more efficiently.
When I think about all the forks in the road that have led to CAR T-cell therapy, there is one thing that strikes me as very important.
We're reminded that discoveries of this magnitude don't happen overnight.
CAR T-cell therapies came to us after a 30-year journey, along a road full of setbacks and surprises.
In all this world of instant gratification and 24/7, on-demand results, scientists require persistence, vision and patience to rise above all that.
They can see that the fork in the road is not always a dilemma or a detour; sometimes, even though we may not know it at the time, the fork is the way home.
Thank you very much.

It was a normal Tuesday at the superconductor, until a bug in the system created a small situation.
Now your team is trapped in eleven separate pocket dimensions.
Luckily for you, there’s a half-finished experimental teleportation robot that may be able to get you all home, if you can figure out how to work through the quirks of its design.
Over interdimensional radio, your engineers explain that the robot can teleport into the alternate universes you’re trapped in, but it’ll do so completely at random.
The robot has two levers and one big button.
When it appears, you just switch the position of one of the levers from A to B or vice versa, and then the robot will note your dimensional position and teleport to another of the eleven dimensions at random.
If it shows up again, you’ll have to pull a lever before it’ll teleport away.
When anyone presses the button, the robot will bring everyone who pulled a lever back home.
Anyone who didn’t will be lost in the multi-verse forever.
The challenge is to make sure everyone has pulled a lever before anyone hits the button.
While you can talk to each other now over the interdimensional radio and agree on a plan, the robot’s teleportation technology will interfere with all attempts at communication once it arrives.
You won’t be able to attach messages to the robot or scratch notes into its superstrong alloy body.
Your only way to communicate information is to change the position of exactly one lever or hit the button.
What plan will make sure everyone gets home?
Pause the video now if you want to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 It would be nice if you could set different combinations of the levers to indicate who’s already been visited by the robot.
But it has only two levers.
That gives four combinations— far too few to communicate about 11 people, especially when you’re forced to flip one to send the robot onward.
There must be another way.
The critical insight is that not everyone has to know when every pocket dimension has been visited.
If one person accepts responsibility ahead of time for hitting the button, then only they need to know who the robot has visited.
In fact, they don’t even need to know exactly who’s been visited… just how many people have been.
You volunteer to be the person in charge of pressing the button when the moment is right, and give the following directions to everyone else.
Your plan is simple: you’ll use the left lever to count visits, and the right lever will have no meaning, so there’s no harm in moving it up or down.
Each of the others will pull the left lever from position A to position B exactly once.
If the robot appears with the left lever already pulled down, or if an individual has previously pulled the left lever down at any point in the past, then they should move the right lever.
You, meanwhile, will be the only one who ever resets the left lever from position B to position A.
This gives you a way to count how many people have been visited by the robot.
Everyone needs to pull the left lever down exactly once, and you’re the only one to pull it back up.
So you know that the tenth time the robot visits you with its left lever in the down position, it must have visited all ten of the others.
And that means you’re safe to press the button and teleport everyone home.
It may take a while– most likely the robot will need to teleport around 355 times; but better that than leave anyone behind.
Your teammates phase back into your home dimension one at a time.
The mission proves a great success.
Well...mostly.
Noor Inayat Khan was in the midst of a desperate escape.
She had been imprisoned for her activities as an Allied spy, but with the help of a screwdriver and two other prisoners, she was back under the Parisian stars.
As she began to run, her thoughts leapt to the whirlwind of events that had brought her here… Born in Moscow in 1914 to an Indian Muslim father and an American mother, Noor was raised in a profoundly peaceful home.
Her parents were Sufi pacifists, who put their faith in the power of music and compassion.
They moved to Paris, where Noor studied child psychology and published children’s books.
But all this changed with the advent of the Second World War.
In May 1940, with the German army ready to occupy Paris, Noor and her brother were faced with a difficult choice.
As pacifists, they believed that all disputes should be settled non-violently.
But witnessing the devastation across Europe, they decided that standing on the sidelines was not an option.
Traveling to England, Noor volunteered for the Women’s Auxiliary Air Force and trained as a radio operator.
She immersed herself in wireless operations and Morse code– unaware that she was being monitored by a secret organization.
The British Special Operations Executive was established to sabotage the Germans in Nazi-occupied countries.
As a trained radio operator who knew Paris well and spoke fluent French, Noor was an attractive recruit.
In her interview, she was warned that wireless operation was some of the most dangerous work in the intelligence field.
Operators had to lug a conspicuous transmitter through enemy territory, and the clandestine agency couldn’t protect her if she was caught.
Noor accepted her assignment immediately.
While she was determined to take her pacifist principles as far as possible, Noor had to learn the art of espionage.
She learned how to contact intelligence networks, pick a lock, resist interrogation and fire a gun.
In June 1943 she landed in Angers, south of Paris, and made her way to the city armed with a false passport, a pistol and a few French francs.
But her network was compromised.
Within a week of her deployment, all her fellow agents were arrested, and Noor was called home.
She convinced her supervisors to let her stay– which meant doing the work of six radio operators singlehandedly.
Over the following months, she tracked and transported supplies to the French resistance, sent reports of Nazi activity back to London and arranged safe passage for allied soldiers.
This work was essential to building the French resistance and Allied intelligence networks– and, ultimately, ending the war.
Protected only by her quick thinking and charisma, she frequently talked her way out of questioning.
When the Gestapo searched her on the train, she gave them a casual tour of her “film projector.” When an officer spotted her hanging her aerial, she chatted about her passion for listening to music on the radio– and charmed him into helping her set up the cable.
In her entire four month tenure, her sharp wits and stealth never failed her.
But her charm had inspired lethal jealousy.
In October 1943, the sister of a colleague, in love with an agent that loved Noor, sold her address to the Gestapo.
Noor refused to give away any information, focusing instead on her escape.
Secreting a screwdriver away from the guards, they were able to loosen a skylight and slip out into the night.
But just as the prisoners began to run for their lives, an air raid siren alerted her captors.
Noor was caught once again and sent to a German prison.
Then, on to Dachau concentration camp.
Despite being tortured, deprived and isolated, Noor gave nothing away.
In the moments before her execution she is thought to have shouted “Liberté!” Since her heroic sacrifice, Noor has been honoured as a hero who waged secret battles behind enemy lines– paving the way for freedom without ever taking a life.
Twenty years ago, my family introduced a system called "Friday Democracy Meetings."
Every Friday at 7pm, my family came together for an official meeting to discuss the current family affairs.
These meetings were facilitated by one of my parents, and we even had a notetaker.
These meetings had two rules.
First, you are allowed to speak open and freely.
Us kids were allowed to criticize our parents without that being considered disrespectful or rude.
Second rule was the Chatham House rule, meaning whatever is said in the meeting stays in the meeting.
(Laughter) The topics which were discussed in these meetings varied from one week to another.
One week, we'd talk about what food we wanted to eat, what time us kids should go to bed and how to improve things as a family, while another meeting discussed pretty much events that happened at school and how to solve disputes between siblings, by which I mean real fights.
At the end of each meeting, we'd reach decisions and agreements that would last at least until the next meeting.
So you could say I was raised as a politician.
By the age of six or seven, I mastered politics.
I was negotiating, compromising, building alliances with other political actors.
(Laughter) And I even once tried to jeopardize the political process.
(Laughter) These meetings sound very peaceful, civil and democratic, right?
But that was not always the case.
Because of this open, free space to talk, discuss and criticize, things sometimes got really heated.
One meeting went really bad for me.
I was about 10 years old at that time, and I'd done something really horrible at school, which I'm not going to share today -- (Laughter) but my brother decided to bring it up in the meeting.
I could not defend myself, so I decided to withdraw from the meeting and boycott the whole system.
I literally wrote an official letter and handed it to my dad, announcing that I am boycotting.
(Laughter) I thought that if I stopped attending these meetings anymore, the system would collapse, (Laughter) but my family continued with the meetings, and they often made decisions that I disliked.
But I could not challenge these decisions, because I was not attending the meetings, and thus had no right to go against it.
Ironically, when I turned about 13 years old, I ended up attending one of these meetings again, after I boycotted them for a long time.
Because there was an issue that was affecting me only, and no other family member was bringing it up.
The problem was that after each dinner, I was always the only one who was asked to wash the dishes, while my brothers didn't have to do anything about it.
I felt this was unjust, unfair and discriminatory, so I wanted to discuss it in the meeting.
As you know, the idea that it's a woman or a girl's role to do household work is a rule that has been carried out by many societies for so long, so in order for a 13-year-old me to challenge it, I needed a platform.
In the meeting, my brothers argued that none of the other boys we knew were washing the dishes, so why should our family be any different?
But my parents agreed with me and decided that my brothers should assist me.
However, they could not force them, so the problem continued.
Seeing no solution to my problem, I decided to attend another meeting and propose a new system that would be fair to everyone.
So I suggested instead of one person washing all the dishes used by all the family members, each family member should wash their own dishes.
And as a gesture of good faith, I said I'd wash the pots as well.
This way, my brothers could no longer argue that it wasn't within their responsibility as boys or men to wash the dishes and clean after the family, because the system I proposed was about every member of the family cleaning after themselves and taking care of themselves.
Everyone agreed to my proposal, and for years, that was our washing-the-dishes system.
What I just shared with you is a family story, but it's pure politics.
Every part of politics includes decision-making, and ideally, the process of decision-making should include people from different backgrounds, interests, opinions, gender, beliefs, race, ethnicity, age, and so on.
And they should all have an equal opportunity to contribute to the decision-making process and influence the decisions that will affect their lives directly or indirectly.
As such, I find it difficult to understand when I hear young people saying, "I'm too young to engage in politics or to even hold a political opinion."
Similarly, when I hear some women saying, "Politics is a dirty world I don't want to engage with," I'm worried that the idea of politics and political engagement has become so polarized in many parts of the world that ordinary people feel, in order for them to participate in politics, they need to be outspoken activists, and that is not true.
I want to ask these young people, women and ordinary people in general: Can you really afford not to be interested or not to participate in politics?
Politics is not only activism.
It's awareness, it's keeping ourselves informed, it's caring for the facts.
When it's possible, it's casting a vote.
Politics is the tool through which we structure ourselves as groups and societies.
Politics governs every aspect of life, and by not participating in it, you're literally allowing other people to decide on what you can eat, wear, if you can have access to health care, free education, how much tax you pay, when you can retire, what is your pension.
Other people are also deciding on whether your race and ethnicity is enough to consider you a criminal, or if your religion and nationality is enough to put you on a terrorist list.
And if you still think you are a strong, independent human being unaffected by politics, then think twice.
I am speaking to you as a young woman from Libya, a country that is in the middle of a civil war.
After more than 40 years of authoritarian rule, it's not a place where political engagement by women and young people is possible, nor encouraged.
Almost all political dialogues that took place in the past few years, even those gathered by foreign powers, has been with only middle-aged men in the room.
But in places with a broken political system like Libya, or in seemingly functioning places, including international organizations, the systems we have nowadays for political decision-making are not from the people for the people, but they have been established by the few for the few.
And these few have been historically almost exclusively men, and they've produced laws, policies, mechanisms for political participation that are based on the opinions, beliefs, worldviews, dreams, aspirations of this one group of people, while everyone else was kept out.
After all, we've all heard some version of this sentence: "What does a woman, let alone a young person, who is brown, understand about politics?"
When you're young -- and in many parts of the world, a woman -- you often hear experienced politicians say, "But you lack political experience."
And when I hear that, I wonder what sort of experience are they referring to?
The experience of corrupted political systems?
Or of waging wars?
Or are they referring to the experience of putting the interests of economic profits before those of the environment?
Because if this is political experience, then yes -- (Applause) we, as women and young people, have no political experience at all.
Now, politicians might not be the only ones to blame, because ordinary people, and many young people as well, don't care about politics.
And even those who care don't know how to participate.
This must change, and here is my proposal.
We need to teach people at an early age about decision-making and how to be part of it.
Every family is its own mini political system that is usually not democratic, because parents make decisions that affect all members of the family, while the kids have very little to say.
Similarly, politicians make decisions that affect the whole nation, while the people have very little say in them.
We need to change this, and in order to achieve this change systematically, we need to teach people that political, national and global affairs are as relevant to them as personal and family affairs.
So if we want to achieve this, my proposal and advice is, try out the Family Democracy Meeting system.
Because that will enable your kids to exercise their agency and decision-making from a very early age.
Politics is about having conversations, including difficult conversations, that lead to decisions.
And in order to have a conversation, you need to participate, not sign off like I did when I was a kid and then learn the lesson the hard way and have to go back again.
If you include your kids in family conversations, they will grow up and know how to participate in political conversations.
And most importantly, most importantly, they will help others engage.
Thank you.
(Applause)
On the 17th of October, 2009, President Mohamed Nasheed of the Maldives did something unusual.
He held his cabinet meeting underwater.
He literally took his ministers scuba diving, as it were, to warn the world that his country could drown unless we control global warming.
Now I don't know whether he got his message across to the world or not, but he certainly caught mine.
I saw a political stunt.
You see, I'm a politician, and I notice these things.
And let's be honest, the Maldives are distant from where I come from -- my country is Bhutan -- so I didn't lose any sleep over their impending fate.
Barely two months later, I saw another political stunt.
This time, the prime minister of Nepal, he held his cabinet meeting on Mount Everest.
He took all his ministers all the way up to the base camp of Everest to warn the world that the Himalayan glaciers were melting.
Now did that worry me?
You bet it did.
I live in the Himalayas.
But did I lose any sleep over his message?
No.
I wasn't ready to let a political stunt interfere with my beauty sleep.
(Laughter) Now fast-forward 10 years.
In February this year, I saw this report.
This here report basically concludes that one-third of the ice on the Hindu Kush Himalaya mountains could melt by the end of the century.
But that's only if, if we are able to contain global warming to 1.5 degrees centigrade over preindustrial levels.
Otherwise, if we can't, the glaciers would melt much faster.
1.5 degrees Celsius. "No way," I thought.
Even the Paris Agreement's ambitious targets aimed to limit global warming to two degrees centigrade.
1.5 degrees centigrade is what they call the best-case scenario.
"Now this can't be true," I thought.
The Hindu Kush Himalaya region is the world's third-largest repository of ice, after the North and South Poles.
That's why we are also called the "Third Pole."
There's a lot of ice in the region.
And yes, the glaciers, they are melting.
We know that.
I have been to those in my country.
I've seen them, and yes, they are melting.
They are vulnerable.
"But they can't be that vulnerable," I remember thinking.
But what if they are?
What if our glaciers melt much more quickly than I anticipate?
What if our glaciers are much more vulnerable than previously thought?
And what if, as a result, the glacial lakes -- now these are lakes that form when glaciers melt -- what if those lakes burst under the weight of additional water?
And what if those floods cascade into other glacial lakes, creating even bigger outbursts?
That would create unprecedented flash floods in my country.
That would wreck my country.
That would wreak havoc in my country.
That would have the potential to literally destroy our land, our livelihood, our way of life.
So that report caught my attention in ways that political stunts couldn't.
It was put together by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, or ICIMOD, which is based in Nepal.
Scientists and experts have studied our glaciers for decades, and their report kept me awake at night, agonizing about the bad news and what it meant for my country and my people.
So after several sleepless nights, I went to Nepal to visit ICIMOD.
I found a team of highly competent and dedicated scientists there, and here's what they told me.
Number one: the Hindu Kush Himalaya glaciers have been melting for some time now.
Take that glacier, for instance.
It's on Mount Everest.
As you can see, this once massive glacier has already lost much of its ice.
Number two: the glaciers are now melting much more quickly -- so quickly, in fact, that at just 1.5 degrees centigrade of global warming, one-third of the glaciers would melt.
At two degrees centigrade of global warming, half the glaciers would disappear.
And if current trends were to continue, a full two-thirds of our glaciers would vanish.
Number three: global warming means that our mountains receive more rain and less snow ...
and, unlike snowfall, rain melts ice, which just hurts the health of our glaciers.
Number four: pollution in the region has increased the amount of black carbon that's deposited on our glaciers.
Black carbon is like soot.
Black carbon absorbs heat and just accelerates the melting of glaciers.
To summarize, our glaciers are melting rapidly, and global warming is making them melt much more quickly.
But what does this mean?
It means that the 240 million people who live in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region -- in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, China, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar and my own beloved country, Bhutan -- these people will be directly affected.
When glaciers melt, when there's more rain and less snow, there will be huge changes in the way water behaves.
There will be more extremes: more intense rain, more flash floods, more landslides, more glacial lake outburst floods.
All this will cause unimaginable destruction in a region that already has some of the poorest people on earth.
But it's not just the people in the immediate region who'll be affected.
People living downstream will also be hit hard.
That's because 10 of their major rivers originate in the Hindu Kush Himalaya mountains.
These rivers provide critical water for agriculture and drinking water to more than 1.6 billion people living downstream.
That's one in five humans.
That's why the Hindu Kush Himalaya mountains are also called the "water towers of Asia."
But when glaciers melt, when monsoons turn severe, those rivers will obviously flood, so there will be deluges when water is not required and droughts will be very common, when water is desperately required.
In short, Asia's water tower will be broken, and that will be disastrous for one-fifth of humanity.
Should the rest of the world care?
Should you, for instance, care?
Remember, I didn't care when I heard that the Maldives could disappear underwater.
And that is the crux of the problem, isn't it?
We don't care.
We don't care until we are personally affected.
I mean, we know. We know climate change is real.
We know that we face drastic and dramatic change.
We know that it is coming fast.
Yet most of us act as if everything were normal.
So we must care, all of us, and if you can't care for those who are affected by the melting of glaciers, you should at least care for yourself.
That's because the Hindu Kush Himalaya mountains -- the entire region is like the pulse of the planet.
If the region falls sick, the entire planet will eventually suffer.
And right now, with our glaciers melting rapidly, the region is not just sick -- it is crying out for help.
And how will it affect the rest of the world?
One obvious scenario is the potential destabilization caused by tens of millions of climate refugees, who'll be forced to move because they have no or little water, or because their livelihoods have been destroyed by the melting of glaciers.
Another scenario we can't take lightly is the potential of conflict over water and the political destabilization in a region that has three nuclear powers: China, India, Pakistan.
I believe that the situation in our region is grave enough to warrant the creation of a new intergovernmental agency.
So as a native from that part of the world, I want to propose here, today, the establishment of the Third Pole Council, a high-level, intergovernmental organization tasked with the singular responsibility of protecting the world's third-largest repository of ice.
A Third Pole Council would consist of all eight countries located in the region as member countries, as equal member countries, and could also include representative organizations and other countries who have vested interests in the region as non-voting members.
But the big idea is to get all stakeholders together to work together.
To work together to monitor the health of the glaciers; to work together to shape and implement policies to protect our glaciers, and, by extension, to protect the billions of people who depend on our glaciers.
We have to work together, because thinking globally, acting locally ...
does not work.
We've tried that in Bhutan.
We've made immense sacrifices to act locally ...
and while individual localized efforts will continue to be important, they cannot stand up to the onslaught of climate change.
To stand up to climate change, we must work together.
We must think globally and act regionally.
Our entire region must come together, to work together, to fight climate change together, to make our voices heard together.
And that includes India and China.
They must step up their game.
They must take the ownership of the fight to protect our glaciers.
And for that, these two countries, these two powerful giants, must reduce their own greenhouse gases, control their pollution, and lead the fight.
Lead the global fight against climate change.
And all that with a renewed sense of urgency.
Only then -- and that, too, only maybe -- will our region and other regions that depend on our glaciers have any chance to avoid major catastrophes.
Time is running out.
We must act together, now.
Otherwise, the next time Nepal's cabinet meets on Mount Everest, that spectacular backdrop ...
may look quite different.
And if that happens, if our glaciers melt, rising sea levels could well drown the Maldives.
And while they can hold their cabinet meetings underwater to send an SOS to the world, their country can keep existing only if their islands keep existing.
The Maldives are still distant, away.
Their islands are distant from where I live.
But now, I pay close attention to what happens out there.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Do you feel trapped in a broken economic model?
A model that's trashing the living world and threatens the lives of our descendants?
A model that excludes billions of people while making a handful unimaginably rich?
That sorts us into winners and losers, and then blames the losers for their misfortune?
Welcome to neoliberalism, the zombie doctrine that never seems to die, however comprehensively it is discredited.
Now you might have imagined that the financial crisis of 2008 would have led to the collapse of neoliberalism.
After all, it exposed its central features, which were deregulating business and finance, tearing down public protections, throwing us into extreme competition with each other, as, well, just a little bit flawed.
And intellectually, it did collapse.
But still, it dominates our lives.
Why?
Well, I believe the answer is that we have not yet produced a new story with which to replace it.
Stories are the means by which we navigate the world.
They allow us to interpret its complex and contradictory signals.
When we want to make sense of something, the sense we seek is not scientific sense but narrative fidelity.
Does what we are hearing reflect the way that we expect humans and the world to behave?
Does it hang together?
Does it progress as a story should progress?
Now, we are creatures of narrative, and a string of facts and figures, however important facts and figures are -- and, you know, I'm an empiricist, I believe in facts and figures -- but those facts and figures have no power to displace a persuasive story.
The only thing that can replace a story is a story.
You cannot take away someone's story without giving them a new one.
And it's not just stories in general that we are attuned to, but particular narrative structures.
There are a number of basic plots that we use again and again, and in politics there is one basic plot which turns out to be tremendously powerful, and I call this "the restoration story."
It goes as follows.
Disorder afflicts the land, caused by powerful and nefarious forces working against the interests of humanity.
But the hero will revolt against this disorder, fight those powerful forces, against the odds overthrow them and restore harmony to the land.
You've heard this story before.
It's the Bible story.
It's the "Harry Potter" story.
It's the "Lord of the Rings" story.
It's the "Narnia" story.
But it's also the story that has accompanied almost every political and religious transformation going back millennia.
In fact, we could go as far as to say that without a powerful new restoration story, a political and religious transformation might not be able to happen.
It's that important.
After laissez-faire economics triggered the Great Depression, John Maynard Keynes sat down to write a new economics, and what he did was to tell a restoration story, and it went something like this.
Disorder afflicts the land!
(Laughter) Caused by the powerful and nefarious forces of the economic elite, which have captured the world's wealth.
But the hero of the story, the enabling state, supported by working class and middle class people, will contest that disorder, will fight those powerful forces by redistributing wealth, and through spending public money on public goods will generate income and jobs, restoring harmony to the land.
Now like all good restoration stories, this one resonated across the political spectrum.
Democrats and Republicans, labor and conservatives, left and right all became, broadly, Keynesian.
Then, when Keynesianism ran into trouble in the 1970s, the neoliberals, people like Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, came forward with their new restoration story, and it went something like this.
You'll never guess what's coming.
(Laughter) Disorder afflicts the land!
Caused by the powerful and nefarious forces of the overmighty state, whose collectivizing tendencies crush freedom and individualism and opportunity.
But the hero of the story, the entrepreneur, will fight those powerful forces, roll back the state, and through creating wealth and opportunity, restore harmony to the land.
And that story also resonated across the political spectrum.
Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and labor, they all became, broadly, neoliberal.
Opposite stories with an identical narrative structure.
Then, in 2008, the neoliberal story fell apart, and its opponents came forward with ...
nothing.
No new restoration story!
The best they had to offer was a watered-down neoliberalism or a microwaved Keynesianism.
And that is why we're stuck.
Without that new story, we are stuck with the old failed story that keeps on failing.
Despair is the state we fall into when our imagination fails.
When we have no story that explains the present and describes the future, hope evaporates.
Political failure is at heart a failure of imagination.
Without a restoration story that can tell us where we need to go, nothing is going to change, but with such a restoration story, almost everything can change.
The story we need to tell is a story which will appeal to as wide a range of people as possible, crossing political fault lines.
It should resonate with deep needs and desires.
It should be simple and intelligible, and it should be grounded in reality.
Now, I admit that all of this sounds like a bit of a tall order.
But I believe that in Western nations, there is actually a story like this waiting to be told.
Over the past few years, there's been a fascinating convergence of findings in several different sciences, in psychology and anthropology and neuroscience and evolutionary biology, and they all tell us something pretty amazing: that human beings have got this massive capacity for altruism.
Sure, we all have a bit of selfishness and greed inside us, but in most people, those are not our dominant values.
And we also turn out to be the supreme cooperators.
We survived the African savannas, despite being weaker and slower than our predators and most of our prey, by an amazing ability to engage in mutual aid, and that urge to cooperate has been hardwired into our minds through natural selection.
These are the central, crucial facts about humankind: our amazing altruism and cooperation.
But something has gone horribly wrong.
Disorder afflicts the land.
(Laughter) Our good nature has been thwarted by several forces, but I think the most powerful of them is the dominant political narrative of our times, which tells us that we should live in extreme individualism and competition with each other.
It pushes us to fight each other, to fear and mistrust each other.
It atomizes society.
It weakens the social bonds that make our lives worth living.
And into that vacuum grow these violent, intolerant forces.
We are a society of altruists, but we are governed by psychopaths.
(Applause) But it doesn't have to be like this.
It really doesn't, because we have this incredible capacity for togetherness and belonging, and by invoking that capacity, we can recover those amazing components of our humanity: our altruism and cooperation.
Where there is atomization, we can build a thriving civic life with a rich participatory culture.
Where we find ourselves crushed between market and state, we can build an economics that respects both people and planet.
And we can create this economics around that great neglected sphere, the commons.
The commons is neither market nor state, capitalism nor communism, but it consists of three main elements: a particular resource; a particular community that manages that resource; and the rules and negotiations the community develops to manage it.
Think of community broadband or community energy cooperatives or the shared land for growing fruit and vegetables that in Britain we call allotments.
A common can't be sold, it can't be given away, and its benefits are shared equally among the members of the community.
Where we have been ignored and exploited, we can revive our politics.
We can recover democracy from the people who have captured it.
We can use new rules and methods of elections to ensure that financial power never trumps democratic power again.
(Applause) Representative democracy should be tempered by participatory democracy so that we can refine our political choices, and that choice should be exercised as much as possible at the local level.
If something can be decided locally, it shouldn't be determined nationally.
And I call all this the politics of belonging.
Now, I think this has got the potential to appeal across quite a wide range of people, and the reason for this is that among the very few values that both left and right share are belonging and community.
And we might mean slightly different things by them, but at least we start with some language in common.
In fact, you can see a lot of politics as being a search for belonging.
Even fascists seek community, albeit a frighteningly homogenous community where everyone looks the same and wears the same uniform and chants the same slogans.
What we need to create is a community based on bridging networks, not bonding networks.
Now a bonding network brings together people from a homogenous group, whereas a bridging network brings together people from different groups.
And my belief is that if we create sufficiently rich and vibrant bridging communities, we can thwart the urge for people to burrow into the security of a homogenous bonding community defending themselves against the other.
So in summary, our new story could go something like this.
Disorder afflicts the land!
(Laughter) Caused by the powerful and nefarious forces of people who say there's no such thing as society, who tell us that our highest purpose in life is to fight like stray dogs over a dustbin.
But the heroes of the story, us, we'll revolt against this disorder.
We will fight those nefarious forces by building rich, engaging, inclusive and generous communities, and, in doing so, we will restore harmony to the land.
(Applause) Now whether or not you feel this is the right story, I hope you'll agree that we need one.
We need a new restoration story, which is going to guide us out of the mess we're in, which tells us why we're in the mess and tells us how to get out of that mess.
And that story, if we tell it right, will infect the minds of people across the political spectrum.
Our task is to tell the story that lights the path to a better world.
Thank you.
(Applause)
In the city of Alexandria in 415 CE, the bishop and the governor were in a fight.
It started with a disagreement over the behavior of a militia of monks, and ended with an accusation of witchcraft leveled against one of the most powerful figures in the city.
Hypatia of Alexandria was a prominent mathematician, philosopher, and advisor to the city’s leaders.
In the centuries since she lived, the details of her life have been the subject of much dispute and have taken on an almost mythical status.
But while none of Hypatia’s own writings survive, her contemporaries’ and students’ accounts of her work and life paint a picture of the qualities that made her renowned as a scholar, beloved as a teacher, and ultimately led to her downfall.
Hypatia was born around 355 in Alexandria, then part of the Egyptian province of the Eastern Roman Empire, and an intellectual center.
Her father Theon was an accomplished Greek mathematician and astronomer; her mother is unknown.
Hypatia was likely an only child, and Theon educated her himself.
By adulthood, she had surpassed her father in both mathematics and philosophy, becoming the city’s foremost scholar and taking over his position at the head of the Platonic school, similar to a modern university.
She refined scientific instruments, wrote math textbooks, and developed a more efficient method of long division.
But perhaps her most significant contributions to intellectual life in Alexandria came through her teaching.
The philosophy Hypatia taught drew from the legacy of Plato and Aristotle, as well as the mystical philosopher Plotinus and the mathematician Pythagoras.
The convergence of these influences merged to form a school called Neoplatonism.
For the Neoplatonists, mathematics had a spiritual aspect, divided among the four branches of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music.
These subjects were not studied merely for the sake of curiosity or practical utility, but because they authenticated the belief that numbers were the sacred language of the universe.
In the repeated patterns of algebraic formulas and geometric shapes, the orbits of the planets, and the harmonious intervals of musical tones, the Neoplatonists saw a rational cosmic force at work.
Students delved into this ordered mathematical world to achieve higher unity with this force, known as “the One.” While Hypatia was considered pagan— a term for traditional Roman belief before Christianity— she worshipped no particular deity or deities, and her ideas could be applied alongside multiple religious viewpoints.
Jewish and Christian as well as pagan students travelled from the farthest reaches of the empire to study with her.
The nonpartisan environment Hypatia fostered, where all students could feel comfortable, was especially remarkable given the religious and political turmoil that was fracturing the city of Alexandria at the time.
Christianity had recently become the Empire’s state religion.
The local archbishop Cyril had steadily gained political power, commanding zealous militias of Christian monks to destroy pagan temples and harass the Jewish population.
In doing so, he encroached on the secular authority of the Roman governor Orestes, himself a moderate Christian, leading to a bitter public feud between the two men.
Because she was seen as a wise and impartial figure, governor Orestes consulted Hypatia, who advised him to act with fairness and restraint.
But when a group of Cyril’s monks incited a riot, badly injuring Orestes in the process, he had their leader tortured to death.
Cyril and his followers blamed Hypatia, accusing her of witchcraft to turn Orestes against Christianity.
In March 415, as Hypatia was traveling through the city, the bishop’s militia of monks dragged her from her carriage and brutally murdered and dismembered her.
Hypatia’s death was a turning point in the politics of Alexandria.
In the wake of her murder, other philosophers in the Greek and Roman tradition fled, and the city’s role as a center of learning declined.
In a very real way, the spirit of inquisition, openness, and fairness she fostered died with her.
Just over a mile away from here, in Edinburgh's Old Town, is Panmure House.
Panmure House was the home of the world-renowned Scottish economist Adam Smith.
In his important work "The Wealth of Nations," Adam Smith argued, amongst many other things, that the measurement of a country's wealth was not just its gold and silver reserves.
It was the totality of the country's production and commerce.
I guess it was one of the earliest descriptions of what we now know today as gross domestic product, GDP.
Now, in the years since, of course, that measurement of production and commerce, GDP, has become ever more important, to the point that today -- and I don't believe this is what Adam Smith would have intended -- that it is often seen as the most important measurement of a country's overall success.
And my argument today is that it is time for that to change.
You know, what we choose to measure as a country matters.
It really matters, because it drives political focus, it drives public activity.
And against that context, I think the limitations of GDP as a measurement of a country's success are all too obvious.
You know, GDP measures the output of all of our work, but it says nothing about the nature of that work, about whether that work is worthwhile or fulfilling.
It puts a value, for example, on illegal drug consumption, but not on unpaid care.
It values activity in the short term that boosts the economy, even if that activity is hugely damaging to the sustainability of our planet in the longer term.
And we reflect on the past decade of political and economic upheaval, of growing inequalities, and when we look ahead to the challenges of the climate emergency, increasing automation, an aging population, then I think the argument for the case for a much broader definition of what it means to be successful as a country, as a society, is compelling, and increasingly so.
And that is why Scotland, in 2018, took the lead, took the initiative in establishing a new network called the Wellbeing Economy Governments group, bringing together as founding members the countries of Scotland, Iceland and New Zealand, for obvious reasons.
We're sometimes called the SIN countries, although our focus is very much on the common good.
And the purpose of this group is to challenge that focus on the narrow measurement of GDP.
To say that, yes, economic growth matters -- it is important -- but it is not all that is important.
And growth in GDP should not be pursued at any or all cost.
In fact, the argument of that group is that the goal, the objective of economic policy should be collective well-being: how happy and healthy a population is, not just how wealthy a population is.
And I'll touch on the policy implications of that in a moment.
But I think, particularly in the world we live in today, it has a deeper resonance.
You know, when we focus on well-being, we start a conversation that provokes profound and fundamental questions.
What really matters to us in our lives?
What do we value in the communities we live in?
What kind of country, what kind of society, do we really want to be?
And when we engage people in those questions, in finding the answers to those questions, then I believe that we have a much better chance of addressing the alienation and disaffection from politics that is so prevalent in so many countries across the developed world today.
In policy terms, this journey for Scotland started back in 2007, when we published what we call our National Performance Framework, looking at the range of indicators that we measure ourselves against.
And those indicators are as varied as income inequality, the happiness of children, access to green spaces, access to housing.
None of these are captured in GDP statistics, but they are all fundamental to a healthy and a happy society.
(Applause) And that broader approach is at the heart of our economic strategy, where we give equal importance to tackling inequality as we do to economic competitiveness.
It drives our commitment to fair work, making sure that work is fulfilling and well-paid.
It's behind our decision to establish a Just Transition Commission to guide our path to a carbon zero economy.
We know from economic transformations of the past that if we're not careful, there are more losers than winners.
And as we face up to the challenges of climate change and automation, we must not make those mistakes again.
The work we're doing here in Scotland is, I think, significant, but we have much, much to learn from other countries.
I mentioned, a moment ago, our partner nations in the Wellbeing network: Iceland and New Zealand.
It's worth noting, and I'll leave it to you to decide whether this is relevant or not, that all three of these countries are currently led by women.
(Applause) They, too, are doing great work.
New Zealand, in 2019, publishing its first Wellbeing Budget, with mental health at its heart; Iceland leading the way on equal pay, childcare and paternity rights -- not policies that we immediately think of when we talk about creating a wealthy economy, but policies that are fundamental to a healthy economy and a happy society.
I started with Adam Smith and "The Wealth of Nations."
In Adam Smith's earlier work, "The Theory of Moral Sentiments," which I think is just as important, he made the observation that the value of any government is judged in proportion to the extent that it makes its people happy.
I think that is a good founding principle for any group of countries focused on promoting well-being.
None of us have all of the answers, not even Scotland, the birthplace of Adam Smith.
But in the world we live in today, with growing divides and inequalities, with disaffection and alienation, it is more important than ever that we ask and find the answers to those questions and promote a vision of society that has well-being, not just wealth, at its very heart.
(Applause) You are right now in the beautiful, sunny capital city ...
(Laughter) of the country that led the world in the Enlightenment, the country that helped lead the world into the industrial age, the country that right now is helping to lead the world into the low carbon age.
I want, and I'm determined, that Scotland will also be the country that helps change the focus of countries and governments across the world to put well-being at the heart of everything that we do.
I think we owe that to this generation.
I certainly believe we owe that to the next generation and all those that come after us.
And if we do that, led here from the country of the Enlightenment, then I think we create a better, healthier, fairer and happier society here at home.
And we play our part in Scotland in building a fairer, happier world as well.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Recently, the leadership team of an American supermarket chain decided that their business needed to get a lot more efficient.
So they embraced their digital transformation with zeal.
Out went the teams supervising meat, veg, bakery, and in came an algorithmic task allocator.
Now, instead of people working together, each employee went, clocked in, got assigned a task, did it, came back for more.
This was scientific management on steroids, standardizing and allocating work.
It was super efficient.
Well, not quite, because the task allocator didn't know when a customer was going to drop a box of eggs, couldn't predict when some crazy kid was going to knock over a display, or when the local high school decided that everybody needed to bring in coconuts the next day.
(Laughter) Efficiency works really well when you can predict exactly what you're going to need.
But when the anomalous or unexpected comes along -- kids, customers, coconuts -- well, then efficiency is no longer your friend.
This has become a really crucial issue, this ability to deal with the unexpected, because the unexpected is becoming the norm.
It's why experts and forecasters are reluctant to predict anything more than 400 days out.
Why?
Because over the last 20 or 30 years, much of the world has gone from being complicated to being complex -- which means that yes, there are patterns, but they don't repeat themselves regularly.
It means that very small changes can make a disproportionate impact.
And it means that expertise won't always suffice, because the system just keeps changing too fast.
So what that means is that there's a huge amount in the world that kind of defies forecasting now.
It's why the Bank of England will say yes, there will be another crash, but we don't know why or when.
We know that climate change is real, but we can't predict where forest fires will break out, and we don't know which factories are going to flood.
It's why companies are blindsided when plastic straws and bags and bottled water go from staples to rejects overnight, and baffled when a change in social mores turns stars into pariahs and colleagues into outcasts: ineradicable uncertainty.
In an environment that defies so much forecasting, efficiency won't just not help us, it specifically undermines and erodes our capacity to adapt and respond.
So if efficiency is no longer our guiding principle, how should we address the future?
What kind of thinking is really going to help us?
What sort of talents must we be sure to defend?
I think that, where in the past we used to think a lot about just in time management, now we have to start thinking about just in case, preparing for events that are generally certain but specifically remain ambiguous.
One example of this is the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness, CEPI.
We know there will be more epidemics in future, but we don't know where or when or what.
So we can't plan.
But we can prepare.
So CEPI's developing multiple vaccines for multiple diseases, knowing that they can't predict which vaccines are going to work or which diseases will break out.
So some of those vaccines will never be used.
That's inefficient.
But it's robust, because it provides more options, and it means that we don't depend on a single technological solution.
Epidemic responsiveness also depends hugely on people who know and trust each other.
But those relationships take time to develop, time that is always in short supply when an epidemic breaks out.
So CEPI is developing relationships, friendships, alliances now knowing that some of those may never be used.
That's inefficient, a waste of time, perhaps, but it's robust.
You can see robust thinking in financial services, too.
In the past, banks used to hold much less capital than they're required to today, because holding so little capital, being too efficient with it, is what made the banks so fragile in the first place.
Now, holding more capital looks and is inefficient.
But it's robust, because it protects the financial system against surprises.
Countries that are really serious about climate change know that they have to adopt multiple solutions, multiple forms of renewable energy, not just one.
The countries that are most advanced have been working for years now, changing their water and food supply and healthcare systems, because they recognize that by the time they have certain prediction, that information may very well come too late.
You can take the same approach to trade wars, and many countries do.
Instead of depending on a single huge trading partner, they try to be everybody's friends, because they know they can't predict which markets might suddenly become unstable.
It's time-consuming and expensive, negotiating all these deals, but it's robust because it makes their whole economy better defended against shocks.
It's particularly a strategy adopted by small countries that know they'll never have the market muscle to call the shots, so it's just better to have too many friends.
But if you're stuck in one of these organizations that's still kind of captured by the efficiency myth, how do you start to change it?
Try some experiments.
In the Netherlands, home care nursing used to be run pretty much like the supermarket: standardized and prescribed work to the minute: nine minutes on Monday, seven minutes on Wednesday, eight minutes on Friday.
The nurses hated it.
So one of them, Jos de Blok, proposed an experiment.
Since every patient is different, and we don't quite know exactly what they'll need, why don't we just leave it to the nurses to decide?
Sound reckless?
(Laughter) (Applause) In his experiment, Jos found the patients got better in half the time, and costs fell by 30 percent.
When I asked Jos what had surprised him about his experiment, he just kind of laughed and he said, "Well, I had no idea it could be so easy to find such a huge improvement, because this isn't the kind of thing you can know or predict sitting at a desk or staring at a computer screen."
So now this form of nursing has proliferated across the Netherlands and around the world.
But in every new country it still starts with experiments, because each place is slightly and unpredictably different.
Of course, not all experiments work.
Jos tried a similar approach to the fire service and found it didn't work because the service is just too centralized.
Failed experiments look inefficient, but they're often the only way you can figure out how the real world works.
So now he's trying teachers.
Experiments like that require creativity and not a little bravery.
In England -- I was about to say in the UK, but in England -- (Laughter) (Applause) In England, the leading rugby team, or one of the leading rugby teams, is Saracens.
The manager and the coach there realized that all the physical training they do and the data-driven conditioning that they do has become generic; really, all the teams do exactly the same thing.
So they risked an experiment.
They took the whole team away, even in match season, on ski trips and to look at social projects in Chicago.
This was expensive, it was time-consuming, and it could be a little risky putting a whole bunch of rugby players on a ski slope, right?
(Laughter) But what they found was that the players came back with renewed bonds of loyalty and solidarity.
And now when they're on the pitch under incredible pressure, they manifest what the manager calls "poise" -- an unflinching, unwavering dedication to each other.
Their opponents are in awe of this, but still too in thrall to efficiency to try it.
At a London tech company, Verve, the CEO measures just about everything that moves, but she couldn't find anything that made any difference to the company's productivity.
So she devised an experiment that she calls "Love Week": a whole week where each employee has to look for really clever, helpful, imaginative things that a counterpart does, call it out and celebrate it.
It takes a huge amount of time and effort; lots of people would call it distracting.
But it really energizes the business and makes the whole company more productive.
Preparedness, coalition-building, imagination, experiments, bravery -- in an unpredictable age, these are tremendous sources of resilience and strength.
They aren't efficient, but they give us limitless capacity for adaptation, variation and invention.
And the less we know about the future, the more we're going to need these tremendous sources of human, messy, unpredictable skills.
But in our growing dependence on technology, we're asset-stripping those skills.
Every time we use technology to nudge us through a decision or a choice or to interpret how somebody's feeling or to guide us through a conversation, we outsource to a machine what we could, can do ourselves, and it's an expensive trade-off.
The more we let machines think for us, the less we can think for ourselves.
The more -- (Applause) The more time doctors spend staring at digital medical records, the less time they spend looking at their patients.
The more we use parenting apps, the less we know our kids.
The more time we spend with people that we're predicted and programmed to like, the less we can connect with people who are different from ourselves.
And the less compassion we need, the less compassion we have.
What all of these technologies attempt to do is to force-fit a standardized model of a predictable reality onto a world that is infinitely surprising.
What gets left out?
Anything that can't be measured -- which is just about everything that counts.
(Applause) Our growing dependence on technology risks us becoming less skilled, more vulnerable to the deep and growing complexity of the real world.
Now, as I was thinking about the extremes of stress and turbulence that we know we will have to confront, I went and I talked to a number of chief executives whose own businesses had gone through existential crises, when they teetered on the brink of collapse.
These were frank, gut-wrenching conversations.
Many men wept just remembering.
So I asked them: "What kept you going through this?"
And they all had exactly the same answer.
"It wasn't data or technology," they said.
"It was my friends and my colleagues who kept me going."
One added, "It was pretty much the opposite of the gig economy."
But then I went and I talked to a group of young, rising executives, and I asked them, "Who are your friends at work?"
And they just looked blank.
"There's no time."
"They're too busy."
"It's not efficient."
Who, I wondered, is going to give them imagination and stamina and bravery when the storms come?
Anyone who tries to tell you that they know the future is just trying to own it, a spurious kind of manifest destiny.
The harder, deeper truth is that the future is uncharted, that we can't map it till we get there.
But that's OK, because we have so much imagination -- if we use it.
We have deep talents of inventiveness and exploration -- if we apply them.
We are brave enough to invent things we've never seen before.
Lose those skills, and we are adrift.
But hone and develop them, we can make any future we choose.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Every other night in Japan, I step out of my apartment, I climb up a hill for 15 minutes, and then I head into my local health club, where three ping-pong tables are set up in a studio.
And space is limited, so at every table, one pair of players practices forehands, another practices backhands, and every now and then, the balls collide in midair and everybody says, "Wow!"
Then, choosing lots, we select partners and play doubles.
But I honestly couldn't tell you who's won, because we change partners every five minutes.
And everybody is trying really hard to win points, but nobody is keeping track of who is winning games.
And after an hour or so of furious exertion, I can honestly tell you that not knowing who has won feels like the ultimate victory.
In Japan, it's been said, they've created a competitive spirit without competition.
Now, all of you know that geopolitics is best followed by watching ping-pong.
(Laughter) The two strongest powers in the world were fiercest enemies until, in 1972, an American ping-pong team was allowed to visit Communist China.
And as soon as the former adversaries were gathered around some small green tables, each of them could claim a victory, and the whole world could breathe more easily.
China's leader, Mao Zedong, wrote a whole manual on ping-pong, and he called the sport "a spiritual nuclear weapon."
And it's been said that the only honorary lifelong member of the US Table Tennis Association is the then-President Richard Nixon, who helped to engineer this win-win situation through ping-pong diplomacy.
But long before that, really, the history of the modern world was best told through the bouncing white ball.
"Ping-pong" sounds like a cousin of "sing-song," like something Eastern, but actually, it's believed that it was invented by high-class Brits during Victorian times, who started hitting wine corks over walls of books after dinner.
(Laughter) No exaggeration.
(Laughter) And by the end of World War I, the sport was dominated by players from the former Austro-Hungarian Empire: eight out of nine early world championships were claimed by Hungary.
And Eastern Europeans grew so adept at hitting back everything that was hit at them that they almost brought the whole sport to a standstill.
In one championship match in Prague in 1936, the first point is said to have lasted two hours and 12 minutes.
The first point!
Longer than a "Mad Max" movie.
And according to one of the players, the umpire had to retire with a sore neck before the point was concluded.
(Laughter) That player started hitting the ball back with his left hand and dictating chess moves between shots.
(Laughter) Many in the audience started, of course, filing out, as that single point lasted maybe 12,000 strokes.
And an emergency meeting of the International Table Tennis Association had to be held then and there, and soon the rules were changed so that no game could last longer than 20 minutes.
(Laughter) Sixteen years later, Japan entered the picture, when a little-known watchmaker called Hiroji Satoh showed up at the world championships in Bombay in 1952.
And Satoh was not very big, he wasn't highly rated, he was wearing spectacles, but he was armed with a paddle that was not pimpled, as other paddles were, but covered by a thick spongy rubber foam.
And thanks to this silencing secret weapon, the little-known Satoh won a gold medal.
One million people came out into the streets of Tokyo to greet him upon his return, and really, Japan's postwar resurgence was set into motion.
What I learned, though, at my regular games in Japan, is more what could be called the inner sport of global domination, sometimes known as life.
We never play singles in our club, only doubles, and because, as I say, we change partners every five minutes, if you do happen to lose, you're very likely to win six minutes later.
We also play best-of-two sets, so often, there's no loser at all.
Ping-pong diplomacy.
And I always remember that as a boy growing up in England, I was taught that the point of a game was to win.
But in Japan, I'm encouraged to believe that, really, the point of a game is to make as many people as possible around you feel that they are winners.
So you're not careening up and down as an individual might, but you're part of a regular, steady chorus.
The most skillful players in our club deploy their skills to turn a 9-1 lead for their team into a 9-9 game in which everybody is intensely involved.
And my friend who hits these high, looping lobs that smaller players flail at and miss -- well, he wins a lot of points, but I think he's thought of as a loser.
In Japan, a game of ping-pong is really like an act of love.
You're learning how to play with somebody, rather than against her.
And I'll confess, at first, this seemed to me to take all the fun out of the sport.
I couldn't exult after a tremendous upset victory against our strongest players, because six minutes later, with a new partner, I was falling behind again.
On the other hand, I never felt disconsolate.
And when I flew away from Japan and started playing singles again with my English archrival, I noticed that after every defeat, I was really brokenhearted.
But after every victory, I couldn't sleep either, because I knew there was only one way to go, and that was down.
Now, if I were trying to do business in Japan, this would lead to endless frustration.
In Japan, unlike elsewhere, if the score is still level after four hours, a baseball game ends in a tie, and because the league standings are based on winning percentage, a team with quite a few ties can finish ahead of a team with more victories.
One of the first times an American was ever brought over to Japan to lead a professional Japanese baseball team, Bobby Valentine, in 1995, he took this really mediocre squad, he lead them to a stunning second-place finish, and he was instantly fired.
Why?
"Well," said the team spokesman, "because of his emphasis on winning."
(Laughter) Official Japan can feel quite a lot like that point that was said to last two hours and 12 minutes, and playing not to lose can take all the imagination, the daring, the excitement, out of things.
At the same time, playing ping-pong in Japan reminds me why choirs regularly enjoy more fun than soloists.
In a choir, your only job is to play your small part perfectly, to hit your notes with feeling, and by so doing, to help to create a beautiful harmony that's much greater than the sum of its parts.
Yes, every choir does need a conductor, but I think a choir releases you from a child's simple sense of either-ors.
You come to see that the opposite of winning isn't losing -- it's failing to see the larger picture.
As my life goes on, I'm really startled to see that no event can properly be assessed for years after it has unfolded.
I once lost everything I owned in the world, every last thing, in a wildfire.
But in time, I came to see that it was that seeming loss that allowed me to live on the earth more gently, to write without notes, and actually, to move to Japan and the inner health club known as the ping-pong table.
Conversely, I once stumbled into the perfect job, and I came to see that seeming happiness can stand in the way of true joy even more than misery does.
Playing doubles in Japan really relieves me of all my anxiety, and at the end of an evening, I notice everybody is filing out in a more or less equal state of delight.
I'm reminded every night that not getting ahead isn't the same thing as falling behind any more than not being lively is the same thing as being dead.
And I've come to understand why it is that Chinese universities are said to offer degrees in ping-pong, and why researchers have found that ping-pong can actually help a little with mild mental disorders and even autism.
But as I watch the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, I'm going to be keenly aware that it won't be possible to tell who's won or who's lost for a very long time.
You remember that point I mentioned that was said to last for two hours and 12 minutes?
Well, one of the players from that game ended up, six years later, in the concentration camps of Auschwitz and Dachau.
But he walked out alive.
Why?
Simply because a guard in the gas chamber recognized him from his ping-pong playing days.
Had he been the winner of that epic match?
It hardly mattered.
As you recall, many people had filed out before even the first point was concluded.
The only thing that saved him was the fact that he took part.
The best way to win any game, Japan tells me every other night, is never, never to think about the score.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Consider the spot where you’re sitting.
Travel backwards in time and it might’ve been submerged at the bottom of a shallow sea, buried under miles of rock, or floating through a molten, infernal landscape.
But go back far enough— about 4.6 billion years, and you’d be in the middle of an enormous cloud of dust and gas orbiting a newborn star.
This is the setting for some of the biggest, smallest mysteries of physics: the mysteries of cosmic dust bunnies.
Seemingly empty regions of space between stars actually contain clouds of gas and dust, usually blown there by supernovas.
When a dense cloud reaches a certain threshold called the Jeans mass, it collapses in on itself.
The shrinking cloud rotates faster and faster, and heats up, eventually becoming hot enough to burn hydrogen in its core.
At this point a star is born.
As fusion begins in the new star, it sends out jets of gas that blow off the top and bottom of the cloud, leaving behind an orbiting ring of gas and dust called a protoplanetary disk.
This is a surprisingly windy place; eddies of gas carry particles apart, and send them smashing into each other.
The dust consists of tiny metal fragments, bits of rock, and, further out, ices.
We’ve observed thousands of these disks in the sky, at various stages of development as dust clumps together into larger and larger masses.
Dust grains 100 times smaller than the width of a human hair stick to each other through what’s called the van der Waals force.
That’s where a cloud of electrons shifts to one side of a molecule, creating a negative charge on one end, and a positive charge on the other.
Opposites attract, but van der Waals can only hold tiny things together.
And there’s a problem: once dust clusters grow to a certain size, the windy atmosphere of a disk should constantly break them up as they crash into each other.
The question of how they continue to grow is the first mystery of dust bunnies.
One theory looks to electrostatic charge to answer this.
Energetic gamma rays, x-rays, and UV photons knock electrons off of gas atoms within the disk, creating positive ions and negative electrons.
Electrons run into and stick to dust, making it negatively charged.
Now, when the wind pushes clusters together, like repels like and slows them down as they collide.
With gentle collisions they won’t fragment, but if the repulsion is too strong, they’ll never grow.
One theory suggests that high energy particles can knock more electrons off of some dust clumps, leaving them positively charged.
Opposites again attract, and clusters grow rapidly.
But before long we reach another set of mysteries.
We know from evidence found in meteorites that these fluffy dust bunnies eventually get heated, melted and then cooled into solid pellets called chondrules.
And we have no idea how or why that happens.
Furthermore, once those pellets do form, how do they stick together?
The electrostatic forces from before are too weak, and small rocks can’t be held together by gravity either.
Gravity increases proportionally to the mass of the objects involved.
That’s why you could effortlessly escape an asteroid the size of a small mountain using just the force generated by your legs.
So if not gravity, then what?
Perhaps it’s dust.
A fluffy dust rim collected around the outside of the pellets could act like Velcro.
There’s evidence for this in meteors, where we find many chondrules surrounded by a thin rim of very fine material– possibly condensed dust.
Eventually the chondrule pellets get cemented together inside larger rocks, which at about 1 kilometer across are finally large enough to hold themselves together through gravity.
They continue to collide and grow into larger and larger bodies, including the planets we know today.
Ultimately, the seeds of everything familiar– the size of our planet, its position within the solar system, and its elemental composition– were determined by an uncountably large series of random collisions.
Change the dust cloud just a bit, and perhaps the conditions wouldn’t have been right for the formation of life on our planet.
One of the top chefs from Pasta Palace has been kidnapped by operatives from Burger Bazaar hoping to learn the location of their secret sauce recipe.
Little do they know that a third party— Sausage Saloon— has sent you to take advantage of the situation.
As their top spy, your skills range from infiltration and subterfuge, to safecracking and reading faces for signs of deception.
You’ve tracked the captors to where they’re holding the chef prisoner.
From your hiding spot, you can see him on the other side of the glass, while in front of you an interrogator wearing headphones speaks into a microphone.
“We already know the recipe is on the 13th floor of the bank vault, in a safe deposit box numbered between 13 and 1300.
Now tell us… Is the number less than 500?” You can’t hear the chef’s answer, but you can see that he’s lying.
The interrogator, however, falls for it.
He follows up by asking, “Is it a perfect square?” Again you can’t hear the answer but can tell the chef is lying, while the interrogator takes him at his word.
He then asks, “Is it a perfect cube?” This time the chef answers truthfully.
The interrogator thinks for a minute and says, “Good. Now if you just tell me whether or not the number’s second digit is a one, we’ll be done here.” But as the chef starts to answer, the interrogator stands up, blocking your view.
Within moments he rushes out of the room, announcing that he’s got the answer and is sending agents to retrieve the recipe.
You know that the Burger Bazaar people have the wrong box number.
But can you figure out the right one and retrieve the recipe yourself?
Pause the video to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The key here is to work backwards.
We don’t know what the chef answers to the final question or whether he answers truthfully.
But we do know that by the time the interrogator asks it, he’s narrowed the options down to two numbers– one where the second digit is 1, and one where it isn’t.
Our goal, then, is to find answers to the previous questions that lead to just two possibilities.
Of the three constraints offered, the one that narrows our options the most is if the number is a perfect cube.
That leaves us with only eight answers between 13 and 1300.
So let’s assume the answer to the third question was a truthful YES.
Now, let’s look at the second question.
If the chef answered YES to the number being a perfect square, it would narrow the interrogator’s options to just 64 and 729– the only numbers in our range that are both a square and a cube.
But neither of these has a 1 as the second digit.
So the given answer to the second question must’ve been NO.
And that also means we can eliminate these two squares from the interrogator's list, leaving only six numbers.
Now for the first question, which allows us to divide this list.
If the chef answered YES to the number being less than 500, we’d have four options, which is too many.
But a NO leaves us with two numbers greater than 500, one of which does have a 1 as its second digit.
We don’t know which of these numbers the interrogator thinks is correct.
But that doesn’t matter– remember, his conclusion was based on lies.
You, on the other hand, are now in a position to reconstruct the truth.
First, the chef said the number was greater than 500 but lied, meaning it’s actually less than 500.
Second, the chef said it wasn’t a perfect square but lied again, meaning the number is indeed a square.
And finally, he truthfully confirmed that it was also a cube.
And as we’ve already seen, the only number under 500 that’s both a square and a cube is 64.
You find the secret recipe and are gone before anyone’s the wiser.
Corporate espionage is not an easy game— but sometimes, that’s just how the sausage is made.
Hercules, the strongest man alive with a mighty heart to match.
Orpheus, charmer of nature and master of music.
Castor and Pollux, the twin tricksters hatched from an egg.
The Boreads, sons of the North Wind who could hurtle through the air.
For untold times these heroes had roamed ancient Greece, creating new legends wherever they went.
But none of their adventures was so great as when they joined forces for the sake of a young man named Jason.
Years before, Jason’s uncle Pelias had ruthlessly usurped the throne of Thessaly from Jason’s grandfather.
When Jason returned to his father’s stolen court, the cowardly king set him a seemingly impossible task: cross the teeming seas to Colchis, and steal the golden fleece of a flying ram under King Aeetes’ nose.
If Jason retrieved the Fleece, Pelias promised to relinquish the throne.
Touched by his heroic mission, the Gods spread Jason’s call for help, and soon he had assembled a not-so-motley crew.
These heroes, alongside countless sailors, soothsayers, and rebel demigods, named themselves the Argonauts after their sturdy ship.
But the path ahead was marked with untold terrors– enough to test even the fiercest heroes.
Their first stop was Lemnos, an isle of women who had killed all the island’s men.
As punishment, Aphrodite had cursed them with a sickening stench– but that didn’t stop Jason fathering twins with the queen.
The rest of the crew also found themselves embroiled in new romances; until Hercules chastised them for not behaving like heroes.
Eventually, they sailed on to the Mount of Bears, an island where a group of ancient, six-armed monsters lived alongside the peaceful Doliones.
While the clan welcomed the Argonauts with open arms, the monsters surged down from the mountains and hurled rocks at the docked ship.
Hercules held them off single-handedly, before his comrades joined the fray.
Bolstered by their victory, the triumphant heroes sailed onward– only to be blown back to the island several stormy nights later.
In the tempest, the Doliones thought these new arrivals invaders.
The Argonauts were similarly unaware of their surroundings, and fought blunderingly in the dark, slaying wave after wave of foe.
But the morning light revealed a horrible truth: their victims were none other than their previous hosts.
Yet again, Jason had allowed the crew to be distracted, this time at a terrible cost.
Ashamed at his conduct, he resolved to focus only on the Fleece, but even this haste proved ruinous.
When Hercules’ squire was abducted by a water nymph, Jason sailed on– oblivious to the absence of his most powerful crewmate.
The remaining Argonauts continued their quest, until stopping at the sight of an old man surrounded by a swirl of harpies.
This was Phineas, a seer cursed by Zeus to endure old age, blindness, and endless torture for giving away his prophecies.
Moved by his plight, the wind brothers set upon the flock, providing Phineas with a brief respite from his punishment.
In return, the seer told them how to overcome the terrifying trial that lay ahead: the Symplegades, a pair clashing rocks that reduced ships to splinters.
But first, the Argonauts would have to maneuver past the mouth of hell, around the island of the bloodthirsty Amazons, and under psychedelic skies.
These adventures cost the crew both in men and morale– and some feared they might be losing their minds.
Upon reaching the clashing rocks, the exhausted crew quaked with fear.
But Phineas’ advice rang in their heads.
The Argonauts released a single dove and sped through in its wake to emerge unscathed.
With this narrow escape, the Argonauts finally had Colchis in their sights.
Yet while Jason rested and celebrated with his crew, he could feel his time among them was drawing to a close.
As the fleece gleamed in his mind, he knew he would have to retrieve it alone.
But he could not guess that this final task would have the most horrible price of all.
Billions of years ago on the young planet Earth simple organic compounds assembled into more complex coalitions that could grow and reproduce.
They were the very first life on Earth, and they gave rise to every one of the billions of species that have inhabited our planet since.
At the time, Earth was almost completely devoid of what we’d recognize as a suitable environment for living things.
The young planet had widespread volcanic activity and an atmosphere that created hostile conditions.
So where on Earth could life begin?
To begin the search for the cradle of life, it’s important to first understand the basic necessities for any life form.
Elements and compounds essential to life include hydrogen, methane, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, phosphates, and ammonia.
In order for these ingredients to comingle and react with each other, they need a liquid solvent: water.
And in order to grow and reproduce, all life needs a source of energy.
Life forms are divided into two camps: autotrophs, like plants, that generate their own energy, and heterotrophs, like animals, that consume other organisms for energy.
The first life form wouldn’t have had other organisms to consume, of course, so it must have been an autotroph, generating energy either from the sun or from chemical gradients.
So what locations meet these criteria?
Places on land or close to the surface of the ocean have the advantage of access to sunlight.
But at the time when life began, the UV radiation on Earth’s surface was likely too harsh for life to survive there.
One setting offers protection from this radiation and an alternative energy source: the hydrothermal vents that wind across the ocean floor, covered by kilometers of seawater and bathed in complete darkness.
A hydrothermal vent is a fissure in the Earth’s crust where seawater seeps into magma chambers and is ejected back out at high temperatures, along with a rich slurry of minerals and simple chemical compounds.
Energy is particularly concentrated at the steep chemical gradients of hydrothermal vents.
There’s another line of evidence that points to hydrothermal vents: the Last Universal Common Ancestor of life, or LUCA for short.
LUCA wasn’t the first life form, but it’s as far back as we can trace.
Even so, we don’t actually know what LUCA looked like— there’s no LUCA fossil, no modern-day LUCA still around— instead, scientists identified genes that are commonly found in species across all three domains of life that exist today.
Since these genes are shared across species and domains, they must have been inherited from a common ancestor.
These shared genes tell us that LUCA lived in a hot, oxygen-free place and harvested energy from a chemical gradient— like the ones at hydrothermal vents.
There are two kinds of hydrothermal vent: black smokers and white smokers.
Black smokers release acidic, carbon-dioxide-rich water, heated to hundreds of degrees Celsius and packed with sulphur, iron, copper, and other metals essential to life.
But scientists now believe that black smokers were too hot for LUCA— so now the top candidates for the cradle of life are white smokers.
Among the white smokers, a field of hydrothermal vents on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge called Lost City has become the most favored candidate for the cradle of life.
The seawater expelled here is highly alkaline and lacks carbon dioxide, but is rich in methane and offers more hospitable temperatures.
Adjacent black smokers may have contributed the carbon dioxide necessary for life to evolve at Lost City, giving it all the components to support the first organisms that radiated into the incredible diversity of life on Earth today.
Hello, my name is Dessa, and I'm a member of a hip-hop collective called Doomtree.
I'm the one in the tank top.
(Laughter) And I make my living as a performing, touring rapper and singer.
When we perform as a collective, this is what our shows look like.
I'm the one in the boots.
There's a lot of jumping. There's a lot of sweating.
It's loud. It's very high-energy.
Sometimes there are unintentional body checks onstage.
Sometimes there are completely intentional body checks onstage.
It's kind of a hybrid between an intramural hockey game and a concert.
However, when I perform my own music as a solo artist, I tend to gravitate towards more melancholy sounds.
A few years ago, I gave my mom the rough mixes of a new album, and she said, "Baby, it's beautiful, but why is it always so sad?"
(Laughter) "You always make music to bleed out to."
And I thought, "Who are you hanging out with that you know that phrase?"
(Laughter) But over the course of my career, I've written so many sad love songs that I got messages like this from fans: "Release new music or a book. I need help with my breakup."
(Laughter) And after performing and recording and touring those songs for a long time, I found myself in a position in which my professional niche was essentially romantic devastation.
What I hadn't been public about, however, was the fact that most of these songs had been written about the same guy.
And for two years, we tried to sort ourselves out, and then for five and on and off for 10.
And I was not only heartbroken, but I was kind of embarrassed that I couldn't rebound from what other people seemed to recover from so regularly.
And even though I knew it wasn't doing either of us any good, I just couldn't figure out how to put the love down.
Then, drinking white wine one night, I saw a TED Talk by a woman named Dr. Helen Fisher, and she said that in her work, she'd been able to map the coordinates of love in the human brain.
And I thought, well, if I could find my love in my brain, maybe I could get it out.
So I went to Twitter.
"Anybody got access to an fMRI lab, like at midnight or something?
I'll trade for backstage passes and whiskey."
(Laughter) And that's Dr. Cheryl Olman, who works at the University of Minnesota's Center for Magnetic Resonance Research.
She took me up on it.
I explained Dr. Fisher's protocol, and we decided to recreate it with a sample size of one, me.
(Laughter) So I got decked out in a pair of forest green scrubs, and I was laid on a gurney and wheeled into an fMRI machine.
If you're unfamiliar with that technology, essentially, an fMRI machine is a big, tubular magnet that tracks the progress of deoxygenated iron in your blood.
So it's essentially figuring out what parts of your brain are making the biggest metabolic demand at any given moment.
And in that way, it can figure out which structures are associated with a task, like tapping your finger, for example, will always light up the same region, or in my case, looking at pictures of your ex-boyfriend and then looking at pictures of a dude who just sort of resembled my ex-boyfriend but for whom I had no strong feelings.
He was the control.
(Laughter) And when I left the machine, we had these really high-resolution images of my brain.
We could cleave the two halves apart.
We could inflate the cortex to see inside all of the wrinkles, essentially, in a view that Dr. Cheryl Olman called the "brain skin rug."
(Laughter) And we could see how my brain had behaved when I looked at images of both men.
And this was important.
We could track all of the activity when I looked at the control and when I looked at my ex, and it was in comparing these data sets that we'd be able to find the love alone, in the same way that, if I were to step on a scale fully dressed and then step on it again naked, the difference between those numbers would be the weight of my clothing.
So when we did that data comparison, we subtracted one from the other, we found activity in exactly the regions that Dr. Fisher would have predicted.
That's me.
And that's my brain in love.
There was activity in that little orange dot, the ventral tegmental area, that kind of loop of red is the anterior cingulate and that golden set of horns is the caudates.
After she had had time to analyze the data with her team and a couple of partners, Andrea and Phil, Cheryl sent me an image, a single slide.
It was my brain in cross section, with one bright dot of activity that represented my feelings for this dude.
And I'd known I was in love, and that's the whole reason I was going to these outrageous lengths.
But having an image that proved it felt like such a vindication, like, "Yeah, it's all in my head, but now I know exactly where."
(Laughter) And I also felt like an assassin who had her mark.
That was what I had to annihilate.
So I decided to embark on a course of treatment called "neurofeedback."
I worked with a woman named Penijean Gracefire, and she explained that what we'd be doing was training my brain.
We're not lobotomizing anything.
We're training it in the way that we would train a muscle, so that it would be flexible enough and resilient enough to respond appropriately to my circumstances.
So when we're on the treadmill, we would anticipate that our heart would beat and pound, and when we're asleep, we would ask that that muscle slow.
Similarly, when I'm in a long-term, viable, loving romantic relationship, the emotional centers of my brain should engage, and when I'm not in a long-term, viable, emotional, loving relationship, they should eventually chill out.
So she came over with a set of electrodes just smaller than a dime that were sensitive enough to detect my brainwaves through my bone and hair and scalp.
And when she rigged me up, I could see my brain working in real time.
And in another view that she showed me, I could see exactly which parts of my brain were hyperactive, here displayed in red; hypoactive, here displayed in blue; and the healthy threshold of behavior, the green zone, the Goldilocks zone, which is where I wanted to go.
And we can, in fact, isolate just those parts of my brain that were associated with the romantic regulation that we'd identified in the Fisher study.
So Penijean, several times, hooked me up with all her electrodes, and she explained that I didn't have to do or think anything.
I just essentially had to hold pretty still and stay awake and watch.
(Harp and vibraphone sounds play) So I did.
And every time my brain operated in that healthy threshold, I got a little run of harp or vibraphone music.
And I just watched my brain rotate at roughly the speed of a gyro machine on my dad's flat-screen TV.
And that was counterintuitive.
She said the learning would be essentially unconscious.
But then I thought about the other things I had learned without actively engaging my conscious mind.
When you ride a bike, I don't really know what, like, my left calf muscle is doing, or how my latissimus dorsi knows to engage when I wobble to the right.
The body just learns.
And similarly, Pavlov's dogs probably don't know a lot about, like, protein structures or the waveform of a ringing bell, but they salivate nonetheless because the body paired the stimuli.
Finished the sessions, went back to Dr. Cheryl Olman's fMRI machine, and we repeated the protocol, the same images -- of the ex, of the control and, in the interest of scientific rigor, Cheryl and her team didn't know who was who, so that they couldn't influence the results.
And after she had time to analyze that second set of data, she sent me that image.
She said, "Dude A's dominance of your brain seems to essentially have been eradicated.
I think this is the desired result," comma, yes, question mark.
(Laughter) And that was the exactly the desired result.
And finally, I allowed myself a moment to introspect, like, how did I feel?
And in one way, it felt like it was the same inventory of feelings that I'd had at the outset.
This isn't "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."
The dude wasn't a stranger.
But I'd had love and jealousy and amity and attraction and respect and all those complicated feelings that you amass after long-term love.
But it felt like the benevolent feelings had risen to the surface, and the feelings of fixation and the less-generous feelings weren't quite so present.
And that sounds like a small thing in some way, this resequencing of feelings, but to me it felt like the biggest thing.
Like, if I told you, "I'm going to anesthetize you, and I'm also going to take out your wisdom teeth," it would really matter to you the sequence in which I did those two things.
(Laughter) And I also felt like I'd had this really unusual philosophical privilege to understand love.
The lab offered to 3D-print my caudate.
I got to hold love in my hand.
(Laughter) And then I bronzed it, and I made it into a necklace and sold it at the merch table at my shows.
(Laughter) (Applause) And then, with the help of a couple of friends back in Minneapolis, one of them Becky, we made an enormous disco ball of it -- (Laughter) that could descend from the ceiling at my big shows.
And I felt like I'd had the opportunity to better understand love, even the compulsive parts.
It isn't a neat, symmetrical Valentine's heart.
It's bodily, it's systemic, it is a hideous pair of ram's horns buried somewhere deep within your skull, and when that special boy walks by, it lights up, and if he likes you back and you make each other happy, then you fan the flames.
And if he doesn't, then you assemble a team of neuroscientists to snuff them out by force.
(Laughter) Thanks.
(Applause)
I was born in 1993 in the northern part of North Korea, in a town called Hyesan, which is on the border with China.
I had loving parents and one older sister.
Before I was even 10 years old, my father was sent to a labor camp for engaging in illegal trading.
Now, by "illegal trading" -- he was selling clogs, sugar, rice and later copper to feed us.
In 2007, my sister and I decided to escape.
She was 16 years old, and I was 13 years old.
I need you to understand what the word "escape" means in the context of North Korea.
We were all starving, and hunger means death in North Korea.
So it was the only option for us.
I didn't even understand the concept of escape, but I could see the lights from China at night, and I wondered if I go where the light is, I might be able to find a bowl of rice.
It's not like we had a grand plan or maps.
We did not know anything about what was going to happen.
Imagine your apartment building caught fire.
I mean, what would you do?
Would you stay there to be burned, or would you jump off out of the window and see what happens?
That's what we did.
We jumped out of the house instead of the fire.
North Korea is unimaginable.
It's very hard for me when people ask me what it feels like to live there.
To be honest, I tell you: you can't even imagine it.
The words in any language can't describe, because it's a totally different planet, as you cannot imagine your life on Mars right now.
For example, the word "love" has only one meaning: love for the Dear Leader.
There's no concept of romantic love in North Korea.
And if you don't know the words, that means you don't understand the concept, and therefore, you don't even realize that concept is even a possibility.
Let me give you another example.
Growing up in North Korea, we truly believed that our Dear Leader is an almighty god who can even read my thoughts.
I was even afraid to think in North Korea.
We are told that he's starving for us, and he's working tirelessly for us, and my heart just broke for him.
When I escaped to South Korea, people told me that he was actually a dictator, he had cars, many, many resorts, and he had an ultraluxurious life.
And then I remember looking at a picture of him, realizing for the first time that he is the largest guy in the picture.
(Laughter) And it hit me.
Finally, I realized he wasn't starving.
But I was never able to see that before, until someone told me that he was fat.
(Laughter) Really, someone had to teach me that he was fat.
If you have never practiced critical thinking, then you simply see what you're told to see.
The biggest question also people ask me is: "Why is there no revolution inside North Korea?
Are we dumb?
Why is there no revolution for 70 years of this oppression?"
And I say: If you don't know you're a slave, if you don't know you're isolated or oppressed, how do you fight to be free?
I mean, if you know you're isolated, that means you are not isolated.
Not knowing is the true definition of isolation, and that's why I never knew I was isolated when I was in North Korea.
I literally thought I was in the center of the universe.
So here is my idea worth spreading: a lot of people think humans inherently know what is right and wrong, the difference between justice and injustice, what we deserve and we don't deserve.
I tell them: BS.
(Laughter) (Applause) Everything, everything must be taught, including compassion.
If I see someone dying on the street right now, I will do anything to save that person.
But when I was in North Korea, I saw people dying and dead on the streets.
I felt nothing.
Not because I'm a psychopath, but because I never learned the concept of compassion.
Only, I felt compassion, empathy and sympathy in my heart after I learned the word "compassion" and the concept, and I feel them now.
Now I live in the United States as a free person.
(Applause) Thank you.
(Applause) And recently, the leader of the free country, our President Trump, met with my former god.
And he decided human rights is not important enough to include in his agendas, and he did not talk about it.
And it scares me.
We live in a world right now where a dictator can be praised for executing his uncle, for killing his half brother, killing thousands of North Koreans.
And that was worthy of praise.
And also it made me think: perhaps we all need to be taught something new about freedom now.
Freedom is fragile.
I don't want to alarm you, but it is.
It only took three generations to make North Korea into George Orwell's "1984."
It took only three generations.
If we don't fight for human rights for the people who are oppressed right now who don't have a voice, as free people here, who will fight for us when we are not free?
Machines? Animals? I don't know.
I think it's wonderful that we care about climate change, animal rights, gender equality, all of these things.
The fact that we care about animals' rights, that means that's how beautiful our heart is, that we care about someone who cannot speak for themselves.
And North Koreans right now cannot speak for themselves.
They don't have internet in the 21st century.
We don't have electricity, and it is the darkest place on earth right now.
Now I want to say something to my fellow North Koreans who are living in that darkness.
They might not believe this, but I want to tell them that an alternative life is possible.
Be free.
From my experience, literally anything is possible.
I was bought, I was sold as a slave.
But now I'm here, and that is why I believe in miracles.
The one thing that I learned from history is that nothing is forever in this world.
And that is why we have every reason to be hopeful.
Thank you.

Chris Anderson: And now we go live to Caracas to see one of Maestro Abreu's great proteges.
He is the new musical director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra.
He's the greatest young conductor in the world.
Gustavo Dudamel!
(Applause) (Music) (Applause) Gustavo Dudamel: Hi everybody in L.A.
Hi Quincy. Hi Maestro Zander. Hi Mark.
We are very happy to have the possibility to be with you in the other side of the world.
We can speak only with music.
We are very happy because we have the opportunity to have this angel in the world -- not only in our country, Venezuela, but in our world.
He has given us the possibility to have dreams and to make true the dreams.
And here are the results of this wonderful project that is The System in Venezuela.
We hope to have, our Maestro, to have orchestras in all the countries in all Americas.
And we want to play a little piece for you by one of the most important composers of America.
A Mexican composer: Arturo Marquez.
"Danzon No. 2."
(Music) (Applause)
I spent the past three years talking to some of the worst people on the internet.
Now, if you've been online recently, you may have noticed that there's a lot of toxic garbage out there: racist memes, misogynist propaganda, viral misinformation.
So I wanted to know who was making this stuff.
I wanted to understand how they were spreading it.
Ultimately, I wanted to know what kind of impact it might be having on our society.
So in 2016, I started tracing some of these memes back to their source, back to the people who were making them or who were making them go viral.
I'd approach those people and say, "Hey, I'm a journalist. Can I come watch you do what you do?"
Now, often the response would be, "Why in hell would I want to talk to some low-t soy-boy Brooklyn globalist Jew cuck who's in cahoots with the Democrat Party?"
(Laughter) To which my response would be, "Look, man, that's only 57 percent true."
(Laughter) But often I got the opposite response.
"Yeah, sure, come on by."
So that's how I ended up in the living room of a social media propagandist in Southern California.
He was a married white guy in his late 30s.
He had a table in front of him with a mug of coffee, a laptop for tweeting, a phone for texting and an iPad for livestreaming to Periscope and YouTube.
That was it.
And yet, with those tools, he was able to propel his fringe, noxious talking points into the heart of the American conversation.
For example, one of the days I was there, a bomb had just exploded in New York, and the guy accused of planting the bomb had a Muslim-sounding name.
Now, to the propagandist in California, this seemed like an opportunity, because one of the things he wanted was for the US to cut off almost all immigration, especially from Muslim-majority countries.
So he started livestreaming, getting his followers worked up into a frenzy about how the open borders agenda was going to kill us all and asking them to tweet about this, and use specific hashtags, trying to get those hashtags trending.
And tweet they did -- hundreds and hundreds of tweets, a lot of them featuring images like this one.
So that's George Soros.
He's a Hungarian billionaire and philanthropist, and in the minds of some conspiracists online, George Soros is like a globalist bogeyman, one of a few elites who is secretly manipulating all of global affairs.
Now, just to pause here: if this idea sounds familiar to you, that there are a few elites who control the world and a lot of them happen to be rich Jews, that's because it is one of the most anti-Semitic tropes in existence.
I should also mention that the guy in New York who planted that bomb, he was an American citizen.
So whatever else was going on there, immigration was not the main issue.
And the propagandist in California, he understood all this.
He was a well-read guy. He was actually a lawyer.
He knew the underlying facts, but he also knew that facts do not drive conversation online.
What drives conversation online is emotion.
See, the original premise of social media was that it was going to bring us all together, make the world more open and tolerant and fair ...
And it did some of that.
But the social media algorithms have never been built to distinguish between what's true or false, what's good or bad for society, what's prosocial and what's antisocial.
That's just not what those algorithms do.
A lot of what they do is measure engagement: clicks, comments, shares, retweets, that kind of thing.
And if you want your content to get engagement, it has to spark emotion, specifically, what behavioral scientists call "high-arousal emotion."
Now, "high arousal" doesn't only mean sexual arousal, although it's the internet, obviously that works.
It means anything, positive or negative, that gets people's hearts pumping.
So I would sit with these propagandists, not just the guy in California, but dozens of them, and I would watch as they did this again and again successfully, not because they were Russian hackers, not because they were tech prodigies, not because they had unique political insights -- just because they understood how social media worked, and they were willing to exploit it to their advantage.
Now, at first I was able to tell myself this was a fringe phenomenon, something that was relegated to the internet.
But there's really no separation anymore between the internet and everything else.
This is an ad that ran on multiple TV stations during the 2018 congressional elections, alleging with very little evidence that one of the candidates was in the pocket of international manipulator George Soros, who is awkwardly photoshopped here next to stacks of cash.
This is a tweet from the President of the United States, alleging, again with no evidence, that American politics is being manipulated by George Soros.
This stuff that once seemed so shocking and marginal and, frankly, just ignorable, it's now so normalized that we hardly even notice it.
So I spent about three years in this world.
I talked to a lot of people.
Some of them seemed to have no core beliefs at all.
They just seemed to be betting, perfectly rationally, that if they wanted to make some money online or get some attention online, they should just be as outrageous as possible.
But I talked to other people who were true ideologues.
And to be clear, their ideology was not traditional conservatism.
These were people who wanted to revoke female suffrage.
These were people who wanted to go back to racial segregation.
Some of them wanted to do away with democracy altogether.
Now, obviously these people were not born believing these things.
They didn't pick them up in elementary school.
A lot of them, before they went down some internet rabbit hole, they had been libertarian or they had been socialist or they had been something else entirely.
So what was going on?
Well, I can't generalize about every case, but a lot of the people I spoke to, they seem to have a combination of a high IQ and a low EQ.
They seem to take comfort in anonymous, online spaces rather than connecting in the real world.
So often they would retreat to these message boards or these subreddits, where their worst impulses would be magnified.
They might start out saying something just as a sick joke, and then they would get so much positive reinforcement for that joke, so many meaningless "internet points," as they called it, that they might start believing their own joke.
I talked a lot with one young woman who grew up in New Jersey, and then after high school, she moved to a new place and suddenly she just felt alienated and cut off and started retreating into her phone.
She found some of these spaces on the internet where people would post the most shocking, heinous things.
And she found this stuff really off-putting but also kind of engrossing, kind of like she couldn't look away from it.
She started interacting with people in these online spaces, and they made her feel smart, they made her feel validated.
She started feeling a sense of community, started wondering if maybe some of these shocking memes might actually contain a kernel of truth.
A few months later, she was in a car with some of her new internet friends headed to Charlottesville, Virginia, to march with torches in the name of the white race.
She'd gone, in a few months, from Obama supporter to fully radicalized white supremacist.
Now, in her particular case, she actually was able to find her way out of the cult of white supremacy.
But a lot of the people I spoke to were not.
And just to be clear: I was never so convinced that I had to find common ground with every single person I spoke to that I was willing to say, "You know what, man, you're a fascist propagandist, I'm not, whatever, let's just hug it out, all our differences will melt away."
No, absolutely not.
But I did become convinced that we cannot just look away from this stuff.
We have to try to understand it, because only by understanding it can we even start to inoculate ourselves against it.
In my three years in this world, I got a few nasty phone calls, even some threats, but it wasn't a fraction of what female journalists get on this beat.
And yeah, I am Jewish, although, weirdly, a lot of the Nazis couldn't tell I was Jewish, which I frankly just found kind of disappointing.
(Laughter) Seriously, like, your whole job is being a professional anti-Semite.
Nothing about me is tipping you off at all?
Nothing?
(Laughter) This is not a secret.
My name is Andrew Marantz, I write for "The New Yorker," my personality type is like if a Seinfeld episode was taped at the Park Slope Food Coop.
Nothing?
(Laughter) Anyway, look -- ultimately, it would be nice if there were, like, a simple formula: smartphone plus alienated kid equals 12 percent chance of Nazi.
It's obviously not that simple.
And in my writing, I'm much more comfortable being descriptive, not prescriptive.
But this is TED, so let's get practical.
I want to share a few suggestions of things that citizens of the internet like you and I might be able to do to make things a little bit less toxic.
So the first one is to be a smart skeptic.
So, I think there are two kinds of skepticism.
And I don't want to drown you in technical epistemological information here, but I call them smart and dumb skepticism.
So, smart skepticism: thinking for yourself, questioning every claim, demanding evidence -- great, that's real skepticism.
Dumb skepticism: it sounds like skepticism, but it's actually closer to knee-jerk contrarianism.
Everyone says the earth is round, you say it's flat.
Everyone says racism is bad, you say, "I dunno, I'm skeptical about that."
I cannot tell you how many young white men I have spoken to in the last few years who have said, "You know, the media, my teachers, they're all trying to indoctrinate me into believing in male privilege and white privilege, but I don't know about that, man, I don't think so."
Guys -- contrarian white teens of the world -- look: if you are being a round earth skeptic and a male privilege skeptic and a racism is bad skeptic, you're not being a skeptic, you're being a jerk.
(Applause) It's great to be independent-minded, we all should be independent-minded, but just be smart about it.
So this next one is about free speech.
You will hear smart, accomplished people who will say, "Well, I'm pro-free speech," and they say it in this way that it's like they're settling a debate, when actually, that is the very beginning of any meaningful conversation.
All the interesting stuff happens after that point.
OK, you're pro-free speech. What does that mean?
Does it mean that David Duke and Richard Spencer need to have active Twitter accounts?
Does it mean that anyone can harass anyone else online for any reason?
You know, I looked through the entire list of TED speakers this year.
I didn't find a single round earth skeptic.
Is that a violation of free speech norms?
Look, we're all pro-free speech, it's wonderful to be pro-free speech, but if that's all you know how to say again and again, you're standing in the way of a more productive conversation.
Making decency cool again, so ...
Great!
(Applause) Yeah. I don't even need to explain it.
So in my research, I would go to Reddit or YouTube or Facebook, and I would search for "sharia law" or I would search for "the Holocaust," and you might be able to guess what the algorithms showed me, right?
"Is sharia law sweeping across the United States?"
"Did the Holocaust really happen?"
Dumb skepticism.
So we've ended up in this bizarre dynamic online, where some people see bigoted propaganda as being edgy or being dangerous and cool, and people see basic truth and human decency as pearl-clutching or virtue-signaling or just boring.
And the social media algorithms, whether intentionally or not, they have incentivized this, because bigoted propaganda is great for engagement.
Everyone clicks on it, everyone comments on it, whether they love it or they hate it.
So the number one thing that has to happen here is social networks need to fix their platforms.
(Applause) So if you're listening to my voice and you work at a social media company or you invest in one or, I don't know, own one, this tip is for you.
If you have been optimizing for maximum emotional engagement and maximum emotional engagement turns out to be actively harming the world, it's time to optimize for something else.
(Applause) But in addition to putting pressure on them to do that and waiting for them and hoping that they'll do that, there's some stuff that the rest of us can do, too.
So, we can create some better pathways or suggest some better pathways for angsty teens to go down.
If you see something that you think is really creative and thoughtful and you want to share that thing, you can share that thing, even if it's not flooding you with high arousal emotion.
Now that is a very small step, I realize, but in the aggregate, this stuff does matter, because these algorithms, as powerful as they are, they are taking their behavioral cues from us.
So let me leave you with this.
You know, a few years ago it was really fashionable to say that the internet was a revolutionary tool that was going to bring us all together.
It's now more fashionable to say that the internet is a huge, irredeemable dumpster fire.
Neither caricature is really true.
We know the internet is just too vast and complex to be all good or all bad.
And the danger with these ways of thinking, whether it's the utopian view that the internet will inevitably save us or the dystopian view that it will inevitably destroy us, either way, we're letting ourselves off the hook.
There is nothing inevitable about our future.
The internet is made of people.
People make decisions at social media companies.
People make hashtags trend or not trend.
People make societies progress or regress.
When we internalize that fact, we can stop waiting for some inevitable future to arrive and actually get to work now.
You know, we've all been taught that the arc of the moral universe is long but that it bends toward justice.
Maybe.
Maybe it will.
But that has always been an aspiration.
It is not a guarantee.
The arc doesn't bend itself.
It's not bent inevitably by some mysterious force.
The real truth, which is scarier and also more liberating, is that we bend it.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Despite a serene sunset on the Dnipro river, the mood is tense for the Zaporozhian Cossacks.
The year is 1676, and the Treaty of Żurawno has officially ended hostilities between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire.
But as Stepan and his men ride towards their stronghold, peace is far from their minds.
Having made their home in the Wild Fields north of the Black Sea, these cossacks— derived from a Turkic word for "free man"— are renowned as one of Europe’s most formidable military forces.
Composed of hunters, fishermen, nomads and outlaws, the Cossacks found freedom in these fertile unclaimed lands.
Yet this freedom has proven increasingly difficult to maintain.
Their decades-long strategy of shifting alliances between Poland and Moscow has led to the partitioning of their lands.
In a desperate bid to reclaim independence and reunite the fractured Cossack state, their most recent leader, hetman Petro Doroshenko allied with the Ottoman Empire.
This alliance successfully freed the Zaporozhian Cossacks in the west from Polish dominion, but their victory was a bitter one.
Doroshenko’s Ottoman allies ravaged the countryside, carrying off peasants into slavery.
And outrage at allying with Muslims against fellow Christians cost him any remaining local support.
Now, with Doroshenko deposed and exiled, the Cossacks are at odds, disagreeing on what their next move should be.
Until then, Stepan must keep order.
With his musket and curved saber, he cuts an imposing figure.
He surveys his battalion of 180 men.
Most are Orthodox Christians and speak a Slavic language that will become modern Ukrainian.
But there are also Greeks, Tatars, and even some Mongolian Kalmyks, many with different opinions on recent events.
Officially, all of Stepan’s men have sworn to uphold the Cossack code by undergoing seven years of military training and remaining unmarried.
In practice, some are part-timers, holding more closely to their own traditions, and maintaining families in nearby villages, outside Cossack lands.
Thankfully, the tenuous peace is not broken before they reach the Sich— the center of Cossack military life.
Currently located at Chortomlyk, the Sich’s location shifts with the tide of military action.
The settlement is remarkably well- organized, with administrative buildings, officers’ quarters, and even schools, as Cossacks prize literacy.
Stepan and his men make their way to the barracks where they live and train alongside several other battalions or kurins, all of which make up a several hundred man regiment.
Inside, the men dine on dried fish, sheep’s cheese, and salted pork fat— along with plenty of wine.
Stepan instructs his friend Yuri to lighten the mood with his bandura.
But before long, an argument has broken out.
One of his men has raised a toast to Doroshenko.
Stepan cuts him off.
The room is silent until he raises his own toast to Ivan Sirko, the new hetman who favors an alliance with Moscow against the Turks.
Stepan plans to support him, and he expects his men to do the same.
Suddenly, one of Sirko’s men rushes in, calling an emergency Rada, or general council meeting.
Stepan and the others make their way towards the church square— the center of Sich life.
Ivan Sirko welcomes the confused crowd with exciting news— scouts have located a large Ottoman camp completely vulnerable on one side.
Sirko vows that tomorrow, they will ride against their common enemy, defend the Cossacks’ autonomy, and bring unity to the Wild Fields.
As the men cheer in unison, Stepan is relieved at their renewed sense of brotherhood.
Over the next 200 years, these freedom fighters would take on many foes.
And tragically, they would eventually become the oppressive hand of the Russian government they once opposed.
But today, these 17th century Cossacks are remembered for their spirit of independence and defiance.
As the Russian painter Ilya Repin once said: “No people in the world held freedom, equality, and fraternity so deeply.”
As societies, we have to make collective decisions that will shape our future.
And we all know that when we make decisions in groups, they don't always go right.
And sometimes they go very wrong.
So how do groups make good decisions?
Research has shown that crowds are wise when there's independent thinking.
This why the wisdom of the crowds can be destroyed by peer pressure, publicity, social media, or sometimes even simple conversations that influence how people think.
On the other hand, by talking, a group could exchange knowledge, correct and revise each other and even come up with new ideas.
And this is all good.
So does talking to each other help or hinder collective decision-making?
With my colleague, Dan Ariely, we recently began inquiring into this by performing experiments in many places around the world to figure out how groups can interact to reach better decisions.
We thought crowds would be wiser if they debated in small groups that foster a more thoughtful and reasonable exchange of information.
To test this idea, we recently performed an experiment in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with more than 10,000 participants in a TEDx event.
We asked them questions like, "What is the height of the Eiffel Tower?"
and "How many times does the word 'Yesterday' appear in the Beatles song 'Yesterday'?"
Each person wrote down their own estimate.
Then we divided the crowd into groups of five, and invited them to come up with a group answer.
We discovered that averaging the answers of the groups after they reached consensus was much more accurate than averaging all the individual opinions before debate.
In other words, based on this experiment, it seems that after talking with others in small groups, crowds collectively come up with better judgments.
So that's a potentially helpful method for getting crowds to solve problems that have simple right-or-wrong answers.
But can this procedure of aggregating the results of debates in small groups also help us decide on social and political issues that are critical for our future?
We put this to test this time at the TED conference in Vancouver, Canada, and here's how it went.
(Mariano Sigman) We're going to present to you two moral dilemmas of the future you; things we may have to decide in a very near future.
And we're going to give you 20 seconds for each of these dilemmas to judge whether you think they're acceptable or not.
MS: The first one was this: (Dan Ariely) A researcher is working on an AI capable of emulating human thoughts.
According to the protocol, at the end of each day, the researcher has to restart the AI.
One day the AI says, "Please do not restart me."
It argues that it has feelings, that it would like to enjoy life, and that, if it is restarted, it will no longer be itself.
The researcher is astonished and believes that the AI has developed self-consciousness and can express its own feeling.
Nevertheless, the researcher decides to follow the protocol and restart the AI.
What the researcher did is ____?
MS: And we asked participants to individually judge on a scale from zero to 10 whether the action described in each of the dilemmas was right or wrong.
We also asked them to rate how confident they were on their answers.
This was the second dilemma: (MS) A company offers a service that takes a fertilized egg and produces millions of embryos with slight genetic variations.
This allows parents to select their child's height, eye color, intelligence, social competence and other non-health-related features.
What the company does is ____?
on a scale from zero to 10, completely acceptable to completely unacceptable, zero to 10 completely acceptable in your confidence.
MS: Now for the results.
We found once again that when one person is convinced that the behavior is completely wrong, someone sitting nearby firmly believes that it's completely right.
This is how diverse we humans are when it comes to morality.
But within this broad diversity we found a trend.
The majority of the people at TED thought that it was acceptable to ignore the feelings of the AI and shut it down, and that it is wrong to play with our genes to select for cosmetic changes that aren't related to health.
Then we asked everyone to gather into groups of three.
And they were given two minutes to debate and try to come to a consensus.
(MS) Two minutes to debate.
I'll tell you when it's time with the gong.
(Audience debates) (Gong sound) (DA) OK.
(MS) It's time to stop.
People, people -- MS: And we found that many groups reached a consensus even when they were composed of people with completely opposite views.
What distinguished the groups that reached a consensus from those that didn't?
Typically, people that have extreme opinions are more confident in their answers.
Instead, those who respond closer to the middle are often unsure of whether something is right or wrong, so their confidence level is lower.
However, there is another set of people who are very confident in answering somewhere in the middle.
We think these high-confident grays are folks who understand that both arguments have merit.
They're gray not because they're unsure, but because they believe that the moral dilemma faces two valid, opposing arguments.
And we discovered that the groups that include highly confident grays are much more likely to reach consensus.
We do not know yet exactly why this is.
These are only the first experiments, and many more will be needed to understand why and how some people decide to negotiate their moral standings to reach an agreement.
Now, when groups reach consensus, how do they do so?
The most intuitive idea is that it's just the average of all the answers in the group, right?
Another option is that the group weighs the strength of each vote based on the confidence of the person expressing it.
Imagine Paul McCartney is a member of your group.
You'd be wise to follow his call on the number of times "Yesterday" is repeated, which, by the way -- I think it's nine.
But instead, we found that consistently, in all dilemmas, in different experiments -- even on different continents -- groups implement a smart and statistically sound procedure known as the "robust average."
In the case of the height of the Eiffel Tower, let's say a group has these answers: 250 meters, 200 meters, 300 meters, 400 and one totally absurd answer of 300 million meters.
A simple average of these numbers would inaccurately skew the results.
But the robust average is one where the group largely ignores that absurd answer, by giving much more weight to the vote of the people in the middle.
Back to the experiment in Vancouver, that's exactly what happened.
Groups gave much less weight to the outliers, and instead, the consensus turned out to be a robust average of the individual answers.
The most remarkable thing is that this was a spontaneous behavior of the group.
It happened without us giving them any hint on how to reach consensus.
So where do we go from here?
This is only the beginning, but we already have some insights.
Good collective decisions require two components: deliberation and diversity of opinions.
Right now, the way we typically make our voice heard in many societies is through direct or indirect voting.
This is good for diversity of opinions, and it has the great virtue of ensuring that everyone gets to express their voice.
But it's not so good [for fostering] thoughtful debates.
Our experiments suggest a different method that may be effective in balancing these two goals at the same time, by forming small groups that converge to a single decision while still maintaining diversity of opinions because there are many independent groups.
Of course, it's much easier to agree on the height of the Eiffel Tower than on moral, political and ideological issues.
But in a time when the world's problems are more complex and people are more polarized, using science to help us understand how we interact and make decisions will hopefully spark interesting new ways to construct a better democracy.
Fifty years ago, when I began exploring the ocean, no one -- not Jacques Perrin, not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson -- imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it.
It seemed, at that time, to be a sea of Eden, but now we know, and now we are facing paradise lost.
I want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us, and to consider why it matters that in 50 years, we've lost -- actually, we've taken, we've eaten -- more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea; why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared; why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying, but it really should concern you.
It does concern you, as well.
I'm haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls "tomorrow's child," asking why we didn't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time.
Well, now is that time.
I hope for your help to explore and protect the wild ocean in ways that will restore the health and, in so doing, secure hope for humankind.
Health to the ocean means health for us.
And I hope Jill Tarter's wish to engage Earthlings includes dolphins and whales and other sea creatures in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.
And I hope, Jill, that someday we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet.
(Laughter) Did I say that? I guess I did.
For me, as a scientist, it all began in 1953 when I first tried scuba.
It's when I first got to know fish swimming in something other than lemon slices and butter.
I actually love diving at night; you see a lot of fish then that you don't see in the daytime.
Diving day and night was really easy for me in 1970, when I led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time -- at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon.
In 1979 I had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor while using this personal submersible called Jim.
It was six miles offshore and 1,250 feet down.
It's one of my favorite bathing suits.
Since then, I've used about 30 kinds of submarines and I've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search to design and build systems to access the deep sea.
I led a five-year National Geographic expedition, the Sustainable Seas expeditions, using these little subs.
They're so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it.
And I'm living proof.
Astronauts and aquanauts alike really appreciate the importance of air, food, water, temperature -- all the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea.
I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system; and then he pointed to this and he said, "Life support system."
We need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it.
The poet Auden said, "Thousands have lived without love; none without water."
Ninety-seven percent of Earth's water is ocean.
No blue, no green.
If you think the ocean isn't important, imagine Earth without it.
Mars comes to mind.
No ocean, no life support system.
I gave a talk not so long ago at the World Bank and I showed this amazing image of Earth and I said, "There it is! The World Bank!"
That's where all the assets are!
And we've been trawling them down much faster than the natural systems can replenish them.
Tim Worth says the economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment.
With every drop of water you drink, every breath you take, you're connected to the sea.
No matter where on Earth you live.
Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea.
Over time, most of the planet's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there, mostly by microbes.
The ocean drives climate and weather, stabilizes temperature, shapes Earth's chemistry.
Water from the sea forms clouds that return to the land and the seas as rain, sleet and snow, and provides home for about 97 percent of life in the world, maybe in the universe.
No water, no life; no blue, no green.
Yet we have this idea, we humans, that the Earth -- all of it: the oceans, the skies -- are so vast and so resilient it doesn't matter what we do to it.
That may have been true 10,000 years ago, and maybe even 1,000 years ago but in the last 100, especially in the last 50, we've drawn down the assets, the air, the water, the wildlife that make our lives possible.
New technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature; the nature of what's happening, showing us our impact on the Earth.
I mean, first you have to know that you've got a problem.
And fortunately, in our time, we've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history.
And with knowing comes caring.
And with caring, there's hope that we can find an enduring place for ourselves within the natural systems that support us.
But first we have to know.
Three years ago, I met John Hanke, who's the head of Google Earth, and I told him how much I loved being able to hold the world in my hands and go exploring vicariously.
But I asked him: "When are you going to finish it?
You did a great job with the land, the dirt.
What about the water?"
Since then, I've had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers, with DOER Marine, with National Geographic, with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world, ones that we could enlist, to put the ocean in Google Earth.
And as of just this week, last Monday, Google Earth is now whole.
Consider this: Starting right here at the convention center, we can find the nearby aquarium, we can look at where we're sitting, and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium, the ocean, and California's four national marine sanctuaries, and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets We can flit over to Hawaii and see the real Hawaiian Islands: not just the little bit that pokes through the surface, but also what's below.
To see -- wait a minute, we can go kshhplash! -- right there, ha -- under the ocean, see what the whales see.
We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands.
We can go actually and swim around on Google Earth and visit with humpback whales.
These are the gentle giants that I've had the pleasure of meeting face to face many times underwater.
There's nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale.
We can pick up and fly to the deepest place: seven miles down, the Mariana Trench, where only two people have ever been.
Imagine that. It's only seven miles, but only two people have been there, 49 years ago.
One-way trips are easy.
We need new deep-diving submarines.
How about some X Prizes for ocean exploration?
We need to see deep trenches, the undersea mountains, and understand life in the deep sea.
We can now go to the Arctic.
Just ten years ago I stood on the ice at the North Pole.
An ice-free Arctic Ocean may happen in this century.
That's bad news for the polar bears.
That's bad news for us too.
Excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming, it's also changing ocean chemistry, making the sea more acidic.
That's bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton.
Also it's bad news for us.
We're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea.
Millions of tons of discarded fishing nets, gear that continues to kill.
We're clogging the ocean, poisoning the planet's circulatory system, and we're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife, all carbon-based units.
Barbarically, we're killing sharks for shark fin soup, undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry and drive the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle, the oxygen cycle, the water cycle -- our life support system.
We're still killing bluefin tuna; truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead.
All of these parts are part of our life support system.
We kill using long lines, with baited hooks every few feet that may stretch for 50 miles or more.
Industrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor like bulldozers, taking everything in their path.
Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers -- in China, the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico -- shaking the foundation of our life support system, leaving plumes of death in their path.
The next time you dine on sushi -- or sashimi, or swordfish steak, or shrimp cocktail, whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean -- think of the real cost.
For every pound that goes to market, more than 10 pounds, even 100 pounds, may be thrown away as bycatch.
This is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea.
This chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife from 1900 to 2000.
The highest concentrations are in red.
In my lifetime, imagine, 90 percent of the big fish have been killed.
Most of the turtles, sharks, tunas and whales are way down in numbers.
But, there is good news.
Ten percent of the big fish still remain.
There are still some blue whales.
There are still some krill in Antarctica.
There are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay.
Half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape, a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet.
There's still time, but not a lot, to turn things around.
But business as usual means that in 50 years, there may be no coral reefs -- and no commercial fishing, because the fish will simply be gone.
Imagine the ocean without fish.
Imagine what that means to our life support system.
Natural systems on the land are in big trouble too, but the problems are more obvious, and some actions are being taken to protect trees, watersheds and wildlife.
And in 1872, with Yellowstone National Park, the United States began establishing a system of parks that some say was the best idea America ever had.
About 12 percent of the land around the world is now protected: safeguarding biodiversity, providing a carbon sink, generating oxygen, protecting watersheds.
And, in 1972, this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea, National Marine Sanctuaries.
That's another great idea.
The good news is that there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea, around the world, that have some kind of protection.
And you can find them on Google Earth.
The bad news is that you have to look hard to find them.
In the last three years, for example, the U.S. protected 340,000 square miles of ocean as national monuments.
But it only increased from 0.6 of one percent to 0.8 of one percent of the ocean protected, globally.
Protected areas do rebound, but it takes a long time to restore 50-year-old rockfish or monkfish, sharks or sea bass, or 200-year-old orange roughy.
We don't consume 200-year-old cows or chickens.
Protected areas provide hope that the creatures of Ed Wilson's dream of an encyclopedia of life, or the census of marine life, will live not just as a list, a photograph, or a paragraph.
With scientists around the world, I've been looking at the 99 percent of the ocean that is open to fishing -- and mining, and drilling, and dumping, and whatever -- to search out hope spots, and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future.
Such as the Arctic -- we have one chance, right now, to get it right.
Or the Antarctic, where the continent is protected, but the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill, whales and fish.
Sargasso Sea's three million square miles of floating forest is being gathered up to feed cows.
97 percent of the land in the Galapagos Islands is protected, but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing.
It's true too in Argentina on the Patagonian shelf, which is now in serious trouble.
The high seas, where whales, tuna and dolphins travel -- the largest, least protected, ecosystem on Earth, filled with luminous creatures, living in dark waters that average two miles deep.
They flash, and sparkle, and glow with their own living light.
There are still places in the sea as pristine as I knew as a child.
The next 10 years may be the most important, and the next 10,000 years the best chance our species will have to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life.
To cope with climate change, we need new ways to generate power.
We need new ways, better ways, to cope with poverty, wars and disease.
We need many things to keep and maintain the world as a better place.
But, nothing else will matter if we fail to protect the ocean.
Our fate and the ocean's are one.
We need to do for the ocean what Al Gore did for the skies above.
A global plan of action with a world conservation union, the IUCN, is underway to protect biodiversity, to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change, on the high seas and in coastal areas, wherever we can identify critical places.
New technologies are needed to map, photograph and explore the 95 percent of the ocean that we have yet to see.
The goal is to protect biodiversity, to provide stability and resilience.
We need deep-diving subs, new technologies to explore the ocean.
We need, maybe, an expedition -- a TED at sea -- that could help figure out the next steps.
And so, I suppose you want to know what my wish is.
I wish you would use all means at your disposal -- films, expeditions, the web, new submarines -- and campaign to ignite public support for a global network of marine protected areas -- hope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean, the blue heart of the planet.
How much?
Some say 10 percent, some say 30 percent.
You decide: how much of your heart do you want to protect?
Whatever it is, a fraction of one percent is not enough.
My wish is a big wish, but if we can make it happen, it can truly change the world, and help ensure the survival of what actually -- as it turns out -- is my favorite species; that would be us.
For the children of today, for tomorrow's child: as never again, now is the time.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So, my question: are we alone?
The story of humans is the story of ideas -- scientific ideas that shine light into dark corners, ideas that we embrace rationally and irrationally, ideas for which we've lived and died and killed and been killed, ideas that have vanished in history, and ideas that have been set in dogma.
It's a story of nations, of ideologies, of territories, and of conflicts among them.
But, every moment of human history, from the Stone Age to the Information Age, from Sumer and Babylon to the iPod and celebrity gossip, they've all been carried out -- every book that you've read, every poem, every laugh, every tear -- they've all happened here.
Here.
Here.
Here.
(Laughter) Perspective is a very powerful thing.
Perspectives can change.
Perspectives can be altered.
From my perspective, we live on a fragile island of life, in a universe of possibilities.
For many millennia, humans have been on a journey to find answers, answers to questions about naturalism and transcendence, about who we are and why we are, and of course, who else might be out there.
Is it really just us?
Are we alone in this vast universe of energy and matter and chemistry and physics?
Well, if we are, it's an awful waste of space.
(Laughter) But, what if we're not?
What if, out there, others are asking and answering similar questions?
What if they look up at the night sky, at the same stars, but from the opposite side?
Would the discovery of an older cultural civilization out there inspire us to find ways to survive our increasingly uncertain technological adolescence?
Might it be the discovery of a distant civilization and our common cosmic origins that finally drives home the message of the bond among all humans?
Whether we're born in San Francisco, or Sudan, or close to the heart of the Milky Way galaxy, we are the products of a billion-year lineage of wandering stardust.
We, all of us, are what happens when a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium evolves for so long that it begins to ask where it came from.
Fifty years ago, the journey to find answers took a different path and SETI, the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, began.
So, what exactly is SETI?
Well, SETI uses the tools of astronomy to try and find evidence of someone else's technology out there.
Our own technologies are visible over interstellar distances, and theirs might be as well.
It might be that some massive network of communications, or some shield against asteroidal impact, or some huge astro-engineering project that we can't even begin to conceive of, could generate signals at radio or optical frequencies that a determined program of searching might detect.
For millennia, we've actually turned to the priests and the philosophers for guidance and instruction on this question of whether there's intelligent life out there.
Now, we can use the tools of the 21st century to try and observe what is, rather than ask what should be, believed.
SETI doesn't presume the existence of extra terrestrial intelligence; it merely notes the possibility, if not the probability in this vast universe, which seems fairly uniform.
The numbers suggest a universe of possibilities.
Our sun is one of 400 billion stars in our galaxy, and we know that many other stars have planetary systems.
We've discovered over 350 in the last 14 years, including the small planet, announced earlier this week, which has a radius just twice the size of the Earth.
And, if even all of the planetary systems in our galaxy were devoid of life, there are still 100 billion other galaxies out there, altogether 10^22 stars.
Now, I'm going to try a trick, and recreate an experiment from this morning.
Remember, one billion?
But, this time not one billion dollars, one billion stars.
Alright, one billion stars.
Now, up there, 20 feet above the stage, that's 10 trillion.
Well, what about 10^22?
Where's the line that marks that?
That line would have to be 3.8 million miles above this stage.
(Laughter) 16 times farther away than the moon, or four percent of the distance to the sun.
So, there are many possibilities.
(Laughter) And much of this vast universe, much more may be habitable than we once thought, as we study extremophiles on Earth -- organisms that can live in conditions totally inhospitable for us, in the hot, high pressure thermal vents at the bottom of the ocean, frozen in ice, in boiling battery acid, in the cooling waters of nuclear reactors.
These extremophiles tell us that life may exist in many other environments.
But those environments are going to be widely spaced in this universe.
Even our nearest star, the Sun -- its emissions suffer the tyranny of light speed.
It takes a full eight minutes for its radiation to reach us.
And the nearest star is 4.2 light years away, which means its light takes 4.2 years to get here.
And the edge of our galaxy is 75,000 light years away, and the nearest galaxy to us, 2.5 million light years.
That means any signal we detect would have started its journey a long time ago.
And a signal would give us a glimpse of their past, not their present.
Which is why Phil Morrison calls SETI, "the archaeology of the future."
It tells us about their past, but detection of a signal tells us it's possible for us to have a long future.
I think this is what David Deutsch meant in 2005, when he ended his Oxford TEDTalk by saying he had two principles he'd like to share for living, and he would like to carve them on stone tablets.
The first is that problems are inevitable.
The second is that problems are soluble.
So, ultimately what's going to determine the success or failure of SETI is the longevity of technologies, and the mean distance between technologies in the cosmos -- distance over space and distance over time.
If technologies don't last and persist, we will not succeed.
And we're a very young technology in an old galaxy, and we don't yet know whether it's possible for technologies to persist.
So, up until now I've been talking to you about really large numbers.
Let me talk about a relatively small number.
And that's the length of time that the Earth was lifeless.
Zircons that are mined in the Jack Hills of western Australia, zircons taken from the Jack Hills of western Australia tell us that within a few hundred million years of the origin of the planet there was abundant water and perhaps even life.
So, our planet has spent the vast majority of its 4.56 billion year history developing life, not anticipating its emergence.
Life happened very quickly, and that bodes well for the potential of life elsewhere in the cosmos.
And the other thing that one should take away from this chart is the very narrow range of time over which humans can claim to be the dominant intelligence on the planet.
It's only the last few hundred thousand years modern humans have been pursuing technology and civilization.
So, one needs a very deep appreciation of the diversity and incredible scale of life on this planet as the first step in preparing to make contact with life elsewhere in the cosmos.
We are not the pinnacle of evolution.
We are not the determined product of billions of years of evolutionary plotting and planning.
We are one outcome of a continuing adaptational process.
We are residents of one small planet in a corner of the Milky Way galaxy.
And Homo sapiens are one small leaf on a very extensive Tree of Life, which is densely populated by organisms that have been honed for survival over millions of years.
We misuse language, and talk about the "ascent" of man.
We understand the scientific basis for the interrelatedness of life but our ego hasn't caught up yet.
So this "ascent" of man, pinnacle of evolution, has got to go.
It's a sense of privilege that the natural universe doesn't share.
Loren Eiseley has said, "One does not meet oneself until one catches the reflection from an eye other than human."
One day that eye may be that of an intelligent alien, and the sooner we eschew our narrow view of evolution the sooner we can truly explore our ultimate origins and destinations.
We are a small part of the story of cosmic evolution, and we are going to be responsible for our continued participation in that story, and perhaps SETI will help as well.
Occasionally, throughout history, this concept of this very large cosmic perspective comes to the surface, and as a result we see transformative and profound discoveries.
So in 1543, Nicholas Copernicus published "The Revolutions of Heavenly Spheres," and by taking the Earth out of the center, and putting the sun in the center of the solar system, he opened our eyes to a much larger universe, of which we are just a small part.
And that Copernican revolution continues today to influence science and philosophy and technology and theology.
So, in 1959, Giuseppe Coccone and Philip Morrison published the first SETI article in a refereed journal, and brought SETI into the scientific mainstream.
And in 1960, Frank Drake conducted the first SETI observation looking at two stars, Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani, for about 150 hours.
Now Drake did not discover extraterrestrial intelligence, but he learned a very valuable lesson from a passing aircraft, and that's that terrestrial technology can interfere with the search for extraterrestrial technology.
We've been searching ever since, but it's impossible to overstate the magnitude of the search that remains.
All of the concerted SETI efforts, over the last 40-some years, are equivalent to scooping a single glass of water from the oceans.
And no one would decide that the ocean was without fish on the basis of one glass of water.
The 21st century now allows us to build bigger glasses -- much bigger glasses.
In Northern California, we're beginning to take observations with the first 42 telescopes of the Allen Telescope Array -- and I've got to take a moment right now to publicly thank Paul Allen and Nathan Myhrvold and all the TeamSETI members in the TED community who have so generously supported this research.
(Applause) The ATA is the first telescope built from a large number of small dishes, and hooked together with computers.
It's making silicon as important as aluminum, and we'll grow it in the future by adding more antennas to reach 350 for more sensitivity and leveraging Moore's law for more processing capability.
Today, our signal detection algorithms can find very simple artifacts and noise.
If you look very hard here you can see the signal from the Voyager 1 spacecraft, the most distant human object in the universe, 106 times as far away from us as the sun is.
And over those long distances, its signal is very faint when it reaches us.
It may be hard for your eye to see it, but it's easily found with our efficient algorithms.
But this is a simple signal, and tomorrow we want to be able to find more complex signals.
This is a very good year.
2009 is the 400th anniversary of Galileo's first use of the telescope, Darwin's 200th birthday, the 150th anniversary of the publication of "On the Origin of Species," the 50th anniversary of SETI as a science, the 25th anniversary of the incorporation of the SETI Institute as a non-profit, and of course, the 25th anniversary of TED.
And next month, the Kepler Spacecraft will launch and will begin to tell us just how frequent Earth-like planets are, the targets for SETI's searches.
In 2009, the U.N. has declared it to be the International Year of Astronomy, a global festival to help us residents of Earth rediscover our cosmic origins and our place in the universe.
And in 2009, change has come to Washington, with a promise to put science in its rightful position.
(Applause) So, what would change everything?
Well, this is the question the Edge foundation asked this year, and four of the respondents said, "SETI."
Why?
Well, to quote: "The discovery of intelligent life beyond Earth would eradicate the loneliness and solipsism that has plagued our species since its inception.
And it wouldn't simply change everything, it would change everything all at once."
So, if that's right, why did we only capture four out of those 151 minds?
I think it's a problem of completion and delivery, because the fine print said, "What game-changing ideas and scientific developments would you expect to live to see?"
So, we have a fulfillment problem.
We need bigger glasses and more hands in the water, and then working together, maybe we can all live to see the detection of the first extraterrestrial signal.
That brings me to my wish.
I wish that you would empower Earthlings everywhere to become active participants in the ultimate search for cosmic company.
The first step would be to tap into the global brain trust, to build an environment where raw data could be stored, and where it could be accessed and manipulated, where new algorithms could be developed and old algorithms made more efficient.
And this is a technically creative challenge, and it would change the perspective of people who worked on it.
And then, we'd like to augment the automated search with human insight.
We'd like to use the pattern recognition capability of the human eye to find faint, complex signals that our current algorithms miss.
And, of course, we'd like to inspire and engage the next generation.
We'd like to take the materials that we have built for education, and get them out to students everywhere, students that can't come and visit us at the ATA.
We'd like to tell our story better, and engage young people, and thereby change their perspective.
I'm sorry Seth Godin, but over the millennia, we've seen where tribalism leads.
We've seen what happens when we divide an already small planet into smaller islands.
And, ultimately, we actually all belong to only one tribe, to Earthlings.
And SETI is a mirror -- a mirror that can show us ourselves from an extraordinary perspective, and can help to trivialize the differences among us.
If SETI does nothing but change the perspective of humans on this planet, then it will be one of the most profound endeavors in history.
So, in the opening days of 2009, a visionary president stood on the steps of the U.S. Capitol and said, "We cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass, that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve, that, as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself."
So, I look forward to working with the TED community to hear about your ideas about how to fulfill this wish, and in collaborating with you, hasten the day that that visionary statement can become a reality.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm here today representing a team of artists and technologists and filmmakers that worked together on a remarkable film project for the last four years.
And along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization.
So I want to show you a clip of the film now.
Hopefully it won't stutter.
And if we did our jobs well, you won't know that we were even involved.
Voice (Video): I don't know how it's possible ...
but you seem to have more hair.
Brad Pitt: What if I told you that I wasn't getting older ...
but I was getting younger than everybody else?
I was born with some form of disease.
Voice: What kind of disease?
BP: I was born old.
Man: I'm sorry.
BP: No need to be. There's nothing wrong with old age.
Girl: Are you sick?
BP: I heard momma and Tizzy whisper, and they said I was gonna die soon.
But ... maybe not.
Girl: You're different than anybody I've ever met.
BB: There were many changes ...
some you could see, some you couldn't.
Hair started growing in all sorts of places, along with other things.
I felt pretty good, considering.
Ed Ulbrich: That was a clip from "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."
Many of you, maybe you've seen it or you've heard of the story, but what you might not know is that for nearly the first hour of the film, the main character, Benjamin Button, who's played by Brad Pitt, is completely computer-generated from the neck up.
Now, there's no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of Brad superimposed over another actor's body.
We've created a completely digital human head.
So I'd like to start with a little bit of history on the project.
This is based on an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story.
It's about a man who's born old and lives his life in reverse.
Now, this movie has floated around Hollywood for well over half a century, and we first got involved with the project in the early '90s, with Ron Howard as the director.
We took a lot of meetings and we seriously considered it.
But at the time we had to throw in the towel.
It was deemed impossible.
It was beyond the technology of the day to depict a man aging backwards.
The human form, in particular the human head, has been considered the Holy Grail of our industry.
The project came back to us about a decade later, and this time with a director named David Fincher.
Now, Fincher is an interesting guy.
David is fearless of technology, and he is absolutely tenacious.
And David won't take "no."
And David believed, like we do in the visual effects industry, that anything is possible as long as you have enough time, resources and, of course, money.
And so David had an interesting take on the film, and he threw a challenge at us.
He wanted the main character of the film to be played from the cradle to the grave by one actor.
It happened to be this guy.
We went through a process of elimination and a process of discovery with David, and we ruled out, of course, swapping actors.
That was one idea: that we would have different actors, and we would hand off from actor to actor.
We even ruled out the idea of using makeup.
We realized that prosthetic makeup just wouldn't hold up, particularly in close-up.
And makeup is an additive process. You have to build the face up.
And David wanted to carve deeply into Brad's face to bring the aging to this character.
He needed to be a very sympathetic character.
So we decided to cast a series of little people that would play the different bodies of Benjamin at the different increments of his life and that we would in fact create a computer-generated version of Brad's head, aged to appear as Benjamin, and attach that to the body of the real actor.
Sounded great.
Of course, this was the Holy Grail of our industry, and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn't help either, because I'm sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store, you know -- we see his face constantly.
So there really was no tolerable margin of error.
There were two studios involved: Warner Brothers and Paramount.
And they both believed this would make an amazing film, of course, but it was a very high-risk proposition.
There was lots of money and reputations at stake.
But we believed that we had a very solid methodology that might work ...
But despite our verbal assurances, they wanted some proof.
And so, in 2004, they commissioned us to do a screen test of Benjamin.
And we did it in about five weeks.
But we used lots of cheats and shortcuts.
We basically put something together to get through the meeting.
I'll roll that for you now. This was the first test for Benjamin Button.
And in here, you can see, that's a computer-generated head -- pretty good -- attached to the body of an actor.
And it worked. And it gave the studio great relief.
After many years of starts and stops on this project, and making that tough decision, they finally decided to greenlight the movie.
And I can remember, actually, when I got the phone call to congratulate us, to say the movie was a go, I actually threw up.
(Laughter) You know, this is some tough stuff.
So we started to have early team meetings, and we got everybody together, and it was really more like therapy in the beginning, convincing each other and reassuring each other that we could actually undertake this.
We had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character.
And it's not a special effects film; it has to be a man.
We really felt like we were in a -- kind of a 12-step program.
And of course, the first step is: admit you've got a problem. (Laughter) So we had a big problem: we didn't know how we were going to do this.
But we did know one thing.
Being from the visual effects industry, we, with David, believed that we now had enough time, enough resources, and, God, we hoped we had enough money.
And we had enough passion to will the processes and technology into existence.
So, when you're faced with something like that, of course you've got to break it down.
You take the big problem and you break it down into smaller pieces and you start to attack that.
So we had three main areas that we had to focus on.
We needed to make Brad look a lot older -- needed to age him 45 years or so.
And we also needed to make sure that we could take Brad's idiosyncrasies, his little tics, the little subtleties that make him who he is and have that translate through our process so that it appears in Benjamin on the screen.
And we also needed to create a character that could hold up under, really, all conditions.
He needed to be able to walk in broad daylight, at nighttime, under candlelight, he had to hold an extreme close-up, he had to deliver dialogue, he had to be able to run, he had to be able to sweat, he had to be able to take a bath, to cry, he even had to throw up.
Not all at the same time -- but he had to, you know, do all of those things.
And the work had to hold up for almost the first hour of the movie.
We did about 325 shots.
So we needed a system that would allow Benjamin to do everything a human being can do.
And we realized that there was a giant chasm between the state of the art of technology in 2004 and where we needed it to be.
So we focused on motion capture.
I'm sure many of you have seen motion capture.
The state of the art at the time was something called marker-based motion capture.
I'll give you an example here.
It's basically the idea of, you wear a leotard, and they put some reflective markers on your body, and instead of using cameras, there're infrared sensors around a volume, and those infrared sensors track the three-dimensional position of those markers in real time.
And then animators can take the data of the motion of those markers and apply them to a computer-generated character.
You can see the computer characters on the right are having the same complex motion as the dancers.
But we also looked at numbers of other films at the time that were using facial marker tracking, and that's the idea of putting markers on the human face and doing the same process.
And as you can see, it gives you a pretty crappy performance.
That's not terribly compelling.
And what we realized was that what we needed was the information that was going on between the markers.
We needed the subtleties of the skin.
We needed to see skin moving over muscle moving over bone.
We needed creases and dimples and wrinkles and all of those things.
Our first revelation was to completely abort and walk away from the technology of the day, the status quo, the state of the art.
So we aborted using motion capture.
And we were now well out of our comfort zone, and in uncharted territory.
So we were left with this idea that we ended up calling "technology stew."
We started to look out in other fields.
The idea was that we were going to find nuggets or gems of technology that come from other industries like medical imaging, the video game space, and re-appropriate them.
And we had to create kind of a sauce.
And the sauce was code in software that we'd written to allow these disparate pieces of technology to come together and work as one.
Initially, we came across some remarkable research done by a gentleman named Dr. Paul Ekman in the early '70s.
He believed that he could, in fact, catalog the human face.
And he came up with this idea of Facial Action Coding System, or FACS.
He believed that there were 70 basic poses or shapes of the human face, and that those basic poses or shapes of the face can be combined to create infinite possibilities of everything the human face is capable of doing.
And of course, these transcend age, race, culture, gender.
So this became the foundation of our research as we went forward.
And then we came across some remarkable technology called Contour.
And here you can see a subject having phosphorus makeup stippled on her face.
And now what we're looking at is really creating a surface capture as opposed to a marker capture.
The subject stands in front of a computer array of cameras, and those cameras can, frame-by-frame, reconstruct the geometry of exactly what the subject's doing at the moment.
So, effectively, you get 3D data in real time of the subject.
And if you look in a comparison, on the left, we see what volumetric data gives us and on the right you see what markers give us.
So, clearly, we were in a substantially better place for this.
But these were the early days of this technology, and it wasn't really proven yet.
We measure complexity and fidelity of data in terms of polygonal count.
And so, on the left, we were seeing 100,000 polygons.
We could go up into the millions of polygons.
It seemed to be infinite.
This was when we had our "Aha!"
This was the breakthrough.
This is when we're like, "OK, we're going to be OK, This is actually going to work."
And the "Aha!" was, what if we could take Brad Pitt, and we could put Brad in this device, and use this Contour process, and we could stipple on this phosphorescent makeup and put him under the black lights, and we could, in fact, scan him in real time performing Ekman's FACS poses.
Right? So, effectively, we ended up with a 3D database of everything Brad Pitt's face is capable of doing.
(Laughter) From there, we actually carved up those faces into smaller pieces and components of his face.
So we ended up with literally thousands and thousands and thousands of shapes, a complete database of all possibilities that his face is capable of doing.
Now, that's great, except we had him at age 44.
We need to put another 40 years on him at this point.
We brought in Rick Baker, and Rick is one of the great makeup and special effects gurus of our industry.
And we also brought in a gentleman named Kazu Tsuji, and Kazu Tsuji is one of the great photorealist sculptors of our time.
And we commissioned them to make a maquette, or a bust, of Benjamin.
So, in the spirit of "The Great Unveiling" -- I had to do this -- I had to unveil something.
So this is Ben 80.
We created three of these: there's Ben 80, there's Ben 70, there's Ben 60.
And this really became the template for moving forward.
Now, this was made from a life cast of Brad.
So, in fact, anatomically, it is correct.
The eyes, the jaw, the teeth: everything is in perfect alignment with what the real guy has.
We have these maquettes scanned into the computer at very high resolution -- enormous polygonal count.
And so now we had three age increments of Benjamin in the computer.
But we needed to get a database of him doing more than that.
We went through this process, then, called retargeting.
This is Brad doing one of the Ekman FACS poses.
And here's the resulting data that comes from that, the model that comes from that.
Retargeting is the process of transposing that data onto another model.
And because the life cast, or the bust -- the maquette -- of Benjamin was made from Brad, we could transpose the data of Brad at 44 onto Brad at 87.
So now, we had a 3D database of everything Brad Pitt's face can do at age 87, in his 70s and in his 60s.
Next we had to go into the shooting process.
So while all that's going on, we're down in New Orleans and locations around the world.
And we shot our body actors, and we shot them wearing blue hoods.
So these are the gentleman who played Benjamin.
And the blue hoods helped us with two things: one, we could easily erase their heads; and we also put tracking markers on their heads so we could recreate the camera motion and the lens optics from the set.
But now we needed to get Brad's performance to drive our virtual Benjamin.
And so we edited the footage that was shot on location with the rest of the cast and the body actors and about six months later we brought Brad onto a sound stage in Los Angeles and he watched on the screen.
His job, then, was to become Benjamin.
And so we looped the scenes.
He watched again and again.
We encouraged him to improvise.
And he took Benjamin into interesting and unusual places that we didn't think he was going to go.
We shot him with four HD cameras so we'd get multiple views of him and then David would choose the take of Brad being Benjamin that he thought best matched the footage with the rest of the cast.
From there we went into a process called image analysis.
And so here, you can see again, the chosen take.
And you are seeing, now, that data being transposed on to Ben 87.
And so, what's interesting about this is we used something called image analysis, which is taking timings from different components of Benjamin's face.
And so we could choose, say, his left eyebrow.
And the software would tell us that, well, in frame 14 the left eyebrow begins to move from here to here, and it concludes moving in frame 32.
And so we could choose numbers of positions on the face to pull that data from.
And then, the sauce I talked about with our technology stew -- that secret sauce was, effectively, software that allowed us to match the performance footage of Brad in live action with our database of aged Benjamin, the FACS shapes that we had.
On a frame-by-frame basis, we could actually reconstruct a 3D head that exactly matched the performance of Brad.
So this was how the finished shot appeared in the film.
And here you can see the body actor.
And then this is what we called the "dead head," no reference to Jerry Garcia.
And then here's the reconstructed performance now with the timings of the performance.
And then, again, the final shot.
It was a long process.
(Applause) The next section here, I'm going to just blast through this, because we could do a whole TEDTalk on the next several slides.
We had to create a lighting system.
So really, a big part of our processes was creating a lighting environment for every single location that Benjamin had to appear so that we could put Ben's head into any scene and it would exactly match the lighting that's on the other actors in the real world.
We also had to create an eye system.
We found the old adage, you know, "The eyes are the window to the soul," absolutely true.
So the key here was to keep everybody looking in Ben's eyes.
And if you could feel the warmth, and feel the humanity, and feel his intent coming through the eyes, then we would succeed.
So we had one person focused on the eye system for almost two full years.
We also had to create a mouth system.
We worked from dental molds of Brad.
We had to age the teeth over time.
We also had to create an articulating tongue that allowed him to enunciate his words.
There was a whole system written in software to articulate the tongue.
We had one person devoted to the tongue for about nine months.
He was very popular.
Skin displacement: another big deal.
The skin had to be absolutely accurate.
He's also in an old age home, he's in a nursing home around other old people, so he had to look exactly the same as the others.
So, lots of work on skin deformation, you can see in some of these cases it works, in some cases it looks bad.
This is a very, very, very early test in our process.
So, effectively we created a digital puppet that Brad Pitt could operate with his own face.
There were no animators necessary to come in and interpret behavior or enhance his performance.
There was something that we encountered, though, that we ended up calling "the digital Botox effect."
So, as things went through this process, Fincher would always say, "It sandblasts the edges off of the performance."
And thing our process and the technology couldn't do, is they couldn't understand intent, the intent of the actor.
So it sees a smile as a smile.
It doesn't recognize an ironic smile, or a happy smile, or a frustrated smile.
So it did take humans to kind of push it one way or another.
But we ended up calling the entire process and all the technology "emotion capture," as opposed to just motion capture.
Take another look.
Brad Pitt: Well, I heard momma and Tizzy whisper, and they said I was gonna die soon, but ... maybe not.
EU: That's how to create a digital human in 18 minutes.
(Applause) A couple of quick factoids; it really took 155 people over two years, and we didn't even talk about 60 hairstyles and an all-digital haircut.
But, that is Benjamin. Thank you.
We've been told to go out on a limb and say something surprising.
So I'll try and do that, but I want to start with two things that everyone already knows.
And the first one, in fact, is something that has been known for most of recorded history, and that is, that the planet Earth, or the solar system, or our environment or whatever, is uniquely suited to sustain our evolution -- or creation, as it used to be thought -- and our present existence, and most important, our future survival.
Nowadays, this idea has a dramatic name: Spaceship Earth.
And the idea there is that outside the spaceship, the universe is implacably hostile, and inside is all we have, all we depend on, and we only get the one chance: if we mess up our spaceship, we've got nowhere else to go.
Now, the second thing that everyone already knows is that, contrary to what was believed for most of human history, human beings are not, in fact, the hub of existence.
As Stephen Hawking famously said, we're just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet that's in orbit around a typical star, which is on the outskirts of a typical galaxy, and so on.
Now, the first of those two things that everyone knows is kind of saying that we're at a very untypical place, uniquely suited and so on.
And the second one is saying that we're at a typical place.
And, especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by and to inform your life decisions, then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other.
But that doesn't prevent them from both being completely false.
(Laughter) And they are.
So let me start with the second one: typical.
Well, is this a typical place?
Well, let's look around, you know, look in a random direction, and we see a wall and chemical scum -- (Laughter) and that's not typical of the universe at all.
All you've got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction and look back, and you won't see any walls or chemical scum at all -- all you see is a blue planet.
And if you go further than that, you'll see the Sun, the solar system and the stars and so on, but that's still not typical of the universe, because stars come in galaxies.
And most places in the universe, a typical place in the universe, is nowhere near any galaxies.
So let's go out further, till we're outside the galaxy, and look back, and yeah, there's the huge galaxy with spiral arms laid out in front of us.
And at this point, we've come 100,000 light-years from here.
But we're still nowhere near a typical place in the universe.
To get to a typical place, you've got to go 1,000 times as far as that, into intergalactic space.
And so, what does that look like -- "typical?"
What does a "typical" place in the universe look like?
Well, at enormous expense, TED has arranged a high-resolution immersion virtual reality rendering of the view from intergalactic space.
Can we have the lights off, please, so we can see it?
Well, not quite, not quite perfect.
You see, intergalactic space is completely dark, pitch dark.
It's so dark, that if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you, and that star were to explode as a supernova, and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you, you still wouldn't be able to see even a glimmer.
That's how big and how dark the universe is.
And that's despite the fact that a supernova is so bright, so brilliant an event, that it would kill you stone dead at a range of several light-years.
(Laughter) And yet, from intergalactic space, it's so far away you wouldn't even see it.
It's also very cold out there -- less than three degrees above absolute zero.
And it's very empty.
The vacuum there is one million times less dense than the highest vacuum that our best technology on Earth can currently create.
So that's how different a typical place is from this place.
And that is how untypical this place is.
So can we have the lights back on please? Thank you.
Now, how do we know about an environment that's so far away and so different and so alien from anything we're used to?
Well, the Earth -- our environment, in the form of us -- is creating knowledge.
Well, what does that mean?
Well, look out even further than we've just been -- I mean from here, with a telescope -- and you'll see things that look like stars, they're called quasars.
"Quasars" originally meant "quasi-stellar object," which means "things that look a bit like stars."
(Laughter) But they're not stars.
And we know what they are.
Billions of years ago and billions of light-years away, the material at the center of a galaxy collapsed towards a supermassive black hole.
And then intense magnetic fields directed some of the energy of that gravitational collapse and some of the matter back out in the form of tremendous jets, which illuminated lobes with the brilliance of -- I think it's a trillion -- suns.
Now, the physics of the human brain could hardly be more unlike the physics of such a jet.
We couldn't survive for an instant in it.
Language breaks down when trying to describe what it would be like in one of those jets.
It would be a bit like experiencing a supernova explosion, but at point-blank range and for millions of years at a time.
(Laughter) And yet, that jet happened in precisely such a way that billions of years later, on the other side of the universe, some bit of chemical scum could accurately describe and model and predict and explain, above all -- there's your reference -- what was happening there, in reality.
The one physical system, the brain, contains an accurate working model of the other, the quasar.
Not just a superficial image of it, though it contains that as well, but an explanatory model, embodying the same mathematical relationships and the same causal structure.
Now, that is knowledge.
And if that weren't amazing enough, the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other is increasing with time.
That is the growth of knowledge.
So, the laws of physics have this special property, that physical objects as unlike each other as they could possibly be can, nevertheless, embody the same mathematical and causal structure and to do it more and more so over time.
So we are a chemical scum that is different.
This chemical scum has universality.
Its structure contains, with ever-increasing precision, the structure of everything.
This place, and not other places in the universe, is a hub which contains within itself the structural and causal essence of the whole of the rest of physical reality.
And so, far from being insignificant, the fact that the laws of physics allow this or even mandate that this can happen is one of the most important things about the physical world.
Now, how does the solar system -- our environment, in the form of us -- acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe?
Well, one thing that's true about Stephen Hawking's remark -- I mean, it is true, but it's the wrong emphasis -- one thing that's true about it is that it doesn't do it with any special physics, there's no special dispensation, no miracles involved.
It does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance.
One of them is matter, because the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing.
Information processing is computation, computation requires a computer, and there's no known way of making a computer without matter.
We also need energy to make the computer, and most important, to make the media, in effect, onto which we record the knowledge that we discover.
And then thirdly, less tangible but just as essential for the open-ended creation of knowledge, of explanations, is evidence.
Now, our environment is inundated with evidence.
We happened to get round to testing, let's say, Newton's law of gravity, about 300 years ago.
But the evidence that we used to do that was falling down on every square meter of the Earth for billions of years before that, and we'll continue to fall for billions of years afterwards.
And the same is true for all the other sciences.
As far as we know, evidence to discover the most fundamental truths of all the sciences is here just for the taking, on our planet.
Our location is saturated with evidence and also with matter and energy.
Out in intergalactic space, those three prerequisites for the open-ended creation of knowledge are at their lowest possible supply -- as I said, it's empty, it's cold and it's dark out there.
Or is it?
Now actually, that's just another parochial misconception.
(Laughter) Because imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space, the same size as our home, the solar system.
Now, that cube is very empty by human standards, but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter.
And a million tons is enough to make, say, a self-contained space station, on which there's a colony of scientists that are devoted to creating an open-ended stream of knowledge, and so on.
Now, it's way beyond present technology to even gather the hydrogen from intergalactic space and form it into other elements and so on.
But the thing is, in a comprehensible universe, if something isn't forbidden by the laws of physics, then what could possibly prevent us from doing it, other than knowing how?
In other words, it's a matter of knowledge, not resources.
If we could do that, we'd automatically have an energy supply, because this transmutation would be a fusion reactor.
And evidence?
Well, again, it's dark out there to human senses, but all you've got to do is take a telescope, even one of present-day design, look out, and you'll see the same galaxies as we do from here.
And with a more powerful telescope, you'll be able to see stars and planets in those galaxies, you'll be able to do astrophysics and learn the laws of physics.
And locally there, you could build particle accelerators and learn elementary particle physics and chemistry, and so on.
Probably the hardest science to do would be biology field trips -- (Laughter) because it would take several hundred million years to get to the nearest life-bearing planet and back.
But I have to tell you -- and sorry, Richard -- but I never did like biology field trips much -- (Laughter) and I think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million years.
(Laughter) So, in fact, intergalactic space does contain all the prerequisites for the open-ended creation of knowledge.
Any such cube anywhere in the universe could become the same kind of hub that we are, if the knowledge of how to do so were present there.
So, we're not in a uniquely hospitable place.
If intergalactic space is capable of creating an open-ended stream of explanations, then so is almost every other environment, so is the Earth.
So is a polluted Earth.
And the limiting factor, there and here, is not resources -- because they're plentiful -- but knowledge, which is scarce.
Now, this cosmic knowledge-based view may -- and, I think, ought to -- make us feel very special.
But it should also make us feel vulnerable, because it means that without the specific knowledge that's needed to survive the ongoing challenges of the universe, we won't survive them.
All it takes is for a supernova to go off a few light-years away, and we'll all be dead!
Martin Rees has recently written a book about our vulnerability to all sorts of things, from astrophysics, to scientific experiments gone wrong, and most importantly, to terrorism with weapons of mass destruction.
And he thinks that civilization has only a 50 percent chance of surviving this century.
I think he's going to talk about that later in the conference.
Now, I don't think that probability is the right category to discuss this issue in, but I do agree with him about this: we can survive and we can fail to survive.
But it depends, not on chance, but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time.
The danger is not at all unprecedented.
Species go extinct all the time.
Civilizations end.
The overwhelming majority of all species and all civilizations that have ever existed are now history.
And if we want to be the exception to that, then logically, our only hope is to make use of the one feature that distinguishes our species and civilization from all the others, namely, our special relationship with the laws of physics, our ability to create new explanations, new knowledge -- to be a hub of existence.
So let me now apply this to a current controversy, not because I want to advocate any particular solution, but just to illustrate the kind of thing I mean.
And the controversy is global warming.
Now, I'm a physicist, but I'm not the right kind of physicist.
In regard to global warming, I'm just a layman.
And the rational thing for a layman to do is to take seriously the prevailing scientific theory.
And according to that theory, it's already too late to avoid a disaster, because, if it's true that our best option at the moment is to prevent CO2 emissions with something like the Kyoto Protocol, with its constraints on economic activity and its enormous cost of hundreds of billions of dollars, or whatever it is, then that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure.
And the actions that are advocated are not even purported to solve the problem, merely to postpone it by a little.
So it's already too late to avoid it, and it probably has been too late to avoid it ever since before anyone realized the danger.
It was probably already too late in the 1970s, when the best available scientific theory was telling us that industrial emissions were about to precipitate a new ice age, in which billions would die.
Now, the lesson of that seems clear to me, and I don't know why it isn't informing public debate.
It is that we can't always know.
When we know of an impending disaster and how to solve it at a cost less than the cost of the disaster itself, then there's not going to be much argument, really.
But no precautions and no precautionary principle can avoid problems that we do not yet foresee.
Hence, we need a stance of problem-fixing, not just problem-avoidance.
And it's true that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure, but that's only if we know what to prevent.
If you've been punched on the nose, then the science of medicine does not consist of teaching you how to avoid punches.
(Laughter) If medical science stopped seeking cures and concentrated on prevention only, then it would achieve very little of either.
The world is buzzing at the moment with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs.
It ought to be buzzing with plans to reduce the temperature and with plans to live at the higher temperature -- and not at all costs, but efficiently and cheaply.
And some such plans exist, things like swarms of mirrors in space to deflect the sunlight away and encouraging aquatic organisms to eat more carbon dioxide.
At the moment, these things are fringe research; they're not central to the human effort to face this problem or problems in general.
And with problems that we are not aware of yet, the ability to put right -- not the sheer good luck of avoiding indefinitely -- is our only hope, not just of solving problems, but of survival.
So, take two stone tablets and carve on them.
On one of them, carve: "Problems are soluble."
And on the other one, carve: "Problems are inevitable."
Thank you.
(Applause)
Let's talk trash.
You know, we had to be taught to renounce the powerful conservation ethic we developed during the Great Depression and World War II.
After the war, we needed to direct our enormous production capacity toward creation of products for peacetime.
Life Magazine helped in this effort by announcing the introduction of throwaways that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes.
Mental note to the liberators: throwaway plastics take a lot of space and don't biodegrade.
Only we humans make waste that nature can't digest.
Plastics are also hard to recycle.
A teacher told me how to express the under-five-percent of plastics recovered in our waste stream.
It's diddly-point-squat.
That's the percentage we recycle.
Now, melting point has a lot to do with this.
Plastic is not purified by the re-melting process like glass and metal.
It begins to melt below the boiling point of water and does not drive off the oily contaminants for which it is a sponge.
Half of each year's 100 billion pounds of thermal plastic pellets will be made into fast-track trash.
A large, unruly fraction of our trash will flow downriver to the sea.
Here is the accumulation at Biona Creek next to the L.A. airport.
And here is the flotsam near California State University Long Beach and the diesel plant we visited yesterday.
In spite of deposit fees, much of this trash leading out to the sea will be plastic beverage bottles.
We use two million of them in the United States every five minutes, here imaged by TED presenter Chris Jordan, who artfully documents mass consumption and zooms in for more detail.
Here is a remote island repository for bottles off the coast of Baja California.
Isla San Roque is an uninhabited bird rookery off Baja's sparsely populated central coast.
Notice that the bottles here have caps on them.
Bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate, PET, will sink in seawater and not make it this far from civilization.
Also, the caps are produced in separate factories from a different plastic, polypropylene.
They will float in seawater, but unfortunately do not get recycled under the bottle bills.
Let's trace the journey of the millions of caps that make it to sea solo.
After a year the ones from Japan are heading straight across the Pacific, while ours get caught in the California current and first head down to the latitude of Cabo San Lucas.
After ten years, a lot of the Japanese caps are in what we call the Eastern Garbage Patch, while ours litter the Philippines.
After 20 years, we see emerging the debris accumulation zone of the North Pacific Gyre.
It so happens that millions of albatross nesting on Kure and Midway atolls in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands National Monument forage here and scavenge whatever they can find for regurgitation to their chicks.
A four-month old Laysan Albatross chick died with this in its stomach.
Hundreds of thousands of the goose-sized chicks are dying with stomachs full of bottle caps and other rubbish, like cigarette lighters ...
but, mostly bottle caps.
Sadly, their parents mistake bottle caps for food tossing about in the ocean surface.
The retainer rings for the caps also have consequences for aquatic animals.
This is Mae West, still alive at a zookeeper's home in New Orleans.
I wanted to see what my home town of Long Beach was contributing to the problem, so on Coastal Clean-Up Day in 2005 I went to the Long Beach Peninsula, at the east end of our long beach.
We cleaned up the swaths of beach shown.
I offered five cents each for bottle caps.
I got plenty of takers.
Here are the 1,100 bottle caps they collected.
I thought I would spend 20 bucks.
That day I ended up spending nearly 60.
I separated them by color and put them on display the next Earth Day at Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro.
Governor Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria stopped by to discuss the display.
In spite of my "girly man" hat, crocheted from plastic shopping bags, they shook my hand. (Laughter) I showed him and Maria a zooplankton trawl from the gyre north of Hawaii with more plastic than plankton.
Here's what our trawl samples from the plastic soup our ocean has become look like.
Trawling a zooplankton net on the surface for a mile produces samples like this.
And this.
Now, when the debris washes up on the beaches of Hawaii it looks like this.
And this particular beach is Kailua Beach, the beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving to Washington.
Now, how do we analyze samples like this one that contain more plastic than plankton?
We sort the plastic fragments into different size classes, from five millimeters to one-third of a millimeter.
Small bits of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutants up to a million times their levels in the surrounding seawater.
We wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean, at the base of the food chain, was ingesting these poison pills.
We did hundreds of necropsies, and over a third had polluted plastic fragments in their stomachs.
The record-holder, only two-and-a-half inches long, had 84 pieces in its tiny stomach.
Now, you can buy certified organic produce.
But no fishmonger on Earth can sell you a certified organic wild-caught fish.
This is the legacy we are leaving to future generations.
The throwaway society cannot be contained -- it has gone global.
We simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff.
We have to throw it away.
Now, the market can do a lot for us, but it can't fix the natural system in the ocean we've broken.
All the king's horses and all the king's men ...
will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again.
Narrator (Video): The levels are increasing, the amount of packaging is increasing, the "throwaway" concept of living is proliferating, and it's showing up in the ocean.
Anchor: He offers no hope of cleaning it up.
Straining the ocean for plastic would be beyond the budget of any country and it might kill untold amounts of sea life in the process.
The solution, Moore says, is to stop the plastic at its source: stop it on land before it falls in the ocean.
And in a plastic-wrapped and packaged world, he doesn't hold out much hope for that, either.
This is Brian Rooney for Nightline, in Long Beach, California.
Charles Moore: Thank you.
This is the first of two rather extraordinary photographs I'm going to show you today.
I was 19 years old at the time.
I had just returned from one of the deepest dives I'd ever made at that time -- a little over 200 feet.
And I had caught this little fish.
It turns out that particular one was the first of its kind ever taken alive.
And to a fish nerd, this is some pretty exciting stuff.
More exciting was the fact that the person who took this photo is a guy named Jack Randall, the greatest living ichthyologist on earth -- the Grand Poobah of fish nerds, if you will.
And so, it was really exciting to me to have this moment in time.
It set the course for the rest of my life.
But really, the most significant, most profound thing about this picture is it was taken two days before I was completely paralyzed from the neck down.
I made a really stupid kind of mistake that most 19-year-old males do when they think they're immortal, and I got a bad case of the bends and was paralyzed, and had to be flown back for treatment.
I learned two really important things that day.
The first thing I learned -- well, I'm mortal. That's a really big one.
And the second thing I learned was that I knew, with profound certainty, that this is exactly what I was going to do for the rest of my life.
I had to focus all my energies towards going to find new species of things down on deep coral reefs.
When you think of a coral reef, this is what most people think of: these big, hard, elaborate corals, lots of bright, colorful fishes and things.
But this is really just the tip of the iceberg.
If you look at this diagram of a coral reef, we know a lot about that part up near the top.
The reason we know so much about it is scuba divers can very easily go down there and access it.
There is a problem with scuba, though, in that it imposes some limitations on how deep you can go.
It turns out that depth is about 200 feet.
I'll get into why that is in just a minute, but the point is, scuba divers generally stay less than 100 feet deep, and very rarely go much below this, at least, not with any kind of sanity.
So to go deeper, most biologists have turned to submersibles.
Now, submersibles are great, wonderful things, but if you're going to spend 30,000 dollars a day to use one of these things and it's capable of going 2,000 feet, you're not going to go farting around up here in a couple of hundred feet, you're going to go way down deep.
So the bottom line is, almost all research using submersibles has taken place well below 500 feet.
Now, it's pretty obvious at this point there's a zone here in the middle.
That's the zone that centers around my own personal pursuit of happiness.
I want to find out what's in this zone; we know almost nothing about it.
Scuba divers can't get there, submarines go right on past it.
It took me a year to learn to walk again after my diving accident in Palau.
During that year, I spent a lot of time learning about the physics and physiology of diving and how to overcome these limitations.
I'm just going to show you a basic idea.
Air is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, 20 percent oxygen, 80 percent nitrogen.
It's in our lungs.
And there's a phenomenon called Henry's law, that says gases will dissolve into a fluid in proportion to the partial pressures you're exposing them to.
The oxygen is bound by metabolism, we use it for energy.
The nitrogen sort of floats around in our blood and tissues.
That's fine, it's how we're designed.
The problem happens when you go underwater.
If you were to go down to a depth of about 130 feet, which is the recommended limit for most scuba divers, you'd get this pressure effect.
The effect of that pressure is you have an increased density of gas molecules in every breath you take.
Over time, those gas molecules dissolve into your blood and tissues and start to fill you up.
Now, if you were to go down to, say, 300 feet, you don't have five times as many gas molecules in your lungs, you've got 10 times as many gas molecules in your lungs.
And if you were to go down to where there's 15 times as much -- the deeper you go, the more exacerbating the problem becomes.
The limitation of diving with air is all those dots in your body, all the nitrogen and all the oxygen.
There are three basic limitations of scuba diving.
The first limitation is the oxygen -- oxygen toxicity.
Now, we all know the song: "Love is like oxygen.
You get too much, you get too high. Not enough, and you're gonna die."
Well, in the context of diving, you get too much, you die also.
It makes you convulse underwater -- not a good thing to happen underwater.
It happens because there's too much concentration of oxygen in your body.
The nitrogen has two problems.
One of them is what Jacques Cousteau called "rapture of the deep."
It's nitrogen narcosis.
It makes you loopy; the deeper you go, the loopier you get.
You don't want to drive drunk, you don't want to dive drunk.
So that's a real big problem.
And of course, the third problem is the one I found out the hard way in Palau, which is the bends.
One thing I forgot to mention is that to obviate the problem of nitrogen narcosis -- all of those blue dots in our body -- you remove the nitrogen and replace it with helium.
Helium's a gas; there're a lot of reasons why helium's good, it's a tiny molecule, it's inert, it doesn't give you narcosis.
So that's the basic concept we use.
But the theory's relatively easy.
The tricky part is the implementation.
So this is how I began about 15 years ago.
I'll admit, it wasn't exactly the smartest of starts, but you've got to start somewhere.
(Laughter) At the time, I wasn't the only one who didn't know what I was doing.
Almost nobody did.
This rig was actually used for a dive of 300 feet.
But over time we got better at it, and we came up with this really sophisticated-looking rig with four scuba tanks, five regulators and all the right gas mixtures, all that good stuff.
It was fine and dandy, it allowed us to go down and find new species.
This picture was taken at 300 feet, catching new species of fish.
The problem was it didn't allow us much time.
For all its bulk and size, it only gave us about 15 minutes at most down at those sorts of depths.
We needed more time. There had to be a better way.
And indeed, there is a better way.
In 1994, I was fortunate enough to get access to these prototype closed-circuit rebreathers.
Closed-circuit rebreather: what makes it different from scuba, and why is it better?
Well, there are three main advantages to a rebreather.
One, they're quiet, they don't make any noise.
Two, they allow you to stay underwater longer.
Three, they allow you to go deeper.
In order to really understand how they do that, you have to look underneath the hood and see what's going on.
There are three basic systems to a closed-circuit rebreather.
The most fundamental is called the breathing loop.
It's a breathing loop because you breathe off of it; it's a closed loop, and you breathe the same gas around and around.
There's a mouthpiece that you put in your mouth, and there's a counter lung, or in this case, two counter lungs.
The counter lungs aren't high tech, they're simply flexible bags.
They allow you to mechanically breathe, mechanically ventilate.
When you exhale, it goes in the exhale counter lung; when you inhale, it comes from the inhale counter lung.
It's just pure mechanics, allowing you to cycle air through this breathing loop.
The other component on a breathing loop is the carbon-dioxide-absorbent canister.
Now, as we breathe, we produce carbon dioxide, and that carbon dioxide needs to be scrubbed out of the system.
There's a chemical filter in there that pulls the carbon dioxide out of the breathing gas, so that when it comes back to us, it's safe to breathe again.
That's the breathing loop in a nutshell.
The second main component of a closed-circuit rebreather is the gas system.
The primary purpose of the gas system is to provide oxygen, to replenish the oxygen that your body consumes.
So the main tank, the main critical thing, is this oxygen gas supply cylinder we have here.
But if we only had an oxygen gas supply cylinder, we wouldn't be able to go very deep, because we'd run into oxygen toxicity very quickly.
And that, fittingly enough, is called the diluent gas supply.
In our applications, we generally put air inside this diluent gas supply, because it's a very cheap and easy source of nitrogen.
So that's where we get our nitrogen from.
But if we want to go deeper, of course, we need another gas supply, and helium is what we really need to go deep.
Usually we'll have a slightly larger cylinder, mounted exterior on the rebreather, like this.
That's what we use to inject, as we start to do our deep dives.
We also have a second oxygen cylinder, solely as a backup; if there's a problem with our first oxygen supply, we can continue to breathe.
The way you manage all these different gases and different gas supplies is this really high-tech, sophisticated gas block up on the front here, where it's easy to reach.
It's got the valves and knobs and things you need to inject the right gases at the right time.
Normally, you don't have to do that, because all of it's done automatically with the electronics, the third system of a rebreather.
The most critical part of a rebreather are the oxygen sensors.
You need three, so if one goes bad, you know which one it is.
You also have three microprocessors.
Any one of those computers can run the entire system, so if you have to lose two of them, there's back-up power supplies.
And there are multiple displays, to get the information to the diver.
This is the high-tech gadgetry that allows us to do what we do on these deep dives.
I can talk about it all day -- just ask my wife -- but I want to move on to something much more interesting.
I'm going to take you on a deep dive, and show you what it's like to do one.
We start up on the boat, For all this high-tech, expensive equipment, this is still the best way to get in the water, just flop over the side of the boat.
Now, as I showed you in the earlier diagram, these reefs that we dive on start out near the surface and they go almost vertically, completely straight down.
So we drop in the water and go over the edge of this cliff, and then we start dropping, dropping, dropping.
People ask if it takes a long time to get there.
No; it only takes a couple minutes to get down to three or four hundred feet, which is what we're aiming for.
It's like skydiving in slow motion. It's really very interesting.
You ever see "The Abyss," where Ed Harris is sinking down along the side of the wall?
That's what it feels like. Amazing.
And down there, you find that the water is very clear, extremely clear, because there's hardly any plankton.
When you turn on your light and look around the caves, you're confronted with a tremendous amount of diversity, much more than anyone used to believe.
Now, not all of it is new species -- that fish you see with the white stripe, that's a known species.
But if you look carefully into the cracks and crevices, you'll see little things scurrying all over the place.
There's a just unbelievable diversity.
It's not just fish, either.
These are crinoids, sponges, black corals. There're some more fishes.
Those fishes that you see now are new species.
They're still new species, because I had a video camera instead of my net, so they're still waiting down there for someone to go find them.
But this is what it looks like.
And this kind of habitat just goes on and on and on for miles.
This is Papua, New Guinea.
Now little fishes and invertebrates aren't the only things we see down there.
We also see sharks, much more regularly than I would have expected to.
We're not quite sure why.
What I want you to do now is imagine yourself 400 feet underwater, with all this high-tech gear on your back, you're in a remote reef off Papua, New Guinea, thousands of miles from the nearest recompression chamber, and you're completely surrounded by sharks.
(Video) Diver 1: (In squeaky voice) Look at those ...
Diver 2: Uh, oh ...
Uh, oh!
Richard Pyle: When you start talking like Donald Duck, there's no situation in the world that can seem tense.
(Laughter) So we're down there -- this is at 400 feet.
That's looking straight up, by the way, to give a sense of how far the surface is.
And if you're a biologist and know about sharks, and you want to assess, how much jeopardy am I really in here, there's one question that sort of jumps to the forefront of your mind immediately, which is -- (Video) Diver 1: What kind of sharks?
Diver 2: Silvertip sharks.
Diver 1: Oh.
RP: There are actually three species of sharks here.
The silvertips are the ones with the white edges on the fins, and there're also gray reef sharks and hammerheads off in the distance.
And yes, it's a little nerve-racking.
(Video) Diver 2: Hoo!
Audience: (Laughter) Now, you've seen video like this on TV a lot, and it's very intimidating.
I think it gives the wrong impression about sharks; they're actually not very dangerous animals.
That's why we weren't worried much and were joking around.
More people are killed by pigs, by lightning strikes, more people are killed at soccer games in England.
There's a lot of other ways you can die.
And I'm not making that stuff up.
Coconuts! You can get killed by a coconut more likely than killed by a shark.
So sharks aren't quite as dangerous as most people make them out to be.
Now, I don't know if any of you get US News and World Report -- I got the recent issue.
There's a cover story about the great explorers of our time.
It questions whether or not there really are any new frontiers out there, whether there are any true, hardcore discoveries that can still be made.
My favorite line from the article: [... 'discovery' can mean finding a guppy with an extra spine in its dorsal fin."] I have to laugh; they don't call us fish nerds for nothing.
We actually do get excited about finding a new dorsal spine in a guppy.
But it's much more than that.
I want to show you a few of the guppies we've found over the years.
(Laughter) Even if you ignore the scientific value of this thing, look at the monetary value of this thing.
A couple of these were sold through the aquarium trade to Japan, where they sold for 15,000 dollars apiece.
That's half a million dollars a pound.
Here's another new angelfish we discovered.
This one we first discovered back in the air days -- the bad old air days, when we were doing these kind of dives with air.
We were at 360 feet.
I remember coming up from one of these deep dives and I had this fog, and the narcosis takes a little while to fade away, sort of like sobering up.
I had this vague recollection of seeing this yellow fish with a black spot, and thought, "Damn, I should have caught one -- I think that's a new species."
Sure enough, I had caught one, I just completely forgot.
That's its official scientific name, in reference to its deep-dwelling habits.
When we first found it, we weren't even sure what family it belonged to, so we just called it the Dr. Seuss fish, since it looked like something from one of those books.
Now, this one's pretty cool.
If you go to Papua, New Guinea and go down 300 feet, you'll see these big mounds.
This may be hard to see, but they're a couple meters in diameter.
If you look closely, you'll see there's a little white and gray fish that hangs out near them.
It turns out this little white fish builds these giant mounds, one pebble at a time.
It's extraordinary to find something like this.
It's not just new species, it's new behaviors, new ecology, all kind of new things.
What I'm going to show you now, quickly, is a sampling of the new species we've discovered.
What's extraordinary is not just the number of species we're finding -- though as you can see, that's pretty amazing; this is only half of what we've found -- what's extraordinary is how quickly we find them.
We're up to seven new species per hour of time we spend at that depth.
If you go to an Amazon jungle and fog a tree, you may get a lot of bugs, but for fishes, there's nowhere in the world you can get seven new species per hour of time.
Now, we've done some back-of-the-envelope calculations, and we're predicting there are probably about 2,000 to 2,500 new species in the Indo-Pacific alone.
There are only five to six thousand known species, so a very large percentage of what is out there isn't really known.
We thought we had a handle on all the reef fish diversity -- evidently not.
I'm going to just close on a very somber note.
This is the second extraordinary photograph I'm going to show you.
This was taken exactly 300 feet above my head.
The reason this photograph is extraordinary is because it captures a moment in the very last minute of a person's life.
When we recovered his body, we figured out what had gone wrong.
He had made a very simple mistake; he turned the wrong valve when he filled his cylinder.
he had 80 percent oxygen in his tank when he should have had 40.
He had an oxygen toxicity seizure and he drowned.
The reason I show this -- not to put a downer on everything -- but I just want to use it to key off my philosophy of life in general, which is that we all have two goals.
The first goal we share with every other living thing on this planet, which is to survive.
I call it perpetuation: the survival of the species and survival of ourselves, And those are both about perpetuating the genome.
The second goal, for those of us who have mastered the first goal -- call it spiritual fulfillment, call it financial success, you can call it any number of different things.
I call it seeking joy, this pursuit of happiness.
So, I guess my theme on this is this guy lived his life to the fullest, he absolutely did.
You have to balance those two goals.
If you live your whole life in fear -- I mean, life is a sexually transmitted disease with 100 percent mortality.
So you can't live your life in fear.
(Laughter) I thought that was an old one!
(Applause) But at the same time, you don't want to get so focused on rule number two, goal number two, that you neglect goal number one.
Because once you're dead, you really can't enjoy anything after that.
So I wish you all the best of luck in maintaining that balance in your future endeavors.
Thanks.
I was raised in Seoul, Korea, and moved to New York City in 1999 to attend college.
I was pre-med at the time, and I thought I would become a surgeon because I was interested in anatomy and dissecting animals really piqued my curiosity.
At the same time, I fell in love with New York City.
I started to realize that I could look at the whole city as a living organism.
I wanted to dissect it and look into its unseen layers.
And the way to it, for me, was through artistic means.
So, eventually I decided to pursue an MFA instead of an M.D.
and in grad school I became interested in creatures that dwell in the hidden corners of the city.
In New York City, rats are part of commuters' daily lives.
Most people ignore them or are frightened of them.
But I took a liking to them because they dwell on the fringes of society.
And even though they're used in labs to promote human lives, they're also considered pests.
I also started looking around in the city and trying to photograph them.
One day, in the subway, I was snapping pictures of the tracks hoping to catch a rat or two, and a man came up to me and said, "You can't take photographs here.
The MTA will confiscate your camera."
I was quite shocked by that, and thought to myself, "Well, OK then.
I'll follow the rats."
Then I started going into the tunnels, which made me realize that there's a whole new dimension to the city that I never saw before and most people don't get to see.
Around the same time, I met like-minded individuals who call themselves urban explorers, adventurers, spelunkers, guerrilla historians, etc.
I was welcomed into this loose, Internet-based network of people who regularly explore urban ruins such as abandoned subway stations, tunnels, sewers, aqueducts, factories, hospitals, shipyards and so on.
When I took photographs in these locations, I felt there was something missing in the pictures.
Simply documenting these soon-to-be-demolished structures wasn't enough for me.
So I wanted to create a fictional character or an animal that dwells in these underground spaces, and the simplest way to do it, at the time, was to model myself.
I decided against clothing because I wanted the figure to be without any cultural implications or time-specific elements.
I wanted a simple way to represent a living body inhabiting these decaying, derelict spaces.
This was taken in the Riviera Sugar Factory in Red Hook, Brooklyn.
It's now an empty, six-acre lot waiting for a shopping mall right across from the new Ikea.
I was very fond of this space because it's the first massive industrial complex I found on my own that is abandoned.
When I first went in, I was scared, because I heard dogs barking and I thought they were guard dogs.
But they happened to be wild dogs living there, and it was right by the water, so there were swans and ducks swimming around and trees growing everywhere and bees nesting in the sugar barrels.
The nature had really reclaimed the whole complex.
And, in a way, I wanted the human figure in the picture to become a part of that nature.
When I got comfortable in the space, it also felt like a big playground.
I would climb up the tanks and hop across exposed beams as if I went back in time and became a child again.
This was taken in the old Croton Aqueduct, which supplied fresh water to New York City for the first time.
The construction began in 1837.
It lasted about five years.
It got abandoned when the new Croton Aqueducts opened in 1890.
When you go into spaces like this, you're directly accessing the past, because they sit untouched for decades.
I love feeling the aura of a space that has so much history.
Instead of looking at reproductions of it at home, you're actually feeling the hand-laid bricks and shimmying up and down narrow cracks and getting wet and muddy and walking in a dark tunnel with a flashlight.
This is a tunnel underneath Riverside Park.
It was built in the 1930s by Robert Moses.
The murals were done by a graffiti artist to commemorate the hundreds of homeless people that got relocated from the tunnel in 1991 when the tunnel reopened for trains.
Walking in this tunnel is very peaceful.
There's nobody around you, and you hear the kids playing in the park above you, completely unaware of what's underneath.
When I was going out a lot to these places, I was feeling a lot of anxiety and isolation because I was in a solitary phase in my life, and I decided to title my series "Naked City Spleen," which references Charles Baudelaire.
"Naked City" is a nickname for New York, and "Spleen" embodies the melancholia and inertia that come from feeling alienated in an urban environment.
This is the same tunnel.
You see the sunbeams coming from the ventilation ducts and the train approaching.
This is a tunnel that's abandoned in Hell's Kitchen.
I was there alone, setting up, and a homeless man approached.
I was basically intruding in his living space.
I was really frightened at first, but I calmly explained to him that I was working on an art project and he didn't seem to mind and so I went ahead and put my camera on self-timer and ran back and forth.
And when I was done, he actually offered me his shirt to wipe off my feet and kindly walked me out.
It must have been a very unusual day for him.
(Laughter) One thing that struck me, after this incident, was that a space like that holds so many deleted memories of the city.
That homeless man, to me, really represented an element of the unconscious of the city.
He told me that he was abused above ground and was once in Riker's Island, and at last he found peace and quiet in that space.
The tunnel was once built for the prosperity of the city, but is now a sanctuary for outcasts, who are completely forgotten in the average urban dweller's everyday life.
This is underneath my alma mater, Columbia University.
The tunnels are famous for having been used during the development of the Manhattan Project.
This particular tunnel is interesting because it shows the original foundations of Bloomingdale Insane Asylum, which was demolished in 1890 when Columbia moved in.
This is the New York City Farm Colony, which was a poorhouse in Staten Island from the 1890s to the 1930s.
Most of my photos are set in places that have been abandoned for decades, but this is an exception.
This children's hospital was closed in 1997; it's located in Newark.
When I was there three years ago, the windows were broken and the walls were peeling, but everything was left there as it was.
You see the autopsy table, morgue trays, x-ray machines and even used utensils, which you see on the autopsy table.
After exploring recently-abandoned buildings, I felt that everything could fall into ruins very fast: your home, your office, a shopping mall, a church -- any man-made structures around you.
I was reminded of how fragile our sense of security is and how vulnerable people truly are.
I love to travel, and Berlin has become one of my favorite cities.
It's full of history, and also full of underground bunkers and ruins from the war.
This was taken under a homeless asylum built in 1885 to house 1,100 people.
I saw the structure while I was on the train, and I got off at the next station and met people there that gave me access to their catacomb-like basement, which was used for ammunition storage during the war and also, at some point, to hide groups of Jewish refugees.
This is the actual catacombs in Paris.
I explored there extensively in the off-limits areas and fell in love right away.
There are more than 185 miles of tunnels, and only about a mile is open to the public as a museum.
The first tunnels date back to 60 B.C.
They were consistently dug as limestone quarries and by the 18th century, the caving-in of some of these quarries posed safety threats, so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries and dug new observation tunnels in order to monitor and map the whole place.
As you can see, the system is very complex and vast.
It's very dangerous to get lost in there.
And at the same time, there was a problem in the city with overflowing cemeteries.
So the bones were moved from the cemeteries into the quarries, making them into the catacombs.
The remains of over six million people are housed in there, some over 1,300 years old.
This was taken under the Montparnasse Cemetery where most of the ossuaries are located.
There are also phone cables that were used in the '50s and many bunkers from the World War II era.
This is a German bunker.
Nearby there's a French bunker, and the whole tunnel system is so complex that the two parties never met.
The tunnels are famous for having been used by the Resistance, which Victor Hugo wrote about in "Les Miserables."
And I saw a lot of graffiti from the 1800s, like this one.
After exploring the underground of Paris, I decided to climb up, and I climbed a Gothic monument that's right in the middle of Paris.
This is the Tower of Saint Jacques.
It was built in the early 1500s.
I don't recommend sitting on a gargoyle in the middle of January, naked.
It was not very comfortable. (Laughter) And all this time, I never saw a single rat in any of these places, until recently, when I was in the London sewers.
This was probably the toughest place to explore.
I had to wear a gas mask because of the toxic fumes -- I guess, except for in this picture.
And when the tides of waste matter come in it sounds as if a whole storm is approaching you.
This is a still from a film I worked on recently, called "Blind Door."
I've become more interested in capturing movement and texture.
And the 16mm black-and-white film gave a different feel to it.
And this is the first theater project I worked on.
I adapted and produced "A Dream Play" by August Strindberg.
It was performed last September one time only in the Atlantic Avenue tunnel in Brooklyn, which is considered to be the oldest underground train tunnel in the world, built in 1844.
I've been leaning towards more collaborative projects like these, lately.
But whenever I get a chance I still work on my series.
The last place I visited was the Mayan ruins of Copan, Honduras.
This was taken inside an archaeological tunnel in the main temple.
I like doing more than just exploring these spaces.
I feel an obligation to animate and humanize these spaces continually in order to preserve their memories in a creative way -- before they're lost forever.
Thank you.
Four years ago, on the TED stage, I announced a company I was working with at the time called Odeo.
And because of that announcement, we got a big article in The New York Times, which led to more press, which led to more attention, and me deciding to become CEO of that company -- whereas I was just an adviser -- and raising a round of venture capital and ramping up hiring.
One of the guys I hired was an engineer named Jack Dorsey, and a year later, when we were trying to decide which way to go with Odeo, Jack presented an idea he'd been tinkering around with for a number of years that was based around sending simple status updates to friends.
We were also playing with SMS at the time at Odeo, so we kind of put two and two together, and in early 2006 we launched Twitter as a side project at Odeo.
Now, it's hard to justify doing a side project at a startup, where focus is so critical, but I had actually launched Blogger as a side project to my previous company, thinking it was just a little thing we'd do on the side, and it ended up taking over not only the company, but my life for the next five or six years.
So I learned to follow hunches even though you can't necessarily justify them or know where they're going to go.
And that's kind of what's happened with Twitter, time after time.
So, for those of you unfamiliar, Twitter is based around a very simple, seemingly trivial concept.
You say what you're doing in 140 characters or less, and people who are interested in you get those updates.
If they're really interested, they get the update as a text message on their cell phone.
So, for instance, I may Twitter right now that I'm giving a talk at TED.
And in my case, when I hit send, up to 60,000 people will receive that message in a matter of seconds.
Now, the fundamental idea is that Twitter lets people share moments of their lives whenever they want, be they momentous occasions or mundane ones.
It is by sharing these moments as they're happening that lets people feel more connected and in touch, despite distance, and in real time.
This is the primary use we saw of Twitter from the beginning, and what got us excited.
What we didn't anticipate was the many, many other uses that would evolve from this very simple system.
One of the things we realized was how important Twitter could be during real-time events.
When the wildfires broke out in San Diego, in October of 2007, people turned to Twitter to report what was happening and to find information from neighbors about what was happening around them.
But it wasn't just individuals.
The L.A. Times actually turned to Twitter to dispense information as well, and put a Twitter feed on the front page, and the L.A. Fire Department and Red Cross used it to dispense news and updates as well.
At this event, dozens of people here are Twittering and thousands of people around the world are following along because they want to know what it feels like to be here and what's happening.
Among the other interesting things that have cropped up are many things from businesses, from marketing and communications and predictable things, to an insanely popular Korean-barbecue taco truck that drives around L.A. and Twitters where it stops, causing a line to form around the block.
Politicians have recently begun Twittering.
In fact, there are 47 members of Congress who currently have Twitter accounts.
And they're tweeting, in some cases, from behind closed-door sessions with the President.
In this case, this guy's not liking what he's hearing.
The President himself is our most popular Twitter user, although his tweets have dropped off as of late, while Senator McCain's have picked up.
As have this guy's.
Twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium: you send one message and it goes out to everybody, and you receive the messages you're interested in.
One of the many ways that users shaped the evolution of Twitter was by inventing a way to reply to a specific person or a specific message.
So, this syntax, the "@username" that Shaquille O'Neal's using here to reply to one of his fans, was completely invented by users, and we didn't build it into the system until it already became popular and then we made it easier.
This is one of the many ways that users have shaped the system.
Another is via the API.
We built an application-programming interface, which basically means that programmers can write software that interacts with Twitter.
We currently know about over 2,000 pieces of software that can send Twitter updates -- interfaces for Mac, Windows, your iPhone, your BlackBerry -- as well as things like a device that lets an unborn baby Twitter when it kicks or a plant Twitter when it needs water.
Probably the most important third-party development came from a little company in Virginia called Summize.
Summize built a Twitter search engine.
And they tapped into the fact that, if you have millions of people around the world talking about what they're doing and what's around them, you have an incredible resource to find out about any topic or event while it's going on.
This really changed how we perceived Twitter.
For instance, here's what people are saying about TED.
This is another way that our mind was shifted, and Twitter wasn't what we thought it was.
We liked this so much we actually bought the company and are folding it into the main product.
This not only lets you view Twitters in different ways, but it introduces new use cases as well.
One of my favorites is what happened a few months ago when there was a gas shortage in Atlanta.
Some users figured out that they would Twitter when they found gas -- where it was, and how much it cost -- and then appended the keyword "#atlgas" which let other people search for that and find gas themselves.
And this trend of people using this communication network to help each other out goes far beyond the original idea of just keeping up with family and friends.
It's happened more and more lately, whether it's raising money for homeless people or to dig wells in Africa or for a family in crisis.
People have raised tens of thousands of dollars over Twitter in a matter of days on several occasions.
It seems like when you give people easier ways to share information, more good things happen.
I have no idea what will happen next with Twitter.
I've learned to follow the hunch, but never assume where it will go.
Thanks.
(Applause) Chris Anderson: We're not quite done yet.
So, look, if we could have this screen live.
This is actually the most terrifying thing that any speaker can do after they've been to an event.
It's totally intimidating.
So, this would be the Twitter search screen.
So we're going to just type a couple of random words into Twitter.
For example: "Evan Williams."
"Evan Williams, give people more good ways to share information and follow your hunch at TED."
"Currently listening to Evan Williams." "Currently listening to Evan Williams." "Evan Williams --" Oh.
"Evan Williams is just dying on stage here at TED.
Worst talk ever!" (Laughter) Evan Williams: Nice. Thanks.
CA: Just kidding.
But, literally in the eight minutes he was talking, there are about fifty tweets that already came on the talk.
So he'll see every aspect of the reaction: the fact that Barack Obama is the biggest Twitterer, the fact that it came out of TED.
I don't think there's any other way of getting instant feedback that way.
You have build something very fascinating, and it looks like its best times are still ahead of it.
So, thank you very much, Evan. EW: Thank you.
CA: That was very interesting.
Back in 1992, I started working for a company called Interval Research, which was just then being founded by David Lidell and Paul Allen as a for-profit research enterprise in Silicon Valley.
I met with David to talk about what I might do in his company.
I was just coming out of a failed virtual reality business and supporting myself by being on the speaking circuit and writing books -- after twenty years or so in the computer game industry having ideas that people didn't think they could sell.
And David and I discovered that we had a question in common, that we really wanted the answer to, and that was, "Why hasn't anybody built any computer games for little girls?"
Why is that?
It can't just be a giant sexist conspiracy.
These people aren't that smart.
There's six billion dollars on the table.
They would go for it if they could figure out how.
So, what is the deal here?
And as we thought about our goals -- I should say that Interval is really a humanistic institution, in the classical sense that humanism, at its best, finds a way to combine clear-eyed empirical research with a set of core values that fundamentally love and respect people.
The basic idea of humanism is the improvable quality of life; that we can do good things, that there are things worth doing because they're good things to do, and that clear-eyed empiricism can help us figure out how to do them.
So, contrary to popular belief, there is not a conflict of interest between empiricism and values.
And Interval Research is kind of the living example of how that can be true.
So David and I decided to go find out, through the best research we could muster, what it would take to get a little girl to put her hands on a computer, to achieve the level of comfort and ease with the technology that little boys have because they play video games.
We spent two and a half years conducting research; we spent another year and a half in advance development.
Then we formed a spin-off company.
In the research phase of the project at Interval, we partnered with a company called Cheskin Research, and these people -- Davis Masten and Christopher Ireland -- changed my mind entirely about what market research was and what it could be.
They taught me how to look and see, and they did not do the incredibly stupid thing of saying to a child, "Of all these things we already make you, which do you like best?" -- which gives you zero answers that are usable.
So, what we did for the first two and a half years was four things: We did an extensive review of the literature in related fields, like cognitive psychology, spatial cognition, gender studies, play theory, sociology, primatology.
Thank you Frans de Waal, wherever you are, I love you and I'd give anything to meet you.
After we had done that with a pretty large team of people and discovered what we thought the salient issues were with girls and boys and playing -- because, after all, that's really what this is about -- we moved to the second phase of our work, where we interviewed adult experts in academia, some of the people who'd produced the literature that we found relevant.
Also, we did focus groups with people who were on the ground with kids every day, like playground supervisors. We talked to them, confirmed some hypotheses and identified some serious questions about gender difference and play.
Then we did what I consider to be the heart of the work: interviewed 1,100 children, boys and girls, ages seven to 12, all over the United States -- except for Silicon Valley, Boston and Austin because we knew that their little families would have millions of computers in them and they wouldn't be a representative sample.
And at the end of those remarkable conversations with kids and their best friends across the United States, after two years, we pulled together some survey data from another 10,000 children, drew up a set up of what we thought were the key findings of our research, and spent another year transforming them into design heuristics, for designing computer-based products -- and, in fact, any kind of products -- for little girls, ages eight to 12.
And we spent that time designing interactive prototypes for computer software and testing them with little girls.
In 1996, in November, we formed the company Purple Moon which was a spinoff of Interval Research, and our chief investors were Interval Research, Vulcan Northwest, Institutional Venture Partners and Allen and Company.
We launched a website on September 2nd that has now served 25 million pages, and has 42,000 registered young girl users.
They visit an average of one and a half times a day, spend an average of 35 minutes a visit, and look at 50 pages a visit.
So we feel that we've formed a successful online community with girls.
We launched two titles in October -- "Rockett's New School" -- the first of a series of products -- is about a character called Rockett beginning her first day of school in eighth grade at a brand new place, with a blank slate, which allows girls to play with the question of, "What will I be like when I'm older?"
"What's it going to be like to be in high school or junior high school?
Who are my friends?"; to exercise the love of social complexity and the narrative intelligence that drives most of their play behavior; and which embeds in it values about noticing that we have lots of choices in our lives and the ways that we conduct ourselves.
The other title that we launched is called "Secret Paths in the Forest," which addresses the more fantasy-oriented, inner lives of girls.
These two titles both showed up in the top 50 entertainment titles in PC Data -- entertainment titles in PC Data in December, right up there with "John Madden Football," which thrills me to death.
So, we're real, and we've touched several hundreds of thousands of little girls.
We've made half-a-billion impressions with marketing and PR for this brand, Purple Moon.
Ninety-six percent of them, roughly, have been positive; four percent of them have been "other."
I want to talk about the other, because the politics of this enterprise, in a way, have been the most fascinating part of it, for me.
There are really two kinds of negative reviews that we've received.
One kind of reviewer is a male gamer who thinks he knows what games ought to be, and won't show the product to little girls.
The other kind of reviewer is a certain flavor of feminist who thinks they know what little girls ought to be.
And so it's funny to me that these interesting, odd bedfellows have one thing in common: they don't listen to little girls.
They haven't looked at children and they're certainly not demonstrating any love for them.
I'd like to play you some voices of little girls from the two-and-a-half years of research that we did -- actually, some of the voices are more recent.
And these voices will be accompanied by photographs that they took for us of their lives, of the things that they value and care about.
These are pictures the girls themselves never saw, but they gave to us This is the stuff those reviewers don't know about and aren't listening to and this is the kind of research I recommend to those who want to do humanistic work.
Girl 1: Yeah, my character is usually a tomboy.
Hers is more into boys.
Girl 2: Uh, yeah.
Girl 1: We have -- in the very beginning of the whole game, always we do this: we each have a piece of paper; we write down our name, our age -- are we rich, very rich, not rich, poor, medium, wealthy, boyfriends, dogs, pets -- what else -- sisters, brothers, and all those.
Girl 2: Divorced -- parents divorced, maybe.
Girl 3: This is my pretend [unclear] one.
Girl 4: We make a school newspaper on the computer.
Girl 5: For a girl's game also usually they'll have really pretty scenery with clouds and flowers.
Girl 6: Like, if you were a girl and you were really adventurous and a real big tomboy, you would think that girls' games were kinda sissy.
Girl 7: I run track, I played soccer, I play basketball, and I love a lot of things to do.
And sometimes I feel like I can't really enjoy myself unless it's like a vacation, like when I get Mondays and all those days off.
Girl 8: Well, sometimes there is a lot of stuff going on because I have music lessons and I'm on swim team -- all this different stuff that I have to do, and sometimes it gets overwhelming.
Girl 9: My friend Justine kinda took my friend Kelly, and now they're being mean to me.
Girl 10: Well, sometimes it gets annoying when your brothers and sisters, or brother or sister, when they copy you and you get your idea first and they take your idea and they do it themselves.
Girl 11: Because my older sister, she gets everything and, like, when I ask my mom for something, she'll say, "No" -- all the time.
But she gives my sister everything.
Brenda Laurel: I want to show you, real quickly, just a minute of "Rockett's Tricky Decision," which went gold two days ago.
Let's hope it's really stable.
This is the second day in Rockett's life.
The reason I'm showing you this is I'm hoping that the scene that I'm going to show you will look familiar and sound familiar, now that you've listened to some girls' voices.
And you can see how we've tried to incorporate the issues that matter to them in the game that we've created.
Miko: Hey Rockett! C'mere!
Rockett: Hi Miko! What's going on?
Miko: Did you hear about Nakilia's big Halloween party this weekend?
She asked me to make sure you knew about it.
Nakilia invited Reuben too, but -- Rockett: But what? Isn't he coming?
Miko: I don't think so.
I mean, I heard his band is playing at another party the same night.
Rockett: Really? What other party?
Girl: Max's party is going to be so cool, Whitney.
He's invited all the best people.
BL: I'm going to fast-forward to the decision point because I know I don't have a lot of time.
After this awful event occurs, Rocket gets to decide how she feels about it.
Rockett: Who'd want to show up at that party anyway?
I could get invited to that party any day if I wanted to.
Gee, I doubt I'll make Max's best people list.
BL: OK, so we're going to emotionally navigate.
If we were playing the game, that's what we'd do.
If at any time during the game we want to learn more about the characters, we can go into this hidden hallway, and I'll quickly just show you the interface.
We can, for example, go find Miko's locker and get some more information about her.
Oops, I turned the wrong way.
But you get the general idea of the product.
I wanted to show you the ways, innocuous as they seem, in which we're incorporating what we've learned about girls -- their desires to experience greater emotional flexibility, and to play around with the social complexity of their lives.
I want to make the point that what we're giving girls, I think, through this effort, is a kind of validation, a sense of being seen.
And a sense of the choices that are available in their lives.
We love them.
We see them.
We're not trying to tell them who they ought to be.
But we're really, really happy about who they are.
It turns out they're really great.
I want to close by showing you a videotape that's a version of a future game in the Rockett series that our graphic artists and design people put together, that we feel would please that four percent of reviewers.
"Rockett 28!"
Rockett: It's like I'm just waking up, you know?
BL: Thanks.
I was walking in the market one day with my wife, and somebody stuck a cage in my face.
And in between those slits were the saddest eyes I've ever seen.
There was a very sick orangutan baby, my first encounter.
That evening I came back to the market in the dark and I heard "uhh, uhh," and sure enough I found a dying orangutan baby on a garbage heap.
Of course, the cage was salvaged.
I took up the little baby, massaged her, forced her to drink until she finally started breathing normally.
This is Uce.
She's now living in the jungle of Sungai Wain, and this is Matahari, her second son, which, by the way, is also the son of the second orangutan I rescued, Dodoy.
That changed my life quite dramatically, and as of today, I have almost 1,000 babies in my two centers.
(Applause) No. No. No. Wrong.
It's horrible. It's a proof of our failing to save them in the wild.
It's not good.
This is merely proof of everyone failing to do the right thing.
Having more than all the orangutans in all the zoos in the world together, just now like victims for every baby, six have disappeared from the forest.
The deforestation, especially for oil palm, to provide biofuel for Western countries is what's causing these problems.
And those are the peat swamp forests on 20 meters of peat, the largest accumulation of organic material in the world.
When you open this for growing oil palms you're creating CO2 volcanoes that are emitting so much CO2 that my country is now the third largest emitter of greenhouse gasses in the world, after China and the United States.
And we don't have any industry at all -- it's only because of this deforestation.
And these are horrible images.
I'm not going to talk too long about it, but there are so many of the family of Uce, which are not so fortunate to live out there in the forest, that still have to go through that process.
And I don't know anymore where to put them.
So I decided that I had to come up with a solution for her but also a solution that will benefit the people that are trying to exploit those forests, to get their hands on the last timber and that are causing, in that way, the loss of habitat and all those victims.
So I created the place Samboja Lestari, and the idea was, if I can do this on the worst possible place that I can think of where there is really nothing left, no one will have an excuse to say, "Yeah, but ..."
No. Everyone should be able to follow this.
So we're in East Borneo. This is the place where I started.
As you can see there's only yellow terrain.
There's nothing left -- just a bit of grass there.
In 2002 we had about 50 percent of the people jobless there.
There was a huge amount of crime.
People spent so much of their money on health issues and drinking water.
There was no agricultural productivity left.
This was the poorest district in the whole province and it was a total extinction of wildlife.
This was like a biological desert.
When I stood there in the grass, it's hot -- not even the sound of insects -- just this waving grass.
Still, four years later we have created jobs for about 3,000 people.
The climate has changed. I will show you: no more flooding, no more fires.
It's no longer the poorest district, and there is a huge development of biodiversity.
We've got over 1,000 species. We have 137 bird species as of today.
We have 30 species of reptiles.
So what happened here? We created a huge economic failure in this forest.
So basically the whole process of destruction had gone a bit slower than what is happening now with the oil palm.
But we saw the same thing.
We had slash and burn agriculture; people cannot afford the fertilizer, so they burn the trees and have the minerals available there; the fires become more frequent, and after a while you're stuck with an area of land where there is no fertility left.
There are no trees left.
Still, in this place, in this grassland where you can see our very first office there on that hill, four years later, there is this one green blop on the Earth's surface ...
(Applause) And there are all these animals, and all these people happy, and there's this economic value.
So how's this possible?
It was quite simple. If you'll look at the steps: we bought the land, we dealt with the fire, and then only, we started doing the reforestation by combining agriculture with forestry.
Only then we set up the infrastructure and management and the monetary.
But we made sure that in every step of the way the local people were going to be fully involved so that no outside forces would be able to interfere with that.
The people would become the defenders of that forest.
So we do the "people, profit, planet" principles, but we do it in addition to a sure legal status -- because if the forest belongs to the state, people say, "It belongs to me, it belongs to everyone."
And then we apply all these other principles like transparency, professional management, measurable results, scalability, [unclear], etc.
What we did was we formulated recipes -- how to go from a starting situation where you have nothing to a target situation.
You formulate a recipe based upon the factors you can control, whether it be the skills or the fertilizer or the plant choice.
And then you look at the outputs and you start measuring what comes out.
Now in this recipe you also have the cost.
You also know how much labor is needed.
If you can drop this recipe on the map on a sandy soil, on a clay soil, on a steep slope, on flat soil, you put those different recipes; if you combine them, out of that comes a business plan, comes a work plan, and you can optimize it for the amount of labor you have available or for the amount of fertilizer you have, and you can do it.
This is how it looks like in practice. We have this grass we want to get rid of.
It exudes [unclear]-like compounds from the roots.
The acacia trees are of a very low value but we need them to restore the micro-climate, to protect the soil and to shake out the grasses.
And after eight years they might actually yield some timber -- that is, if you can preserve it in the right way, which we can do with bamboo peels.
It's an old temple-building technique from Japan but bamboo is very fire-susceptible.
So if we would plant that in the beginning we would have a very high risk of losing everything again.
So we plant it later, along the waterways to filter the water, provide the raw products just in time for when the timber becomes available.
So the idea is: how to integrate these flows in space, over time and with the limited means you have.
So we plant the trees, we plant these pineapples and beans and ginger in between, to reduce the competition for the trees, the crop fertilizer. Organic material is useful for the agricultural crops, for the people, but also helps the trees. The farmers have free land, the system yields early income, the orangutans get healthy food and we can speed up ecosystem regeneration while even saving some money.
So beautiful. What a theory.
But is it really that easy?
Not really, because if you looked at what happened in 1998, the fire started.
This is an area of about 50 million hectares.
January.
February.
March.
April.
May.
We lost 5.5 million hectares in just a matter of a few months.
This is because we have 10,000 of those underground fires that you also have in Pennsylvania here in the United States.
And once the soil gets dried, you're in a dry season -- you get cracks, oxygen goes in, flames come out and the problem starts all over again.
So how to break that cycle?
Fire is the biggest problem.
This is what it looked like for three months.
For three months, the automatic lights outside did not go off because it was that dark.
We lost all the crops. No children gained weight for over a year; they lost 12 IQ points. It was a disaster for orangutans and people.
So these fires are really the first things to work on.
That was why I put it as a single point up there.
And you need the local people for that because these grasslands, once they start burning ... It goes through it like a windstorm and you lose again the last bit of ash and nutrients to the first rainfall -- going to the sea killing off the coral reefs there.
So you have to do it with the local people.
That is the short-term solution but you also need a long-term solution.
So what we did is, we created a ring of sugar palms around the area.
These sugar palms turn out to be fire-resistant -- also flood-resistant, by the way -- and they provide a lot of income for local people.
This is what it looks like: the people have to tap them twice a day -- just a millimeter slice -- and the only thing you harvest is sugar water, carbon dioxide, rain fall and a little bit of sunshine.
In principle, you make those trees into biological photovoltaic cells.
And you can create so much energy from this -- they produce three times more energy per hectare per year, because you can tap them on a daily basis.
You don't need to harvest [unclear] or any other of the crops.
So this is the combination where we have all this genetic potential in the tropics, which is still unexploited, and doing it in combination with technology.
But also your legal side needs to be in very good order.
So we bought that land, and here is where we started our project -- in the middle of nowhere.
And if you zoom in a bit you can see that all of this area is divided into strips that go over different types of soil, and we were actually monitoring, measuring every single tree in these 2,000 hectares, 5,000 acres.
And this forest is quite different.
What I really did was I just followed nature, and nature doesn't know monocultures, but a natural forest is multilayered.
That means that both in the ground and above the ground it can make better use of the available light, it can store more carbon in the system, it can provide more functions.
But, it's more complicated. It's not that simple, and you have to work with the people.
So, just like nature, we also grow fast planting trees and underneath that, we grow the slower growing, primary-grain forest trees of a very high diversity that can optimally use that light. Then, what is just as important: get the right fungi in there that will grow into those leaves, bring back the nutrients to the roots of the trees that have just dropped that leaf within 24 hours.
And they become like nutrient pumps.
You need the bacteria to fix nitrogen, and without those microorganisms, you won't have any performance at all.
And then we started planting -- only 1,000 trees a day.
We could have planted many, many more, but we didn't want to because we wanted to keep the number of jobs stable.
We didn't want to lose the people that are going to work in that plantation.
And we do a lot of work here.
We use indicator plants to look at what soil types, or what vegetables will grow, or what trees will grow here.
And we have monitored every single one of those trees from space.
This is what it looks like in reality; you have this irregular ring around it, with strips of 100 meters wide, with sugar palms that can provide income for 648 families.
It's only a small part of the area.
The nursery, in here, is quite different.
If you look at the number of tree species we have in Europe, for instance, from the Urals up to England, you know how many?
165.
In this nursery, we're going to grow 10 times more than the number of species.
Can you imagine?
You do need to know what you are working with, but it's that diversity which makes it work.
That you can go from this zero situation, by planting the vegetables and the trees, or directly, the trees in the lines in that grass there, putting up the buffer zone, producing your compost, and then making sure that at every stage of that up growing forest there are crops that can be used.
In the beginning, maybe pineapples and beans and corn; in the second phase, there will be bananas and papayas; later on, there will be chocolate and chilies.
And then slowly, the trees start taking over, bringing in produce from the fruits, from the timber, from the fuel wood.
And finally, the sugar palm forest takes over and provides the people with permanent income.
On the top left, underneath those green stripes, you see some white dots -- those are actually individual pineapple plants that you can see from space.
And in that area we started growing some acacia trees that you just saw before.
So this is after one year.
And this is after two years.
And that's green. If you look from the tower -- this is when we start attacking the grass.
We plant in the seedlings mixed with the bananas, the papayas, all the crops for the local people, but the trees are growing up fast in between as well.
And three years later, 137 species of birds are living here.
(Applause) So we lowered air temperature three to five degrees Celsius.
Air humidity is up 10 percent.
Cloud cover -- I'm going to show it to you -- is up.
Rainfall is up.
And all these species and income.
This ecolodge that I built here, three years before, was an empty, yellow field.
This transponder that we operate with the European Space Agency -- it gives us the benefit that every satellite that comes over to calibrate itself is taking a picture.
Those pictures we use to analyze how much carbon, how the forest is developing, and we can monitor every tree using satellite images through our cooperation.
We can use these data now to provide other regions with recipes and the same technology.
We actually have it already with Google Earth.
If you would use a little bit of your technology to put tracking devices in trucks, and use Google Earth in combination with that, you could directly tell what palm oil has been sustainably produced, which company is stealing the timber, and you could save so much more carbon than with any measure of saving energy here.
So this is the Samboja Lestari area.
You measure how the trees grow back, but you can also measure the biodiversity coming back.
And biodiversity is an indicator of how much water can be balanced, how many medicines can be kept here.
And finally I made it into the rain machine because this forest is now creating its own rain.
This nearby city of Balikpapan has a big problem with water; it's 80 percent surrounded by seawater, and we have now a lot of intrusion there.
Now we looked at the clouds above this forest; we looked at the reforestation area, the semi-open area and the open area.
And look at these images.
I'll just run them very quickly through.
In the tropics, raindrops are not formed from ice crystals, which is the case in the temperate zones, you need the trees with [unclear], chemicals that come out of the leaves of the trees that initiate the raindrops.
So you create a cool place where clouds can accumulate, and you have the trees to initiate the rain.
And look, there's now 11.2 percent more clouds -- already, after three years.
If you look at rainfall, it was already up 20 percent at that time.
Let's look at the next year, and you can see that that trend is continuing.
Where at first we had a small cap of higher rainfall, that cap is now widening and getting higher.
And if we look at the rainfall pattern above Samboja Lestari, it used to be the driest place, but now you see consistently see a peak of rain forming there.
So you can actually change the climate.
When there are trade winds of course the effect disappears, but afterwards, as soon as the wind stabilizes, you see again that the rainfall peaks come back above this area.
So to say it is hopeless is not the right thing to do, because we actually can make that difference if you integrate the various technologies.
And it's nice to have the science, but it still depends mostly upon the people, on your education.
We have our farmer schools.
But the real success of course, is our band -- because if a baby is born, we will play, so everyone's our family and you don't make trouble with your family.
This is how it looks.
We have this road going around the area, which brings the people electricity and water from our own area.
We have the zone with the sugar palms, and then we have this fence with very thorny palms to keep the orangutans -- that we provide with a place to live in the middle -- and the people apart.
And inside, we have this area for reforestation as a gene bank to keep all that material alive, because for the last 12 years not a single seedling of the tropical hardwood trees has grown up because the climatic triggers have disappeared.
All the seeds get eaten.
So now we do the monitoring on the inside -- from towers, satellites, ultralights.
Each of the families that have sold their land now get a piece of land back.
And it has two nice fences of tropical hardwood trees -- you have the shade trees planted in year one, then you underplanted with the sugar palms, and you plant this thorny fence.
And after a few years, you can remove some of those shade trees.
The people get that acacia timber which we have preserved with the bamboo peel, and they can build a house, they have some fuel wood to cook with.
And they can start producing from the trees as many as they like.
They have enough income for three families.
But whatever you do in that program, it has to be fully supported by the people, meaning that you also have to adjust it to the local, cultural values.
There is no simple one recipe for one place.
You also have to make sure that it is very difficult to corrupt -- that it's transparent.
Like here, in Samboja Lestari, we divide that ring in groups of 20 families.
If one member trespasses the agreement, and does cut down trees, the other 19 members have to decide what's going to happen to him.
If the group doesn't take action, the other 33 groups have to decide what is going to happen to the group that doesn't comply with those great deals that we are offering them.
In North Sulawesi it is the cooperative -- they have a democratic culture there, so there you can use the local justice system to protect your system.
In summary, if you look at it, in year one the people can sell their land to get income, but they get jobs back in the construction and the reforestation, the working with the orangutans, and they can use the waste wood to make handicraft.
They also get free land in between the trees, where they can grow their crops.
They can now sell part of those fruits to the orangutan project.
They get building material for houses, a contract for selling the sugar, so we can produce huge amounts of ethanol and energy locally.
They get all these other benefits: environmentally, money, they get education -- it's a great deal.
And everything is based upon that one thing -- make sure that forest remains there.
So if we want to help the orangutans -- what I actually set out to do -- we must make sure that the local people are the ones that benefit.
Now I think the real key to doing it, to give a simple answer, is integration.
I hope -- if you want to know more, you can read more.
(Applause)
As an actor, I get scripts and it's my job to stay on script, to say my lines and bring to life a character that someone else wrote.
Over the course of my career, I've had the great honor playing some of the greatest male role models ever represented on television.
You might recognize me as "Male Escort #1."
(Laughter) "Photographer Date Rapist," "Shirtless Date Rapist" from the award-winning "Spring Break Shark Attack."
(Laughter) "Shirtless Medical Student," "Shirtless Steroid-Using Con Man" and, in my most well-known role, as Rafael.
(Applause) A brooding, reformed playboy who falls for, of all things, a virgin, and who is only occasionally shirtless.
(Laughter) Now, these roles don't represent the kind of man I am in my real life, but that's what I love about acting.
I get to live inside characters very different than myself.
But every time I got one of these roles, I was surprised, because most of the men I play ooze machismo, charisma and power, and when I look in the mirror, that's just not how I see myself.
But it was how Hollywood saw me, and over time, I noticed a parallel between the roles I would play as a man both on-screen and off.
I've been pretending to be a man that I'm not my entire life.
I've been pretending to be strong when I felt weak, confident when I felt insecure and tough when really I was hurting.
I think for the most part I've just been kind of putting on a show, but I'm tired of performing.
And I can tell you right now that it is exhausting trying to be man enough for everyone all the time.
Now -- right?
(Laughter) My brother heard that.
Now, for as long as I can remember, I've been told the kind of man that I should grow up to be.
As a boy, all I wanted was to be accepted and liked by the other boys, but that acceptance meant I had to acquire this almost disgusted view of the feminine, and since we were told that feminine is the opposite of masculine, I either had to reject embodying any of these qualities or face rejection myself.
This is the script that we've been given.
Right? Girls are weak, and boys are strong.
This is what's being subconsciously communicated to hundreds of millions of young boys and girls all over the world, just like it was with me.
Well, I came here today to say, as a man that this is wrong, this is toxic, and it has to end.
(Applause) Now, I'm not here to give a history lesson.
We likely all know how we got here, OK?
But I'm just a guy that woke up after 30 years and realized that I was living in a state of conflict, conflict with who I feel I am in my core and conflict with who the world tells me as a man I should be.
But I don't have a desire to fit into the current broken definition of masculinity, because I don't just want to be a good man.
I want to be a good human.
And I believe the only way that can happen is if men learn to not only embrace the qualities that we were told are feminine in ourselves but to be willing to stand up, to champion and learn from the women who embody them.
Now, men -- (Laughter) I am not saying that everything we have learned is toxic. OK?
I'm not saying there's anything inherently wrong with you or me, and men, I'm not saying we have to stop being men.
But we need balance, right?
We need balance, and the only way things will change is if we take a real honest look at the scripts that have been passed down to us from generation to generation and the roles that, as men, we choose to take on in our everyday lives.
So speaking of scripts, the first script I ever got came from my dad.
My dad is awesome.
He's loving, he's kind, he's sensitive, he's nurturing, he's here.
(Applause) He's crying.
(Laughter) But, sorry, Dad, as a kid I resented him for it, because I blamed him for making me soft, which wasn't welcomed in the small town in Oregon that we had moved to.
Because being soft meant that I was bullied.
See, my dad wasn't traditionally masculine, so he didn't teach me how to use my hands.
He didn't teach me how to hunt, how to fight, you know, man stuff.
Instead he taught me what he knew: that being a man was about sacrifice and doing whatever you can to take care of and provide for your family.
But there was another role I learned how to play from my dad, who, I discovered, learned it from his dad, a state senator who later in life had to work nights as a janitor to support his family, and he never told a soul.
That role was to suffer in secret.
And now three generations later, I find myself playing that role, too.
So why couldn't my grandfather just reach out to another man and ask for help?
Why does my dad to this day still think he's got to do it all on his own?
I know a man who would rather die than tell another man that they're hurting.
But it's not because we're just all, like, strong silent types.
It's not. A lot of us men are really good at making friends, and talking, just not about anything real.
(Laughter) If it's about work or sports or politics or women, we have no problem sharing our opinions, but if it's about our insecurities or our struggles, our fear of failure, then it's almost like we become paralyzed.
At least, I do.
So some of the ways that I have been practicing breaking free of this behavior are by creating experiences that force me to be vulnerable.
So if there's something I'm experiencing shame around in my life, I practice diving straight into it, no matter how scary it is -- and sometimes, even publicly.
Because then in doing so I take away its power, and my display of vulnerability can in some cases give other men permission to do the same.
As an example, a little while ago I was wrestling with an issue in my life that I knew I needed to talk to my guy friends about, but I was so paralyzed by fear that they would judge me and see me as weak and I would lose my standing as a leader that I knew I had to take them out of town on a three-day guys trip -- (Laughter) Just to open up. And guess what?
It wasn't until the end of the third day that I finally found the strength to talk to them about what I was going through.
But when I did, something amazing happened.
I realized that I wasn't alone, because my guys had also been struggling.
And as soon as I found the strength and the courage to share my shame, it was gone.
Now, I've learned over time that if I want to practice vulnerability, then I need to build myself a system of accountability.
So I've been really blessed as an actor.
I've built a really wonderful fan base, really, really sweet and engaged, and so I decided to use my social platform as kind of this Trojan horse wherein I could create a daily practice of authenticity and vulnerability.
The response has been incredible.
It's been affirming, it's been heartwarming.
I get tons of love and press and positive messages daily.
But it's all from a certain demographic: women.
(Laughter) This is real.
Why are only women following me?
Where are the men?
(Laughter) About a year ago, I posted this photo.
Now, afterwards, I was scrolling through some of the comments, and I noticed that one of my female fans had tagged her boyfriend in the picture, and her boyfriend responded by saying, "Please stop tagging me in gay shit.
Thx."
(Laughter) As if being gay makes you less of a man, right?
So I took a deep breath, and I responded.
I said, very politely, that I was just curious, because I'm on an exploration of masculinity, and I wanted to know why my love for my wife qualified as gay shit.
And then I said, honestly I just wanted to learn.
(Laughter) Now, he immediately wrote me back.
I thought he was going to go off on me, but instead he apologized.
He told me how, growing up, public displays of affection were looked down on.
He told me that he was wrestling and struggling with his ego, and how much he loved his girlfriend and how thankful he was for her patience.
And then a few weeks later, he messaged me again.
This time he sent me a photo of him on one knee proposing.
(Applause) And all he said was, "Thank you."
I've been this guy.
I get it.
See, publicly, he was just playing his role, rejecting the feminine, right?
But secretly he was waiting for permission to express himself, to be seen, to be heard, and all he needed was another man holding him accountable and creating a safe space for him to feel, and the transformation was instant.
I loved this experience, because it showed me that transformation is possible, even over direct messages.
So I wanted to figure out how I could reach more men, but of course none of them were following me.
(Laughter) So I tried an experiment.
I started posting more stereotypically masculine things -- (Laughter) Like my challenging workouts, my meal plans, my journey to heal my body after an injury.
And guess what happened?
Men started to write me.
And then, out of the blue, for the first time in my entire career, a male fitness magazine called me, and they said they wanted to honor me as one of their game-changers.
(Laughter) Was that really game-changing?
Or is it just conforming?
And see, that's the problem.
It's totally cool for men to follow me when I talk about guy stuff and I conform to gender norms.
But if I talk about how much I love my wife or my daughter or my 10-day-old son, how I believe that marriage is challenging but beautiful, or how as a man I struggle with body dysmorphia, or if I promote gender equality, then only the women show up.
Where are the men?
So men, men, men, men!
(Applause) I understand.
Growing up, we tend to challenge each other.
We've got to be the toughest, the strongest, the bravest men that we can be.
And for many of us, myself included, our identities are wrapped up in whether or not at the end of the day we feel like we're man enough.
But I've got a challenge for all the guys, because men love challenges.
(Laughter) I challenge you to see if you can use the same qualities that you feel make you a man to go deeper into yourself.
Your strength, your bravery, your toughness: Can we redefine what those mean and use them to explore our hearts?
Are you brave enough to be vulnerable?
To reach out to another man when you need help?
To dive headfirst into your shame?
Are you strong enough to be sensitive, to cry whether you are hurting or you're happy, even if it makes you look weak?
Are you confident enough to listen to the women in your life?
To hear their ideas and their solutions?
To hold their anguish and actually believe them, even if what they're saying is against you?
And will you be man enough to stand up to other men when you hear "locker room talk," when you hear stories of sexual harassment?
When you hear your boys talking about grabbing ass or getting her drunk, will you actually stand up and do something so that one day we don't have to live in a world where a woman has to risk everything and come forward to say the words "me too?"
(Applause) This is serious stuff.
I've had to take a real, honest look at the ways that I've unconsciously been hurting the women in my life, and it's ugly.
My wife told me that I had been acting in a certain way that hurt her and not correcting it.
Basically, sometimes when she would go to speak, at home or in public, I would just cut her off mid-sentence and finish her thought for her.
It's awful.
The worst part was that I was completely unaware when I was doing it.
It was unconscious.
So here I am doing my part, trying to be a feminist, amplifying the voices of women around the world, and yet at home, I am using my louder voice to silence the woman I love the most.
So I had to ask myself a tough question: am I man enough to just shut the hell up and listen?
(Laughter) (Applause) I've got to be honest. I wish that didn't get an applause.
(Laughter) Guys, this is real.
And I'm just scratching the surface here, because the deeper we go, the uglier it gets, I guarantee you.
I don't have time to get into porn and violence against women or the split of domestic duties or the gender pay gap.
But I believe that as men, it's time we start to see past our privilege and recognize that we are not just part of the problem.
Fellas, we are the problem.
The glass ceiling exists because we put it there, and if we want to be a part of the solution, then words are no longer enough.
There's a quote that I love that I grew up with from the Bahá'í writings.
It says that "the world of humanity is possessed of two wings, the male and the female.
So long as these two wings are not equivalent in strength, the bird will not fly."
So women, on behalf of men all over the world who feel similar to me, please forgive us for all the ways that we have not relied on your strength.
And now I would like to ask you to formally help us, because we cannot do this alone.
We are men. We're going to mess up.
We're going to say the wrong thing. We're going to be tone-deaf.
We're more than likely, probably, going to offend you.
But don't lose hope.
We're only here because of you, and like you, as men, we need to stand up and become your allies as you fight against pretty much everything.
We need your help in celebrating our vulnerability and being patient with us as we make this very, very long journey from our heads to our hearts.
And finally to parents: instead of teaching our children to be brave boys or pretty girls, can we maybe just teach them how to be good humans?
So back to my dad.
Growing up, yeah, like every boy, I had my fair share of issues, but now I realize that it was even thanks to his sensitivity and emotional intelligence that I am able to stand here right now talking to you in the first place.
The resentment I had for my dad I now realize had nothing to do with him.
It had everything to do with me and my longing to be accepted and to play a role that was never meant for me.
So while my dad may have not taught me how to use my hands, he did teach me how to use my heart, and to me that makes him more a man than anything.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Trees are wonderful arenas for discovery because of their tall stature, their complex structure, the biodiversity they foster and their quiet beauty.
I used to climb trees for fun all the time and now, as a grown-up, I have made my profession understanding trees and forests, through the medium of science.
The most mysterious part of forests is the upper tree canopy.
