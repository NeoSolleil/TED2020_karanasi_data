(Laughter) "It's going places.
(Laughter) I was in Sainsbury's the other day and there were like 30 different varieties.
Also you can cut up carrots, and you can dip them.
Have you ever done that, Solomon?"
(Laughter) He said, "I have to go bed now."
(Laughter) (Applause) "Till morrow.
Have sweet dream."
I didn't know what to say!
I said, "Bonsoir my golden nugget, bonsoir."
(Laughter) Guys, you have to understand, this had been going for, like, weeks, albeit hitherto the greatest weeks of my life, but I had to knock it on the head.
It was getting a bit out of hand.
Friends were saying, "James, do you want to come for a drink?"
I was like, "I can't, I'm expecting an email about some gold."
So I figured I had to knock it on the head.
I had to take it to a ridiculous conclusion.
When we email each other, we need to use a code."
And he agreed.
(Laughter) I said, "Solomon, I spent all night coming up with this code we need to use in all further correspondence: Lawyer: Gummy Bear.
Bank: Cream Egg.
Legal: Fizzy Cola Bottle. Claim: Peanut M&amp;Ms.
Documents: Jelly Beans.
Western Union: A Giant Gummy Lizard."
(Laughter) I knew these were all words they use, right?
I said, "Please call me Kitkat in all further correspondence."
(Laughter) I didn't hear back. I thought, I've gone too far.
I've gone too far. So I had to backpedal a little.
I said, "Solomon, Is the deal still on?
KitKat."
(Laughter) Because you have to be consistent.
Then I did get an email back from him.
He said, "The Business is on and I am trying to blah blah blah ..."
What followed is the greatest email I've ever received.
(Laughter) I'm not joking, this is what turned up in my inbox.
This was a good day.
"The business is on.
I am trying to raise the balance for the Gummy Bear -- (Laughter) so he can submit all the needed Fizzy Cola Bottle Jelly Beans to the Creme Egg, for the Peanut M&amp;Ms process to start.
(Laughter) Send 1,500 pounds via a Giant Gummy Lizard."
(Applause) And that was so much fun, right, that it got me thinking: like, what would happen if I just spent as much time as could replying to as many scam emails as I could?
And that's what I've been doing for three years on your behalf.
(Laughter) (Applause) Crazy stuff happens when you start replying to scam emails.
It's really difficult, and I highly recommend we do it.
There are a lot of people who do mean things to scammers.
All I'm doing is wasting their time.
And I think any time they're spending with me is time they're not spending scamming vulnerable adults out of their savings, right?
And if you're going to do this -- and I highly recommend you do -- get yourself a pseudonymous email address.
Don't use your own email address.
That's what I was doing at the start and it was a nightmare.
I'd wake up in the morning and have a thousand emails about penis enlargements, only one of which was a legitimate response -- (Laughter) to a medical question I had.
But I'll tell you what, though, guys, I'll tell you what: any day is a good day, any day is a good day if you receive an email that begins like this: (Laughter) "I AM WINNIE MANDELA, THE SECOND WIFE OF NELSON MANDELA THE FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT."
I was like, oh! -- that Winnie Mandela.
(Laughter) I know so many.
"I NEED TO TRANSFER 45 MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF MY HUSBAND NELSON MANDELA'S HEALTH CONDITION."
Let that sink in.
She sent me this, which is hysterical.
(Laughter) And this.
And this looks fairly legitimate, this is a letter of authorization.
But to be honest, if there's nothing written on it, it's just a shape!
(Laughter) I said, "Winnie, I'm really sorry to hear of this.
Given that Nelson died three months ago, I'd describe his health condition as fairly serious."
(Laughter) That's the worst health condition you can have, not being alive.
She said, "KINDLY COMPLY WITH MY BANKERS INSTRUCTIONS.
ONE LOVE."
(Laughter) I said, "Of course. NO WOMAN, NO CRY."
(Laughter) (Applause) She said, "MY BANKER WILL NEED TRANSFER OF 3000 DOLLARS. ONE LOVE."
(Laughter) I said, "no problemo.
I SHOT THE SHERIFF."
[ (BUT I DID NOT SHOOT THE DEPUTY) ] (Laughter) Thank you.
(Applause)
French fries are delicious.
French fries with ketchup are a little slice of heaven.
The problem is it's basically impossible to pour the exactly right amount.
We're so used to pouring ketchup that we don't realize how weird its behavior is.
Imagine a ketchup bottle filled with a straight up solid like steel.
No amount of shaking would ever get the steel out.
Now imagine that same bottle full of a liquid like water.
That would pour like a dream.
Ketchup, though, can't seem to make up its mind.
Is it is a solid? Or a liquid?
The answer is, it depends.
The world's most common fluids like water, oils and alcohols respond to force linearly.
If you push on them twice as hard, they move twice as fast.
Sir Isaac Newton, of apple fame, first proposed this relationship, and so those fluids are called Newtonian fluids.
Ketchup, though, is part of a merry band of linear rule breakers called Non-Newtonian fluids.
Mayonnaise, toothpaste, blood, paint, peanut butter and lots of other fluids respond to force non-linearly.
That is, their apparent thickness changes depending on how hard you push, or how long, or how fast.
And ketchup is actually Non-Newtonian in two different ways.
Way number one: the harder you push, the thinner ketchup seems to get.
Below a certain pushing force, ketchup basically behaves like a solid.
But once you pass that breaking point, it switches gears and becomes a thousand times thinner than it was before.
Sound familiar right?
Way number two: if you push with a force below the threshold force eventually, the ketchup will start to flow.
In this case, time, not force, is the key to releasing ketchup from its glassy prison.
Alright, so, why does ketchup act all weird?
Well, it's made from tomatoes, pulverized, smashed, thrashed, utterly destroyed tomatoes.
See these tiny particles?
This is what remains of tomatoes cells after they go through the ketchup treatment.
And the liquid around those particles?
That's mostly water and some vinegar, sugar, and spices.
When ketchup is just sitting around, the tomato particles are evenly and randomly distributed.
Now, let's say you apply a weak force very quickly.
The particles bump into each other, but can't get out of each other's way, so the ketchup doesn't flow.
Now, let's say you apply a strong force very quickly.
That extra force is enough to squish the tomato particles, so maybe instead of little spheres, they get smushed into little ellipses, and boom!
Now you have enough space for one group of particles to get passed others and the ketchup flows.
Now let's say you apply a very weak force but for a very long time.
Turns out, we're not exactly sure what happens in this scenario.
One possibility is that the tomato particles near the walls of the container slowly get bumped towards the middle, leaving the soup they were dissolved in, which remember is basically water, near the edges.
That water serves as a lubricant betwen the glass bottle and the center plug of ketchup, and so the ketchup flows.
Another possibility is that the particles slowly rearrange themselves into lots of small groups, which then flow past each other.
Scientists who study fluid flows are still actively researching how ketchup and its merry friends work.
Ketchup basically gets thinner the harder you push, but other substances, like oobleck or some natural peanut butters, actually get thicker the harder you push.
Others can climb up rotating rods, or continue to pour themselves out of a beeker, once you get them started.
From a physics perspective, though, ketchup is one of the more complicated mixtures out there.
And as if that weren't enough, the balance of ingredients and the presence of natural thickeners like xanthan gum, which is also found in many fruit drinks and milkshakes, can mean that two different ketchups can behave completely differently.
But most will show two telltale properties: sudden thinning at a threshold force, and more gradual thinning after a small force is applied for a long time.
And that means you could get ketchup out of the bottle in two ways: either give it a series of long, slow languid shakes making sure you don't ever stop applying force, or you could hit the bottle once very, very hard.
What the real pros do is keep the lid on, give the bottle a few short, sharp shakes to wake up all those tomato particles, and then take the lid off and do a nice controlled pour onto their heavenly fries.
I have been a police officer for a very, very long time.
And you see these notes in my hand because I'm also a black preacher.
(Laughter) And if you know anything about black preachers, we'll close, and then we'll keep going for another 20 minutes.
(Laughter) So I need this to keep pushing this thing forward.
I've been a police officer for a very long time, and I mean I predated technology.
I'm talking about before pagers.
(Laughter) Laugh if you want to, but I'm telling the truth.
I predate War on Our Fellow Man -- I mean, War on Drugs.
I predate all of that.
I predate so much and I've been through ebbs and flows and I've been through good and bad times, and still I absolutely love being a police officer.
I love being a police officer because it's always been a calling for me and never a job.
And even with that, my personal truth is that law enforcement is in a crisis.
It's an invisible crisis, and it has been for many, many years.
Even though we in law enforcement say, "You know what? We can't arrest our way out of this."
We say in law enforcement things like, "Yeah, it's illegal to profile."
You know what?
In law enforcement, we even agree that we have to adopt this thinking and become more oriented to community policing.
And yet all the while, still, we continue in the same vein, the same vein that contradicts everything that we just admitted.
And so that's the reason for me, several years ago.
Because I was tired of the racism, I was tired of discrimination, I was tired of the "-isms" and the schisms.
I was just so tired.
I was tired of the vicious cycle, and I was tired of it even in the beloved agency in the department that I still love today.
And so my wife and I, we sat down and we decided and we targeted a date that we would retire.
We would retire and I would go off into the sunset, maybe do ministry full time, love my wife a long time.
Y'all know what I'm talking about.
(Laughter) But we decided that I would retire.
But then there was a higher power than I.
There was a love for the city that I loved, that I grew up in, that I was educated in -- a city that pulled my heart back into the system.
So we didn't retire.
We didn't retire and so what happened was, over the next -- I would say, 18 months, 19 months, I had this passion to implement some radical policing.
And so now, over the next 19 months, I shifted, and I transcended from being a drug sergeant -- ready to retire as a drug sergeant -- and went from level to level to level, until I find myself as a district commander, commander of the worst district in Baltimore city.
We call it the Eastern District, the most violent district, the most impoverished district -- 46 percent unemployment in that district.
National rating at that time, national rating, the AIDS and the tuberculosis [rating], was always on the top 10 list for zip codes for cities across the nation, or just zip codes across the nation.
The top 10 -- I didn't say state, I didn't say city -- that little neighborhood.
And I said, you know what? We gotta do something different.
We gotta do something different. We gotta think radical.
We gotta think outside the box.
And so in order to bring change that I desperately wanted and I desperately felt in my heart, I had to start listening to that inner spirit.
I had to start listening to that man on the inside that went against everything that I had been trained to do.
But we still did it.
We still did it because we listened to that inner spirit, because I realized this: if I was to see real police reform in the communities that I had authority over for public safety, we had to change our stinkin' thinkin'.
We had to change it.
And so what we did is we started to think holistically and not paramilitarily.
So we thought differently.
And we started to realize that it could never be and never should have been us versus them.
And so I decided to come to that intersection where I could meet all classes, all races, all creeds, all colors; where I would meet the businesses and the faith-based, and the eds, the meds, and I would meet all the people that made up the communities that I had authority over.
So I met them and I began to listen.
See, police have a problem.
Off the top, we want to bring things into the community and come up with these extravagant strategies and deployments, but we never talk to the community about them.
And we shove them into the community and say, "Take that."
But we said we'd get rid of that stinkin' thinkin', so we talked to our communities.
We said, "This is your community table.
We'll pull up a chair. We want to hear from you.
What's going to work in your community?"
And then some great things started to happen.
See, here's the thing: I had to figure out a way to shift 130 cops that were under my tutelage from being occupiers of communities to being partners.
I had to figure out how to do that.
Because here's the crazy thing: in law enforcement, we have evolved into something incredible.
Listen, we have become great protectors.
We know how to protect you.
But we have exercised that arm so much, so very much.
If I was a natural police department and I represented a police department, you would see this incredible, beautiful, 23-inch arm.
(Laughter) It's pretty, ain't it? It's cut up.
No fat on it. Mmm it look good. It just look good!
(Laughter) That's a great arm -- protection!
That's who we are, but we've exercised it so much sometimes that it has led to abuse.
It's led to coldness and callousness and dehumanized us.
And we've forgotten the mantra across this nation is to protect and serve.
Y'all don't know that? Protect and serve.
(Laughter) So you look at the other arm, and then you look at it and ... there it is.
(Laughter) You know, it's kinda weak.
It looks sickly.
It's withering and it's dying because we've invested so much in our protective arm.
But we forgot to treat our communities like they're our customers; like they're our sons and daughters, our brothers and sisters, our mothers and fathers.
And so somehow, along the way, we've gotten out of balance.
And because we are a proud profession, it is very hard for us to look in the mirror and see our mistakes.
It's even harder to make a change.
And so, as I try to hurry and get through this, I need to say this: it's not just law enforcement, though.
Because every one of us makes up a community.
Everybody makes up a community.
And as communities -- can I say this? -- we have put too much responsibility on law enforcement.
Too much.
(Applause) And then we have the audacity and the nerve to get upset with law enforcement when we take action.
There is no way in the world that we, as a community, should be calling the police for kids playing ball in the street.
No way in the world that we should be calling the police because my neighbor's music is up too loud, because his dog came over to my yard and did a number two; there's no way we should be calling the police.
But we have surrendered so much of our responsibility.
Listen, when I was a little boy coming up in Baltimore -- and listen, we played rough in the street -- I ain't never see the police come and break us up.
You know who came? It was the elders.
It was the parental figures in the community.
It was those guardians, it was that village mentality.
They came and said, "Stop that!" and "Do this." and "Stop that."
We had mentors throughout all of the community.
So it takes all of us, all of us.
And when I say community, I'm talking about everything that makes up a community, even -- listen, because I'm a preacher, I'm very hard on the churches, because I believe the churches too often have become MIA, missing in action.
I believe they have shifted over the last 10, 20 years from being community churches, where you walk outside your door, round the corner and you're in church.
They shifted from that and became commuter churches.
So you now have churches who have become disconnected by default from the very community where they're planted.
And they don't take care of that community.
I could go on and on, but I really need to wrap this up.
Community and policing: we've all lost that precious gift, and I call it relational equity.
We've lost it with one another.
It's not somebody else's fault -- it's all of our fault.
We all take responsibility in this.
But I say this: it's not too late for all of us to build our cities and nation to make it great again.
It is never too late.
You see, after three years of my four-and-a-half-year commandship in that district, three years in, after putting pastors in the car with my police because I knew this -- it's a little secret -- I knew this: it was hard to stay a nasty police officer while you're riding around with a clergy.
(Laughter) (Applause) You'd be getting in and out of the car, looking to your right, talking about: "Father, forgive me, for I have sinned," all day long -- you can't do it!
So we came up with some incredible initiatives, engagements for our community and police to build that trust back.
We began to deal with our youth and with those who we consider are on the wrong side of the fence.
We knew we had an economic problem, so we began to create jobs.
We knew there was sickness in our community and they didn't have access to proper medical care, so we'd partner up.
We got to that intersection and partnered up with anybody that wanted to partner with us and talked about what we needed holistically, never thinking about the crime.
Because at the end of the day, if we took care of the needs of the people, if we got to the root cause, the crime would take care of itself.
It would take care of itself.
(Applause) And so, after three years of a four-and-a-half-year stint, we looked back and we looked over and found out that we were at a 40-year historical low: our crime numbers, our homicides -- everything had dropped down, back to the 1970s.
And it might go back further, but the problem is, we only started keeping data since 1970.
Forty-year crime low, so much so, I had other commanders call me, "Hey Mel, whatcha doin', man?
Whatcha doin'? We gotta get some of that!"
(Laughter) And so we gave them some of that.
And in a short period of time, the city went to a 30-year crime low.
For the first time in 30 years, we fell, Baltimore city, to under 200 homicides -- 197 to be exact.
And we celebrated, because we had learned to become great servers, become great servers first.
But I gotta tell you this: these last few years, as much as we had learned to become great proactive police officers and great relational police officers rather than reactive, these last years have disappointed me.
They have broken my heart.
The uprising still hurts.
It still hurts my heart, because truly I believe that it should've never happened.
I believe it should've never happened if we were allowed to continue along the vein that we were in, servicing our community, treating them like human beings, treating them with respect, loving on them first.
If we continued in that vein, it would've never happened.
But somehow, we went back to business as usual.
But I'm excited again!
I'm excited again, because now we have a police commissioner who not only talks about community policing, but he absolutely understands it, and more importantly, he embraces it.
So I'm very excited now.
Listen, I'm excited about Baltimore today, because we, as many cities, I believe shall rise from the ashes.
I believe -- I truly believe -- (Applause) that we will be great again.
I believe, as we continue to wrap arms and continue to say, "We're in this together," because it's not just an intersection: once we meet, we now gotta get on the same path for the same goals, and this city will become great again.
This nation will become great again.
Because we have the same goal: we all want peace.
We all want respect for one another.
We all want love.
And I believe we are back on that road, and I'm so excited about it.
So listen, I thank you for giving me a few minutes of your time.
God bless you all.
(Applause) God bless you.
(Applause)
In 479 BC, when Persian soldiers besieged the Greek city of Potidaea, the tide retreated much farther than usual, leaving a convenient invasion route.
But this wasn't a stroke of luck.
Before they had crossed halfway, the water returned in a wave higher than anyone had ever seen, drowning the attackers.
The Potiidaeans believed they had been saved by the wrath of Poseidon.
But what really saved them was likely the same phenomenon that has destroyed countless others: a tsunami.
Although tsunamis are commonly known as tidal waves, they're actually unrelated to the tidal activity caused by the gravitational forces of the Sun and Moon.
In many ways, tsunamis are just larger versions of regular waves.
They have a trough and a crest, and consist not of moving water, but the movement of energy through water.
The difference is in where this energy comes from.
For normal ocean waves, it comes from wind.
Because this only affects the surface, the waves are limited in size and speed.
But tsunamis are caused by energy originating underwater, from a volcanic eruption, a submarine landslide, or most commonly, an earthquake on the ocean floor caused when the tectonic plates of the Earth's surface slip, releasing a massive amount of energy into the water.
This energy travels up to the surface, displacing water and raising it above the normal sea level, but gravity pulls it back down, which makes the energy ripple outwards horizontally.
Thus, the tsunami is born, moving at over 500 miles per hour.
When it's far from shore, a tsunami can be barely detectable since it moves through the entire depth of the water.
But when it reaches shallow water, something called wave shoaling occurs.
Because there is less water to move through, this still massive amount of energy is compressed.
The wave's speed slows down, while its height rises to as much as 100 feet.
The word tsunami, Japanese for "harbor wave," comes from the fact that it only seems to appear near the coast.
If the trough of a tsunami reaches shore first, the water will withdraw farther than normal before the wave hits, which can be misleadingly dangerous.
A tsunami will not only drown people near the coast, but level buildings and trees for a mile inland or more, especially in low-lying areas.
As if that weren't enough, the water then retreats, dragging with it the newly created debris, and anything, or anyone, unfortunate enough to be caught in its path.
The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was one of the deadliest natural disasters in history, killing over 200,000 people throughout South Asia.
So how can we protect ourselves against this destructive force of nature?
People in some areas have attempted to stop tsunamis with sea walls, flood gates, and channels to divert the water.
But these are not always effective.
In 2011, a tsunami surpassed the flood wall protecting Japan's Fukushima Power Plant, causing a nuclear disaster in addition to claiming over 18,000 lives.
Many scientists and policy makers are instead focusing on early detection, monitoring underwater pressure and seismic activity, and establishing global communication networks for quickly distributing alerts.
When nature is too powerful to stop, the safest course is to get out of its way.
Studies have shown that taking vitamins is good for your health and bad for your health.
That newly discovered herb can improve your memory or destroy your liver.
Headlines proclaim a promising new cancer treatment and never mention it again.
On a daily basis, we are bombarded with attention-grabbing news, backed up by scientific studies, but what are these studies?
How are they performed?
And how do we know whether they're reliable?
When it comes to dietary or medical information, the first thing to remember is that while studies on animals or individual cells can point the way towards further research, the only way to know how something will affect humans is through a study involving human subjects.
And when it comes to human studies, the scientific gold standard is the randomized clinical trial, or RCT.
The key to RCTs is that the subjects are randomly assigned to their study groups.
They are often blinded to make them more rigorous.
This process attempts to ensure that the only difference between the groups is the one the researchers are attempting to study.
For example, when testing a new headache medication, a large pool of people with headaches would be randomly divided into two groups, one receiving the medication and another receiving a placebo.
With proper randomization, the only significant overall difference between the two groups will be whether or not they received the medication, rather than other differences that could affect results.
Randomized clinical trials are incredible tools, and, in fact, the US Food and Drug Administration often requires at least two to be conducted before a new drug can be marketed.
But the problem is that an RCT is not possible in many cases, either because it's not practical or would require too many volunteers.
In such cases, scientists use an epidemiological study, which simply observes people going about their usual behavior, rather than randomly assigning active participants to control invariable groups.
Let's say we wanted to study whether an herbal ingredient on the market causes nausea.
Rather than deliberately giving people something that might make them nauseated, we would find those who already take the ingredient in their everyday lives.
This group is called the cohort.
We would also need a comparison group of people who do not have exposure to the ingredient.
And we would then compare statistics.
If the rate of nausea is higher in the herbal cohort, it suggests an association between the herbal supplement and nausea.
Epidemiological studies are great tools to study the health effects of almost anything, without directly interfering in people's lives or assigning them to potentially dangerous exposures.
So, why can't we rely on these studies to establish causal relationships between substances and their effects on health?
The problem is that even the best conducted epidemiological studies have inherent flaws.
Precisely because the test subjects are not randomly assigned to their groups.
For example, if the cohort in our herbal study consisted of people who took the supplement for health reasons, they may have already had higher rates of nausea than the other people in the sample.
Or the cohort group could've been composed of people who shop at health food stores and have different diets or better access to healthcare.
These factors that can affect results, in addition to the factor being studied, are known as confounding variables.
These two major pitfalls, combined with more general dangers, such as conflicts of interest or selective use of data, can make the findings of any particular epidemiological study suspect, and a good study must go out of its way to prove that its authors have taken steps to eliminate these types of errors.
But even when this has been done, the very nature of epidemiological studies, which examine differences between preexisting groups, rather than deliberately inducing changes within the same individuals, means that a single study can only demonstrate a correlation between a substance and a health outcome, rather than a true cause and effect relationship.
At the end of the day, epidemiological studies have served as excellent guides to public health, alerting us to critical health hazards, such as smoking, asbestos, lead, and many more.
But these were demonstrated through multiple, well-conducted epidemiological studies, all pointing in the same direction.
So, the next time you see a headline about a new miracle cure or the terrible danger posed by an everyday substance, try to learn more about the original study and the limitations inherent in any epidemiological study or clinical trial before jumping to conclusions.
It was a night like any other night, except here I was climbing the platonic peaks like Romeo on a second date.
(ugh) I was there for the dame.
She had eyes like imaginary numbers and curves that went on forever.
Said she wanted to go home.
Said I could help.
Said the pay was good.
Didn't say anything about climbing a...
Voice: "Who's there?"
Manny Brot: "Manny Brot, private eye."
Voice: "What are you doing here?"
"A pretty number sent me to find a stolen dingus."
Voice: "Well, to enter the cave, you must answer my riddles three."
What was it with riddles, and why do they always come in threes?
"Is it an egg?"
"No. Why would it be an egg?"
"It's usually an egg."
"What can I hold in my hand, but has zero area?"
"Is it a dodo egg?"
"It's not an egg!"
I took out the rock that had nearly brained me before and gave it a hard ponder.
The size of the rising bump on my conk said to me that this thing had area, and a lot of it.
But what if I carved out a triangle from this side here?
As any mook could see, this triangle had a quarter of the area of the full triangle.
I did the same thing again with each of the smaller triangles.
Again, a quarter of the remaining area -- gone.
And I just kept going.
After an infinite number of cuts, I was satisfied that my triangle had zero area.
A bounded shape with zero area.
Now, it's not often that I surprise myself, but my own two mitts had created something crazy, and new.
"Very good. (ahem) Now, show me a shape with finite area, but an infinitely long perimeter."
"Let me get this straight.
If I want to make a snip in the border of this shape, smooth it out, and lay it on the ground ... " "It would go on for ... " "Wait 'til I'm through, and then you can talk.
It would go on forever."
"Are you through?"
"Yeah."
"So show me that shape then."
Mmm ... I hadn't been this stuck since the Rubik's Cube fiasco of '58.
All the shapes I knew had perimeters.
Circles: 2πr. Triangles: sum of their sides.
What's this?
An angle.
An angle from heaven.
What if I were to pinch each side, like so.
A third of the way through, just so.
And do it again, and again, and again.
After each pinch, the perimeter got a third longer because where there had been three line segments, now there were four.
As for the area, every pinch made more triangles, that's true.
But those triangles were getting smaller and smaller.
You could say that the area was converging, approaching a fixed number, while the perimeter was just getting bigger and bigger, uncontrollably ballooning like an overindulgent birthday clown.
After infinity pinches, flimflam, there it was: Finite area, but infinite perimeter.
Now that is a piece of work.
"Oh, you're good. (ahem) Riddle three: Show me a picture that if I magnify it under my microscope, I'll keep seeing the original picture, no matter how much I zoom in."
"You're a strange little man."
"Thank you."
I was out of ideas, so I looked at my muse, my complex Dora.
Voice: "Who's the dame?"
And then it hit me.
"She's a heart breaker, my fractal femme fatale.
Will she do?"
"Yes, she'll do just fine."
(lightning) It was dark, and at first I thought the cave was empty, but then I noticed: the box.
The dame had played me like a triangle.
She had told me she wanted to go home.
(Lightning) What she really wanted was to bring her home here.
The fractals spread everywhere.
Most of them the same no matter how deep you looked at them, like Dora's mugshot.
Some had infinitely long perimeters, others were objects with no area or volume, all of them created through infinite repetition.
So, you wanted to know what fractals are?
Well, kid, they're the stuff that dreams are made of.

Light: it's the fastest thing in the universe, but we can still measure its speed if we slow down the animation, we can analyze light's motion using a space-time diagram, which takes a flipbook of animation panels, and turns them on their side.
In this lesson, we'll add the single experimental fact that whenever anyone measures just how fast light moves, they get the same answer: 299,792,458 meters every second, which means that when we draw light on our space-time diagram, it's world line always has to appear at the same angle.
But we saw previously that speed, or equivalently world line angles, change when we look at things from other people's perspective.
To explore this contradiction, let's see what happens if I start moving while I stand still and shine the laser at Tom.
First, we'll need to construct the space-time diagram.
Yes, that means taking all of the different panels showing the different moments in time and stacking them up.
From the side, we see the world line of the laser light at its correct fixed angle, just as before.
So far, so good.
But that space-time diagram represents Andrew's perspective.
What does it look like to me?
In the last lesson, we showed how to get Tom's perspective moving all the panels along a bit until his world line is completely vertical.
But look carefully at the light world line.
The rearrangement of the panels means it's now tilted over too far.
I'd measure light traveling faster than Andrew would.
But every experiment we've ever done, and we've tried very hard, says that everyone measures light to have a fixed speed.
So let's start again.
In the 1900s, a clever chap named Albert Einstein worked out how to see things properly, from Tom's point of view, while still getting the speed of light right.
First, we need to glue together the separate panels into one solid block.
This gives us our space-time, turning space and time into one smooth, continuous material.
And now, here is the trick.
What you do is stretch your block of space-time along the light world line, then squash it by the same amount, but at right angles to the light world line, and abracadabra!
Tom's world line has gone vertical, so this does represent the world from his point of view, but most importantly, the light world line has never changed its angle, and so light will be measured by Tom going at the correct speed.
This superb trick is known as a Lorentz transformation.
Yeah, more than a trick.
Slice up the space-time into new panels and you have the physically correct animation.
I'm stationary in the car, everything else is coming past me and the speed of light works out to be that same fixed value that we know everyone measures.
On the other hand, something strange has happened.
The fence posts aren't spaced a meter apart anymore, and my mom will be worried that I look a bit thin.
But that's not fair. Why don't I get to look thin?
I thought physics was supposed to be the same for everyone.
Yes, no, it is, and you do.
All that stretching and squashing of space-time has just muddled together what we used to think of separately as space and time.
This particular squashing effect is known as Lorentz contraction.
Okay, but I still don't look thin.
No, yes, you do.
Now that we know better about space-time, we should redraw what the scene looked like to me.
To you, I appear Lorentz contracted.
Oh but to you, I appear Lorentz contracted.
Yes.
Uh, well, at least it's fair.
And speaking of fairness, just as space gets muddled with time, time also gets muddled with space, in an effect known as time dilation.
No, at everyday speeds, such as Tom's car reaches, actually all the effects are much, much smaller than we've illustrated them.
Oh, yet, careful experiments, for instance watching the behavior of tiny particles whizzing around the Large Hadron Collider confirmed that the effects are real.
And now that space-time is an experimentally confirmed part of reality, we can get a bit more ambitious.
What if we were to start playing with the material of space-time itself?
We'll find out all about that in the next animation.
We like to think of romantic feelings as spontaneous and indescribable things that come from the heart.
But it's actually your brain running a complex series of calculations within a matter of seconds that's responsible for determining attraction.
Doesn't sound quite as poetic, does it?
But just because the calculations are happening in your brain doesn't mean those warm, fuzzy feelings are all in your head.
In fact, all five of your senses play a role, each able to vote for, or veto, a budding attraction.
The eyes are the first components in attraction.
Many visual beauty standards vary between cultures and eras, and signs of youth, fertility and good health, such as long lustrous hair, or smooth, scar-free skin, are almost always in demand because they're associated with reproductive fitness.
And when the eyes spot something they like, our instinct is to move closer so the other senses can investigate.
The nose's contribution to romance is more than noticing perfume or cologne.
It's able to pick up on natural chemical signals known as pheromones.
These not only convey important physical or genetic information about their source but are able to activate a physiological or behavioral response in the recipient.
In one study, a group of women at different points in their ovulation cycles wore the same T-shirts for three nights.
After male volunteers were randomly assigned to smell either one of the worn shirts, or a new unworn one, saliva samples showed an increase in testosterone in those who had smelled a shirt worn by an ovulating woman.
Such a testosterone boost may give a man the nudge to pursue a woman he might not have otherwise noticed.
A woman's nose is particularly attuned to MHC molecules, which are used to fight disease.
In this case, opposites attract.
When a study asked women to smell T-shirts that had been worn by different men, they preferred the odors of those whose MHC molecules differed from theirs.
This makes sense.
Genes that result in a greater variety of immunities may give offspring a major survival advantage.
Our ears also determine attraction.
Men prefer females with high-pitched, breathy voices, and wide formant spacing, correlated with smaller body size.
While women prefer low-pitched voices with a narrow formant spacing that suggest a larger body size.
And not surprisingly, touch turns out to be crucial for romance.
In this experiment, not realizing the study had begun, participants were asked to briefly hold the coffee, either hot or iced.
Later, the participants read a story about a hypothetical person, and were asked to rate their personality.
Those who had held the hot cup of coffee perceived the person in the story as happier, more social, more generous and better-natured than those who had held the cup of iced coffee, who rated the person as cold, stoic, and unaffectionate.
If a potential mate has managed to pass all these tests, there's still one more: the infamous first kiss, a rich and complex exchange of tactile and chemical cues, such as the smell of one's breath, and the taste of their mouth.
This magical moment is so critical that a majority of men and women have reported losing their attraction to someone after a bad first kiss.
Once attraction is confirmed, your bloodstream is flooded with norepinephrine, activating your fight or flight system.
Your heart beats faster, your pupils dilate, and your body releases glucose for additional energy, not because you're in danger but because your body is telling you that something important is happening.
To help you focus, norepinephrine creates a sort of tunnel vision, blocking out surrounding distractions, possibly even warping your sense of time, and enhancing your memory.
This might explain why people never forget their first kiss.
The idea of so much of our attraction being influenced by chemicals and evolutionary biology may seem cold and scientific rather than romantic, but the next time you see someone you like, try to appreciate how your entire body is playing matchmaker to decide if that beautiful stranger is right for you.
When you hear the word symmetry, maybe you picture a simple geometric shape like a square or a triangle, or the complex pattern on a butterfly's wings.
If you are artistically inclined, you might think of the subtle modulations of a Mozart concerto, or the effortless poise of a prima ballerina.
When used in every day life, the word symmetry represents vague notions of beauty, harmony and balance.
In math and science, symmetry has a different, and very specific, meaning.
In this technical sense, a symmetry is the property of an object.
Pretty much any type of object can have symmetry, from tangible things like butterflies, to abstract entities like geometric shapes.
So, what does it mean for an object to be symmetric?
Here's the definition: a symmetry is a transformation that leaves that object unchanged.
Okay, that sounds a bit abstract, so let's unpack it.
It will help to look at a particular example, like this equilateral triangle.
If we rotate our triangle through 120 degrees, around an access through its center, we end up with a triangle that's identical to the original.
In this case, the object is the triangle, and the transformation that leaves the object unchanged is rotation through 120 degrees.
So we can say an equilateral triangle is symmetric with respect to rotations of 120 degrees around its center.
If we rotated the triangle by, say, 90 degrees instead, the rotated triangle would look different to the original.
In other words, an equilateral triangle is not symmetric with respect to rotations of 90 degrees around its center.
But why do mathematicians and scientists care about symmetries?
Turns out, they're essential in many fields of math and science.
Let's take a close look at one example: symmetry in biology.
You might have noticed that there's a very familiar kind of symmetry we haven't mentioned yet: the symmetry of the right and left sides of the human body.
The transformation that gives this symmetry is reflection by an imaginary mirror that slices vertically through the body.
Biologists call this bilateral symmetry.
As with all symmetries found in living things, it's only approximate, but still a striking feature of the human body.
We humans aren't the only bilaterally symmetric organisms.
Many other animals, foxes, sharks, beetles, that butterfly we mentioned earlier, have this kind of symmetry, as do some plants like orchid flowers.
Other organisms have different symmetries, ones that only become apparent when you rotate the organism around its center point.
It's a lot like the rotational symmetry of the triangle we watched earlier.
But when it occurs in animals, this kind of symmetry is known as radial symmetry.
For instance, some sea urchins and starfish have pentaradial or five-fold symmetry, that is, symmetry with respect to rotations of 72 degrees around their center.
This symmetry also appears in plants, as you can see for yourself by slicing through an apple horizontally.
Some jellyfish are symmetric with respect to rotations of 90 degrees, while sea anemones are symmetric when you rotate them at any angle.
Some corals, on the other hand, have no symmetry at all.
They are completely asymmetric.
But why do organisms exhibit these different symmetries?
Does body symmetry tell us anything about an animal's lifestyle?
Let's look at one particular group: bilaterally symmetric animals.
In this camp, we have foxes, beetles, sharks, butterflies, and, of course, humans.
The thing that unites bilaterally symmetric animals is that their bodies are designed around movement.
If you want to pick one direction and move that way, it helps to have a front end where you can group your sensory organs-- your eyes, ears and nose.
It helps to have your mouth there too since you're more likely to run into food or enemies from this end.
You're probably familiar with a name for a group of organs, plus a mouth, mounted on the front of an animal's body.
It's called a head.
Having a head leads naturally to the development of bilateral symmetry.
And it also helps you build streamlined fins if you're a fish, aerodynamic wings if you're a bird, or well coordinated legs for running if you're a fox.
But, what does this all have to do with evolution?
Turns out, biologists can use these various body symmetries to figure out which animals are related to which.
For instance, we saw that starfish and sea urchins have five-fold symmetry.
But really what we should have said was adult starfish and sea urchins.
In their larval stage, they're bilateral, just like us humans.
For biologists, this is strong evidence that we're more closely related to starfish than we are, to say, corals, or other animals that don't exhibit bilateral symmetry at any stage in their development.
One of the most fascinating and important problems in biology is reconstructing the tree of life, discovering when and how the different branches diverged.
Thinking about something as simple as body symmetry can help us dig far into our evolutionary past and understand where we, as a species, have come from.
Welcome to Bayeku, a riverine community in Ikorodu, Lagos -- a vivid representation of several riverine communities across Nigeria, communities whose waterways have been infested by an invasive aquatic weed; communities where economic livelihoods have been hampered: fishing, marine transportation and trading; communities where fish yields have diminished; communities where schoolchildren are unable to go to school for days, sometimes weeks, on end.
Who would have thought that this plant with round leaves, inflated stems, and showy, lavender flowers would cause such havoc in these communities.
The plant is known as water hyacinth and its botanical name, Eichhornia crassipes.
Interestingly, in Nigeria, the plant is also known by other names, names associated with historical events, as well as myths.
In some places, the plant is called Babangida.
When you hear Babangida, you remember the military and military coups.
And you think: fear, restraint.
In parts of Nigeria in the Niger Delta, the plant is also known as Abiola.
When you hear Abiola, you remember annulled elections and you think: dashed hopes.
In the southwestern part of Nigeria, the plant is known as Gbe'borun.
Gbe'borun is a Yoruba phrase which translates to "gossip," or "talebearer."
When you think of gossip, you think: rapid reproduction, destruction.
And in the Igala-speaking part of Nigeria, the plant is known as A Kp'iye Kp'oma, And when you hear that, you think of death.
It literally translates to "death to mother and child."
I personally had my encounter with this plant in the year 2009.
It was shortly after I had relocated from the US to Nigeria.
I'd quit my job in corporate America and decided to take this big leap of faith, a leap of faith that came out of a deep sense of conviction that there was a lot of work to do in Nigeria in the area of sustainable development.
And so here I was in the year 2009, actually, at the end of 2009, in Lagos on the Third Mainland Bridge.
And I looked to my left and saw this very arresting image.
It was an image of fishing boats that had been hemmed in by dense mats of water hyacinth.
And I was really pained by what I saw because I thought to myself, "These poor fisherfolk, how are they going to go about their daily activities with these restrictions."
And then I thought, "There's got to be a better way."
A win-win solution whereby the environment is taken care of by the weeds being cleared out of the way and then this being turned into an economic benefit for the communities whose lives are impacted the most by the infestation of the weed.
That, I would say, was my spark moment.
And so I did further research to find out more about the beneficial uses of this weed.
Out of the several, one struck me the most.
It was the use of the plant for handicrafts.
And I thought, "What a great idea."
Personally, I love handicrafts, especially handicrafts that are woven around a story.
And so I thought, "This could be easily deployed within the communities without the requirement of technical skills."
And I thought to myself, "Three simple steps to a mega solution."
First step: Get out into the waterways and harvest the water hyacinth.
That way, you create access.
Secondly, you dry the water hyacinth stems.
And thirdly, you weave the water hyacinth into products.
The third step was a challenge.
See, I'm a computer scientist by background and not someone in the creative arts.
And so I began my quest to find out how I can learn how to weave.
And this quest took me to a community in Ibadan, where I lived, called Sabo.
Sabo translates to "strangers' quarters."
And the community is predominantly made up of people from the northern part of the country.
So I literally took my dried weeds in hand, there were several more of them, and went knocking from door to door to find out who could teach me how to weave these water hyacinth stems into ropes.
And I was directed to the shed of Malam Yahaya.
The problem, though, is that Malam Yahaya doesn't speak English and neither did I speak Hausa.
But some little kids came to the rescue and helped translate.
And that began my journey of learning how to weave and transform these dried water hyacinth stems into long ropes.
With my long ropes in hand, I was now equipped to make products.
And that was the beginning of partnerships.
Working with rattan basket makers to come up with products.
So with this in hand, I felt confident that I would be able to take this knowledge back into the riverine communities and help them to transform their adversity into prosperity.
So taking these weeds and actually weaving them into products that can be sold.
So we have pens, we have tableware, we have purses, we have tissue boxes.
Thereby, helping the communities to see water hyacinth in a different light.
Seeing water hyacinth as being valuable, being aesthetic, being durable, tough, resilient.
Changing names, changing livelihoods.
From Gbe'borun, gossip, to Olusotan, storyteller.
And from A Kp'iye Kp'oma, which is "killer of mother and child," to Ya du j'ewn w'Iye kp'Oma, "provider of food for mother and child."
And I'd like to end with a quote by Michael Margolis.
He said, "If you want to learn about a culture, listen to the stories.
And if you want to change a culture, change the stories."
And so, from Makoko community, to Abobiri, to Ewoi, to Kolo, to Owahwa, Esaba, we have changed the story.
Thank you for listening.
(Applause)
For most of history, humans had no idea what purpose the heart served.
In fact, the organ so confused Leonardo da Vinci, that he gave up studying it.
Although everyone could feel their own heart beating, it wasn't always clear what each thump was achieving.
Now we know that the heart pumps blood.
But that fact wasn't always obvious, because if a heart was exposed or taken out, the body would perish quickly.
It's also impossible to see through the blood vessels, and even if that were possible, the blood itself is opaque, making it difficult to see the heart valves working.
Even in the 21st century, only a few people in surgery teams have actually seen a working heart.
Internet searches for heart function, point to crude models, diagrams or animations that don't really show how it works.
It's as if there has been a centuries old conspiracy amongst teachers and students to accept that heart function cannot be demonstrated.
Meaning that the next best thing is simply to cut it open and label the parts.
That way students might not fully grasp the way it works, but can superficially understand it, learning such concepts as the heart is a four-chambered organ, or potentially misleading statements like, mammals have a dual-circulation: one with blood going to the lungs and back, and another to the body and back.
In reality, mammals have a figure-eight circulation.
Blood goes from one heart pump to the lungs, back to the second heart pump, which sends it to the body, and then back to the first pump.
That's an important difference because it marks two completely different morphologies.
This confusion makes many students wary of the heart in biology lessons, thinking it signals an intimidating subject full of complicated names and diagrams.
Only those who end up studying medicine compeltely understand how it all actually works.
That's when its functions become apparent as medics get to observe the motion of the heart's valves.
So, let's imagine you're a medic for a day.
What you'll need to get started is a whole fresh heart, like one from a sheep or pig.
Immerse this heart in water and you'll see that it doesn't pump when squeezed by hand.
That's because water doesn't enter the heart cleanly enough for the pumping mechanism to work.
We can solve this problem in an extraordinarly simple way.
Simply identify the two atria and cut them off, trimming them down to the tops of the ventricles.
This makes the heart look less complicated because the atria have several incoming veins attached.
So without them there, the only vessels remaining are the two major heart arteries: the aorta and pulmonary artery, which rise like white columns from between the ventricles.
It looks -- and really is -- very simple.
If you run water into the right ventricle from a tap (the left also works, but less spectacularly), you'll see that the ventricular valve tries to close against the incoming stream.
And then ventricle inflates with water.
Squeeze the ventricle and a stream of water squirts out of the pulmonary artery.
The ventricular valves, called the tricuspid in the right ventricle and the mitral in the left, can be seen through the clear water opening and closing like parachutes as the ventricle is rhythmically squeezed.
This flow of water mimics the flow of blood in life.
The valves are completely efficient.
You'll notice they don't leak at all when the ventricles are squeezed.
Over time, they also close against each other with very little wear and tear, which explains how this mechanism continues to work seamlessly for more than 2 billion beats a heart gives in its lifetime.
Now, anyone studying the heart can hold one in their hands, make it pump for real and watch the action unfold.
So place your hand above your own and feel its rhymic beat.
Understanding how this dependable inner pump works gives new resonance to the feeling you get when you run a race, drink too much caffeine or catch the eye of the one you love.
Let's say that it would take you ten minutes to solve this puzzle.
How long would it take if you received constant electric shocks to your hands?
Longer, right?
Because the pain would distract you from the task.
Well, maybe not; it depends on how you handle pain.
Some people are distracted by pain.
It takes them longer to complete a task, and they do it less well.
Other people use tasks to distract themselves from pain, and those people actually do the task faster and better when they're in pain than when they're not.
Some people can just send their mind wandering to distract themselves from pain.
How can different people be subjected to the exact same painful stimulus and yet experience the pain so differently?
And why does this matter?
First of all, what is pain?
Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience, associated with actual or potential tissue damage.
Pain is something we experience, so it's best measured by what you say it is.
Pain has an intensity; you can describe it on a scale from zero, no pain, to ten, the most pain imaginable.
But pain also has a character, like sharp, dull, burning, or aching.
What exactly creates these perceptions of pain?
Well, when you get hurt, special tissue damage-sensing nerve cells, called nociceptors, fire and send signals to the spinal cord and then up to the brain.
Processing work gets done by cells called neurons and glia.
This is your Grey matter.
And brain superhighways carry information as electrical impulses from one area to another.
This is your white matter.
The superhighway that carries pain information from the spinal cord to the brain is our sensing pathway that ends in the cortex, a part of the brain that decides what to do with the pain signal.
Another system of interconnected brain cells called the salience network decides what to pay attention to.
Since pain can have serious consequences, the pain signal immediately activates the salience network.
Now, you're paying attention.
The brain also responds to the pain and has to cope with these pain signals.
So, motor pathways are activated to take your hand off a hot stove, for example.
But modulation networks are also activated that deliver endorphins and enkephalins, chemicals released when you're in pain or during extreme exercise, creating the runner's high.
These chemical systems help regulate and reduce pain.
All these networks and pathways work together to create your pain experience, to prevent further tissue damage, and help you to cope with pain.
This system is similar for everyone, but the sensitivity and efficacy of these brain circuits determines how much you feel and cope with pain.
This is why some people have greater pain than others and why some develop chronic pain that does not respond to treatment, while others respond well.
Variability in pain sensitivities is not so different than all kinds of variability in responses to other stimuli.
Like how some people love roller coasters, but other people suffer from terrible motion sickness.
Why does it matter that there is variability in our pain brain circuits?
Well, there are many treatments for pain, targeting different systems.
For mild pain, non-prescription medications can act on cells where the pain signals start.
Other stronger pain medicines and anesthetics work by reducing the activity in pain-sensing circuits or boosting our coping system, or endorphins.
Some people can cope with pain using methods that involve distraction, relaxation, meditation, yoga, or strategies that can be taught, like cognitive behavioral therapy.
For some people who suffer from severe chronic pain, that is pain that doesn't go away months after their injury should have healed, none of the regular treatments work.
Traditionally, medical science has been about testing treatments on large groups to determine what would help a majority of patients.
But this has usually left out some who didn't benefit from the treatment or experienced side effects.
Now, new treatments that directly stimulate or block certain pain-sensing attention or modulation networks are being developed, along with ways to tailor them to individual patients, using tools like magnetic resonance imaging to map brain pathways.
Figuring out how your brain responds to pain is the key to finding the best treatment for you.
That's true personalized medicine.
How do you know what's happening in your world?
The amount of information just a click away may be limitless, but the time and energy we have to absorb and evaluate it is not.
All the information in the world won't be very useful unless you know how to read the news.
To your grandparents, parents, or even older siblings, this idea would have sounded strange.
Only a few decades ago, news was broad-based.
Your choices were limited to a couple of general interest magazines and newspaper of record, and three or four TV networks where trusted newscasters delivered the day's news at the same reliable time every evening.
But the problems with this system soon became apparent as mass media spread.
While it was known that authoritarian countries controlled and censored information, a series of scandals showed that democratic governments were also misleading the public, often with media cooperation.
Revelations of covert wars, secret assassinations, and political corruption undermined public faith in official narratives presented by mainstream sources.
This breakdown of trust in media gatekeepers lead to alternative newspapers, radio shows, and cable news competing with the major outlets and covering events from various perspectives.
More recently, the Internet has multiplied the amount of information and viewpoints, with social media, blogs, and online video turning every citizen into a potential reporter.
But if everyone is a reporter, nobody is, and different sources may disagree, not only opinions, but on the facts themselves.
So how do you get the truth, or something close?
One of the best ways is to get the original news unfiltered by middlemen.
Instead of articles interpreting a scientific study or a politician's speech, you can often find the actual material and judge for yourself.
For current events, follow reporters on social media.
During major events, such as the Arab Spring or the Ukrainian protests, newscasters and bloggers have posted updates and recordings from the midst of the chaos.
Though many of these later appear in articles or broadcasts, keep in mind that these polished versions often combine the voice of the person who was there with the input of editors who weren't.
At the same time, the more chaotic the story, the less you should try to follow it in real time.
In events like terrorist attacks and natural disasters, today's media attempts continuous coverage even when no reliable new information is available, sometimes leading to incorrect information or false accusations of innocent people.
It's easy to be anxious in such events, but try checking for the latest information at several points in the day, rather than every few minutes, allowing time for complete details to emerge and false reports to be refuted.
While good journalism aims for objectivity, media bias is often unavoidable.
When you can't get the direct story, read coverage in multiple outlets which employ different reporters and interview different experts.
Tuning in to various sources and noting the differences lets you put the pieces together for a more complete picture.
It's also crucial to separate fact from opinion.
Words like think, likely, or probably mean that the outlet is being careful or, worse, taking a guess.
And watch out for reports that rely on anonymous sources.
These could be people who have little connection to the story, or have an interest in influencing coverage, their anonymity making them unaccountable for the information they provide.
Finally, and most importantly, try to verify news before spreading it.
While social media has enabled the truth to reach us faster, it's also allowed rumors to spread before they can be verified and falsehoods to survive long after they've been refuted.
So, before you share that unbelievable or outrageous news item, do a web search to find any additional information or context you might have missed and what others are saying about it.
Today, we are more free than ever from the old media gatekeepers who used to control the flow of information.
But with freedom comes responsibility: the responsibility to curate our own experience and ensure that this flow does not become a flood, leaving us less informed than before we took the plunge.
We have some good reasons to completely switch over to solar power.
It's cheaper in many cases, and definitely more sustainable than our dependance on traditional power plants that use resources like coal, which will eventually run out.
So why don't we replace these traditional plants with solar energy?
Because there's one factor that makes solar power very unpredictable: cloud cover.
As the sun's rays move towards Earth, some get absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, some are reflected back into outer space, but the rest make it to the Earth's surface.
The ones that aren't deviated are called direct irradiance.
The ones that are deflected by clouds are called diffuse irradiance.
And those rays that first get reflected by a surface, like a nearby building, before reaching the solar energy system are called reflected irradiance.
But before we can examine how clouds affect the sun's rays and electricity production, let's see how these solar energy systems work.
First up, we have solar towers.
These are made up of a central tower surrounded by a huge field of mirrors that track the sun's path and focus only the direct rays onto a single point on the tower, kind of like an eager beachgoer.
The heat generated by these rays is so immense that it can be used to boil water producing steam that drives a traditional turbine, which makes electricity.
But when we say solar energy systems, we're usually talking about photovoltaics, or solar panels, which are the systems most commonly used to generate solar power.
In solar panels, photons from the sun's rays hit the surface of a panel, and electrons are released to get an electric current going.
Solar panels can use all types of irradiance, while solar towers can only use direct irradiance, and this is where clouds become important because depending on their type and location relative to the sun, they can either increase or decrease the amount of electricity produced.
For instance, even a few cumulus clouds in front of the sun can reduce the electricity production in solar towers to almost zero because of this dependence on direct rays.
In solar panels, those clouds would decrease energy output as well, though not as much because solar panels can use all types of irradiance.
However, all this depends on the clouds exact positioning.
Due to reflection, or a particular phenomeon called Mie scattering, the sun's rays can actually be focused forward by clouds to create a more than 50% increase in the solar irradiance reaching a solar panel.
If this potential increase isn't accounted for, it could damage the solar panel.
Why does this matter?
Well, you wouldn't want this lesson to stop just because a cloud passed over the panel on your roof.
In solar towers, huge tanks of molten salt or oil can be used to store any excess heat and use it when needed, so that's how they manage the problem of fluctuating solar irradiance to smooth out electricity production.
But in the case of solar panels, there currently isn't any way to affordably store extra energy.
That's where traditional power plants come in because to correct for any fluctuations in these solar powered plants, extra electricity from traditional sources always needs to be available.
But then why aren't these tradtional power plants just used as a backup, instead of us humans depending on them as our main sources of energy?
Because it's impossible for an employee at a coal fired or a nuclear plant to turn a knob to produce more or less electricity depending on how many clouds there are in the sky.
The response time would simply be too slow.
Instead, to accommodate these fluctuations, some extra electricity from traditional power plants is always being produced.
On clear sky days, that extra electricity might be wasted, but when cloudy skies prevail, it's what fills the gap.
This is what we currently depend on for a constant supply of energy.
For this reason, a lot of researchers are interested in forcasting the motion and formation of clouds through satellite images or cameras that look up at the sky to maximize the energy from solar power plants and minimize energy waste.
If we could accomplish that, you'd be able to enjoy this video powered solely by the sun's rays, no matter what the weather, although if the sun is shining, you may be tempted to venture outside to go and do a different kind of cloud gazing.
I'm an underwater explorer, more specifically a cave diver.
I wanted to be an astronaut when I was a little kid, but growing up in Canada as a young girl, that wasn't really available to me.
But as it turns out, we know a lot more about space than we do about the underground waterways coursing through our planet, the very lifeblood of Mother Earth.
So I decided to do something that was even more remarkable.
Instead of exploring outer space, I wanted to explore the wonders of inner space.
Now, a lot of people will tell you that cave diving is perhaps one of the most dangerous endeavors.
I mean, imagine yourself here in this room, if you were suddenly plunged into blackness, with your only job to find the exit, sometimes swimming through these large spaces, and at other times crawling beneath the seats, following a thin guideline, just waiting for the life support to provide your very next breath.
Well, that's my workplace.
But what I want to teach you today is that our world is not one big solid rock.
It's a whole lot more like a sponge.
I can swim through a lot of the pores in our earth's sponge, but where I can't, other life-forms and other materials can make that journey without me.
And my voice is the one that's going to teach you about the inside of Mother Earth.
There was no guidebook available to me when I decided to be the first person to cave dive inside Antarctic icebergs.
In 2000, this was the largest moving object on the planet.
It calved off the Ross Ice Shelf, and we went down there to explore ice edge ecology and search for life-forms beneath the ice.
We use a technology called rebreathers.
It's an awful lot like the same technology that is used for space walks.
This technology enables us to go deeper than we could've imagined even 10 years ago.
We use exotic gases, and we can make missions even up to 20 hours long underwater.
I work with biologists.
It turns out that caves are repositories of amazing life-forms, species that we never knew existed before.
Many of these life-forms live in unusual ways.
They have no pigment and no eyes in many cases, and these animals are also extremely long-lived.
In fact, animals swimming in these caves today are identical in the fossil record that predates the extinction of the dinosaurs.
So imagine that: these are like little swimming dinosaurs.
What can they teach us about evolution and survival?
When we look at an animal like this remipede swimming in the jar, he has giant fangs with venom.
He can actually attack something 40 times his size and kill it.
If he were the size of a cat, he'd be the most dangerous thing on our planet.
And these animals live in remarkably beautiful places, and in some cases, caves like this, that are very young, yet the animals are ancient.
How did they get there?
I also work with physicists, and they're interested oftentimes in global climate change.
They can take rocks within the caves, and they can slice them and look at the layers within with rocks, much like the rings of a tree, and they can count back in history and learn about the climate on our planet at very different times.
The red that you see in this photograph is actually dust from the Sahara Desert.
So it's been picked up by wind, blown across the Atlantic Ocean.
It's rained down in this case on the island of Abaco in the Bahamas.
It soaks in through the ground and deposits itself in the rocks within these caves.
And when we look back in the layers of these rocks, we can find times when the climate was very, very dry on earth, and we can go back many hundreds of thousands of years.
Paleoclimatologists are also interested in where the sea level stands were at other times on earth.
Here in Bermuda, my team and I embarked on the deepest manned dives ever conducted in the region, and we were looking for places where the sea level used to lap up against the shoreline, many hundreds of feet below current levels.
I also get to work with paleontologists and archaeologists.
In places like Mexico, in the Bahamas, and even in Cuba, we're looking at cultural remains and also human remains in caves, and they tell us a lot about some of the earliest inhabitants of these regions.
But my very favorite project of all was over 15 years ago, when I was a part of the team that made the very first accurate, three-dimensional map of a subterranean surface.
This device that I'm driving through the cave was actually creating a three-dimensional model as we drove it.
We also used ultra low frequency radio to broadcast back to the surface our exact position within the cave.
So I swam under houses and businesses and bowling alleys and golf courses, and even under a Sonny's BBQ Restaurant, Pretty remarkable, and what that taught me was that everything we do on the surface of our earth will be returned to us to drink.
Our water planet is not just rivers, lakes and oceans, but it's this vast network of groundwater that knits us all together.
It's a shared resource from which we all drink.
And when we can understand our human connections with our groundwater and all of our water resources on this planet, then we'll be working on the problem that's probably the most important issue of this century.
So I never got to be that astronaut that I always wanted to be, but this mapping device, designed by Dr. Bill Stone, will be.
It's actually morphed.
It's now a self-swimming autonomous robot, artificially intelligent, and its ultimate goal is to go to Jupiter's moon Europa and explore oceans beneath the frozen surface of that body.
And that's pretty amazing.
(Applause)
Think about all the things that need to happen for a human settlement to thrive: obtaining food, building shelter, raising children and more.
There needs to be a way to divide resources, organize major efforts and distribute labor efficiently.
Now imagine having to do this without any sort of planning or higher level communication.
Welcome to the ant colony.
Ants have some of the most complex social organization in the animal kingdom, living in structured colonies containing different types of members who perform specific roles.
But although this may sound similar to some human societies, this organization doesn't arise from any higher level decisions, but is part of a biologically programmed cycle.
In many species, all the winged males and winged virgin queens from all the nearby colonies in the population each leave from their different nests and meet at a central place to mate, using pheromones to guide each other to a breeding ground.
After mating, the males die off, while females try to establish a new colony.
The few that are successful settle down in a suitable spot, lose their wings, and begin laying eggs, selectively fertilizing some using stored sperm they've saved up from mating.
Fertilized eggs grow into female workers who care for the queen and her eggs.
They will then defend the colony and forage for food, while unfertilized eggs grow into males whose only job is to wait until they are ready to leave the nest and reproduce, beginning the cycle again.
So how do worker ants decide what to do and when?
Well, they don't really.
Although they have no methods of intentional communication, individual ants do interact with one another through touch, sound and chemical signals.
These stimuli accomplish many things from serving as an alarm to other ants if one is killed, to signaling when a queen is nearing the end of her reproductive life.
But one of the most impressive collective capabilities of an ant colony is to thoroughly and efficiently explore large areas without any predetermined plan.
Most species of ants have little or no sense of sight and can only smell things in their vicinity.
Combined with their lack of high level coordination, this would seem to make them terrible explorers, but there is an amazingly simple way that ants maximize their searching efficiency; by changing their movement patterns based on individual interactions.
When two ants meet, they sense each other by touching antennae.
If there are many ants in a small area this will happen more often causing them to respond by moving in more convoluted, random paths in order to search more thoroughly.
But in a larger area, with less ants, where such meetings happen less often, they can walk in straight lines to cover more ground.
While exploring their environment in this way, an ant may come across any number of things, from threats or enemies, to alternate nesting sites.
And some species have another capability known as recruitment.
When one of these ants happens to find food, it will return with it, marking its path with a chemical scent.
Other ants will then follow this pheromone trail, renewing it each time they manage to find food and return.
Once the food in that spot is depleted, the ants stop marking their return.
The scent dissipates and ants are no longer attracted to that path.
These seemingly crude methods of search and retrieval are, in fact, so useful that they are applied in computer models to obtain optimal solutions from decentralized elements, working randomly and exchanging simple information.
This has many theoretical and practical applications, from solving the famous traveling salesman problem, to scheduling computing tasks and optimizing Internet searches, to enabling groups of robots to search a minefield or a burning building collectively, without any central control.
But you can observe these fascinatingly simple, yet effective, processes directly through some simple experiments, by allowing ants to enter empty spaces of various sizes and paying attention to their behavior.
Ants may not be able to vote, hold meetings or even make any plans, but we humans may still be able to learn something from the way that such simple creatures are able to function so effectively in such complex ways.
Tattoos have often been presented in popular media as either marks of the dangerous and deviant or trendy youth fads.
But while tattoo styles come and go, and their meaning has differed greatly across cultures, the practice is as old as civilization itself.
Decorative skin markings have been discovered in human remains all over the world, with the oldest found on a Peruvian mummy dating back to 6,000 BCE.
But have you ever wondered how tattooing really works?
You may know that we shed our skin, losing about 30-40,000 skin cells per hour.
That's about 1,000,000 per day.
So, how come the tattoo doesn't gradually flake off along with them?
The simple answer is that tattooing involves getting pigment deeper into the skin than the outermost layer that gets shed.
Throughout history, different cultures have used various methods to accomplish this.
But the first modern tattooing machine was modeled after Thomas Edison's engraving machine and ran on electricity.
Tattooing machines used today insert tiny needles, loaded with dye, into the skin at a frequency of 50 to 3,000 times per minute.
The needles punch through the epidermis, allowing ink to seep deep into the dermis, which is composed of collagen fibers, nerves, glands, blood vessels and more.
Every time a needle penetrates, it causes a wound that alerts the body to begin the inflammatory process, calling immune system cells to the wound site to begin repairing the skin.
And it is this very process that makes tattoos permanent.
First, specialized cells called macrophages eat the invading material in an attempt to clean up the inflammatory mess.
As these cells travel through the lymphatic system, some of them are carried back with a belly full of dye into the lymph nodes while others remain in the dermis.
With no way to dispose of the pigment, the dyes inside them remain visible through the skin.
Some of the ink particles are also suspended in the gel-like matrix of the dermis, while others are engulfed by dermal cells called fibroblasts.
Initially, ink is deposited into the epidermis as well, but as the skin heals, the damaged epidermal cells are shed and replaced by new, dye-free cells with the topmost layer peeling off like a heeling sunburn.
Blistering or crusting is not typically seen with professional tattoos and complete epidermal regeneration requires 2-4 weeks, during which excess sun exposure and swimming should be avoided to prevent fading.
Dermal cells, however, remain in place until they die.
When they do, they are taken up, ink and all, by younger cells nearby, so the ink stays where it is.
But with time, tattoos do fade naturally as the body reacts to the alien pigment particles, slowly breaking them down to be carried off by the immune system's macrophages.
Ultraviolet radiation can also contribute to this pigment breakdown, though it can be mitigated by the use of sunblock.
But since the dermal cells are relatively stable, much of the ink will remain deep in the skin for a person's whole life.
But if tattoos are embedded in your skin for life, is there any way to erase them?
Technically, yes.
Today, a laser is used to penetrate the epidermis and blast apart underlying pigment colors of various wavelengths, black being the easiest to target.
The laser beam breaks the ink globules into smaller particles that can then be cleared away by the macrophages.
But some color inks are harder to remove than others, and there could be complications.
For this reason, removing a tattoo is still more difficult than getting one, but not impossible.
So a single tattoo may not truly last forever, but tattoos have been around longer than any existing culture.
And their continuing popularity means that the art of tattooing is here to stay.
You've probably heard that carbon dioxide is warming the Earth, but how does it work?
Is it like the glass of a greenhouse or like an insulating blanket?
Well, not entirely.
The answer involves a bit of quantum mechanics, but don't worry, we'll start with a rainbow.
If you look closely at sunlight separated through a prism, you'll see dark gaps where bands of color went missing.
Where did they go?
Before reaching our eyes, different gases absorbed those specific parts of the spectrum.
For example, oxygen gas snatched up some of the dark red light, and sodium grabbed two bands of yellow.
But why do these gases absorb specific colors of light?
This is where we enter the quantum realm.
Every atom and molecule has a set number of possible energy levels for its electrons.
To shift its electrons from the ground state to a higher level, a molecule needs to gain a certain amount of energy.
No more, no less.
It gets that energy from light, which comes in more energy levels than you could count.
Light consists of tiny particles called photons and the amount of energy in each photon corresponds to its color.
Red light has lower energy and longer wavelengths.
Purple light has higher energy and shorter wavelengths.
Sunlight offers all the photons of the rainbow, so a gas molecule can choose the photons that carry the exact amount of energy needed to shift the molecule to its next energy level.
When this match is made, the photon disappers as the molecule gains its energy, and we get a small gap in our rainbow.
If a photon carries too much or too little energy, the molecule has no choice but to let it fly past.
This is why glass is transparent.
The atoms in glass do not pair well with any of the energy levels in visible light, so the photons pass through.
So, which photons does carbon dioxide prefer?
Where is the black line in our rainbow that explains global warming?
Well, it's not there.
Carbon dioxide doesn't absorb light directly from the Sun.
It absorbs light from a totally different celestial body.
One that doesn't appear to be emitting light at all: Earth.
If you're wondering why our planet doesn't seem to be glowing, it's because the Earth doesn't emit visible light.
It emits infared light.
The light that our eyes can see, including all of the colors of the rainbow, is just a small part of the larger spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, which includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma rays.
It may seem strange to think of these things as light, but there is no fundamental difference between visible light and other electromagnetic radiation.
It's the same energy, but at a higher or lower level.
In fact, it's a bit presumptuous to define the term visible light by our own limitations.
After all, infrared light is visible to snakes, and ultraviolet light is visible to birds.
If our eyes were adapted to see light of 1900 megahertz, then a mobile phone would be a flashlight, and a cell phone tower would look like a huge lantern.
Earth emits infrared radiation because every object with a temperature above absolute zero will emit light.
This is called thermal radiation.
The hotter an object gets, the higher frequency the light it emits.
When you heat a piece of iron, it will emit more and more frequencies of infrared light, and then, at a temperature of around 450 degrees Celsius, its light will reach the visible spectrum.
At first, it will look red hot.
And with even more heat, it will glow white with all of the frequencies of visible light.
This is how traditional light bulbs were designed to work and why they're so wasteful.
95% of the light they emit is invisible to our eyes.
It's wasted as heat.
Earth's infrared radiation would escape to space if there weren't greenhouse gas molecules in our atmophere.
Just as oxygen gas prefers the dark red photons, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases match with infrared photons.
They provide the right amount of energy to shift the gas molecules into their higher energy level.
Shortly after a carbon dioxide molecule absorbs an infrared photon, it will fall back to its previous energy level, and spit a photon back out in a random direction.
Some of that energy then returns to Earth's surface, causing warming.
The more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the more likely that infrared photons will land back on Earth and change our climate.
I’m working a lot with motion and animation, and also I'm an old DJ and a musician.
So, music videos are something that I always found interesting, but they always seem to be so reactive.
So I was thinking, can you remove us as creators and try to make the music be the voice and have the animation following it?
So with two designers, Tolga and Christina, at my office, we took a track -- many of you probably know it. It’s about 25 years old, and it's David Byrne and Brian Eno -- and we did this little animation.
And I think that it's maybe interesting, also, that it deals with two problematic issues, which are rising waters and religion.
Song: Before God destroyed the people on the Earth, he warned Noah to build an Ark.
And after Noah built his Ark, I believe he told Noah to warn the people that they must change all their wicked ways before he come upon them and destroy them.
And when Noah had done built his Ark, I understand that somebody began to rend a song.
And the song began to move on I understand like this.
And when Noah had done built his Ark ...
Move on ... In fact ... Concern ...
So they get tired, has come dark and rain; they get weary and tired.
And then he went and knocked an old lady house.
And old lady ran to the door and say, "Who is it?"
Jack say, "Me, Mama-san, could we spend the night here?
Because we’re far from home, we’re very tired."
And the old lady said, "Oh yes, come on in."
It was come dark and rain, will make you weary and tired.
(Applause)
We've evolved with tools, and tools have evolved with us.
Our ancestors created these hand axes 1.5 million years ago, shaping them to not only fit the task at hand but also their hand.
However, over the years, tools have become more and more specialized.
These sculpting tools have evolved through their use, and each one has a different form which matches its function.
And they leverage the dexterity of our hands in order to manipulate things with much more precision.
But as tools have become more and more complex, we need more complex controls to control them.
And so designers have become very adept at creating interfaces that allow you to manipulate parameters while you're attending to other things, such as taking a photograph and changing the focus or the aperture.
But the computer has fundamentally changed the way we think about tools because computation is dynamic.
So it can do a million different things and run a million different applications.
However, computers have the same static physical form for all of these different applications and the same static interface elements as well.
And I believe that this is fundamentally a problem, because it doesn't really allow us to interact with our hands and capture the rich dexterity that we have in our bodies.
And my belief is that, then, we must need new types of interfaces that can capture these rich abilities that we have and that can physically adapt to us and allow us to interact in new ways.
And so that's what I've been doing at the MIT Media Lab and now at Stanford.
So with my colleagues, Daniel Leithinger and Hiroshi Ishii, we created inFORM, where the interface can actually come off the screen and you can physically manipulate it.
Or you can visualize 3D information physically and touch it and feel it to understand it in new ways.
Or you can interact through gestures and direct deformations to sculpt digital clay.
Or interface elements can arise out of the surface and change on demand.
And the idea is that for each individual application, the physical form can be matched to the application.
And I believe this represents a new way that we can interact with information, by making it physical.
So the question is, how can we use this?
Traditionally, urban planners and architects build physical models of cities and buildings to better understand them.
So with Tony Tang at the Media Lab, we created an interface built on inFORM to allow urban planners to design and view entire cities.
And now you can walk around it, but it's dynamic, it's physical, and you can also interact directly.
Or you can look at different views, such as population or traffic information, but it's made physical.
We also believe that these dynamic shape displays can really change the ways that we remotely collaborate with people.
So when we're working together in person, I'm not only looking at your face but I'm also gesturing and manipulating objects, and that's really hard to do when you're using tools like Skype.
And so using inFORM, you can reach out from the screen and manipulate things at a distance.
So we used the pins of the display to represent people's hands, allowing them to actually touch and manipulate objects at a distance.
And you can also manipulate and collaborate on 3D data sets as well, so you can gesture around them as well as manipulate them.
And that allows people to collaborate on these new types of 3D information in a richer way than might be possible with traditional tools.
And so you can also bring in existing objects, and those will be captured on one side and transmitted to the other.
Or you can have an object that's linked between two places, so as I move a ball on one side, the ball moves on the other as well.
And so we do this by capturing the remote user using a depth-sensing camera like a Microsoft Kinect.
Now, you might be wondering how does this all work, and essentially, what it is, is 900 linear actuators that are connected to these mechanical linkages that allow motion down here to be propagated in these pins above.
So it's not that complex compared to what's going on at CERN, but it did take a long time for us to build it.
And so we started with a single motor, a single linear actuator, and then we had to design a custom circuit board to control them.
And then we had to make a lot of them.
And so the problem with having 900 of something is that you have to do every step 900 times.
And so that meant that we had a lot of work to do.
So we sort of set up a mini-sweatshop in the Media Lab and brought undergrads in and convinced them to do "research" -- (Laughter) and had late nights watching movies, eating pizza and screwing in thousands of screws.
You know -- research.
(Laughter) But anyway, I think that we were really excited by the things that inFORM allowed us to do.
Increasingly, we're using mobile devices, and we interact on the go.
But mobile devices, just like computers, are used for so many different applications.
So you use them to talk on the phone, to surf the web, to play games, to take pictures or even a million different things.
But again, they have the same static physical form for each of these applications.
And so we wanted to know how can we take some of the same interactions that we developed for inFORM and bring them to mobile devices.
So at Stanford, we created this haptic edge display, which is a mobile device with an array of linear actuators that can change shape, so you can feel in your hand where you are as you're reading a book.
Or you can feel in your pocket new types of tactile sensations that are richer than the vibration.
Or buttons can emerge from the side that allow you to interact where you want them to be.
Or you can play games and have actual buttons.
And so we were able to do this by embedding 40 small, tiny linear actuators inside the device, and that allow you not only to touch them but also back-drive them as well.
But we've also looked at other ways to create more complex shape change.
So we've used pneumatic actuation to create a morphing device where you can go from something that looks a lot like a phone ...
to a wristband on the go.
And so together with Ken Nakagaki at the Media Lab, we created this new high-resolution version that uses an array of servomotors to change from interactive wristband to a touch-input device to a phone.
(Laughter) And we're also interested in looking at ways that users can actually deform the interfaces to shape them into the devices that they want to use.
So you can make something like a game controller, and then the system will understand what shape it's in and change to that mode.
So, where does this point?
How do we move forward from here?
I think, really, where we are today is in this new age of the Internet of Things, where we have computers everywhere -- they're in our pockets, they're in our walls, they're in almost every device that you'll buy in the next five years.
But what if we stopped thinking about devices and think instead about environments?
And so how can we have smart furniture or smart rooms or smart environments or cities that can adapt to us physically, and allow us to do new ways of collaborating with people and doing new types of tasks?
So for the Milan Design Week, we created TRANSFORM, which is an interactive table-scale version of these shape displays, which can move physical objects on the surface; for example, reminding you to take your keys.
But it can also transform to fit different ways of interacting.
So if you want to work, then it can change to sort of set up your work system.
And so as you bring a device over, it creates all the affordances you need and brings other objects to help you accomplish those goals.
So, in conclusion, I really think that we need to think about a new, fundamentally different way of interacting with computers.
We need computers that can physically adapt to us and adapt to the ways that we want to use them and really harness the rich dexterity that we have of our hands, and our ability to think spatially about information by making it physical.
But looking forward, I think we need to go beyond this, beyond devices, to really think about new ways that we can bring people together, and bring our information into the world, and think about smart environments that can adapt to us physically.
So with that, I will leave you.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Check this out: Here's a grid, nothing special, just a basic grid, very grid-y.
But look closer, into this white spot at the center where the two central vertical and horizontal lines intersect.
Look very closely. Notice anything funny about this spot?
Yeah, nothing.
But keep looking. Get weird and stare at it.
Now, keeping your gaze fixed on this white spot, check what's happening in your peripheral vision.
The other spots, are they still white? Or do they show weird flashes of grey?
Now look at this pan for baking muffins.
Oh, sorry, one of the cups is inverted. It pops up instead of dipping down.
Wait, no spin the pan. The other five are domed now?
Whichever it is, this pan's defective.
Here's a photo of Abraham Lincoln, and here's one upside down.
Nothing weird going on here.
Wait, turn that upside down one right side up. What have they done to Abe?
Those are just three optical illusions, images that seem to trick us.
How do they work?
Are magical things happening in the images themselves?
While we could certainly be sneaking flashes of grey into the peripheral white spots of our animated grid, first off, we promise we aren't.
You'll see the same effect with a grid printed on a plain old piece of paper.
In reality, this grid really is just a grid. But not to your brain's visual system.
Here's how it interprets the light information you call this grid.
The white intersections are surrounded by relatively more white on all four sides than any white point along a line segment.
Your retinal ganglion cells notice that there is more white around the intersections because they are organized to increase contrast with lateral inhibition.
Better contrast means it's easier to see the edge of something.
And things are what your eyes and brain have evolved to see.
Your retinal ganglion cells don't respond as much at the crossings because there is more lateral inhibition for more white spots nearby compared to the lines, which are surrounded by black.
This isn't just a defect in your eyes; if you can see, then optical illusions can trick you with your glasses on or with this paper or computer screen right up in your face.
What optical illusions show us is the way your photo receptors and brain assemble visual information into the three-dimensional world you see around you, where edges should get extra attention because things with edges can help you or kill you.
Look at that muffin pan again. You know what causes confusion here?
Your brain's visual cortex operates on assumptions about the lighting of this image.
It expects light to come from a single source, shining down from above.
And so these shading patterns could only have been caused by light shining down on the sloping sides of a dome, or the bottom of a hole.
If we carefully recreate these clues by drawing shading patterns, even on a flat piece of paper, our brain reflexively creates the 3D concave or convex shape.
Now for that creepy Lincoln upside down face.
Faces trigger activity in areas of the brain that have specifically evolved to help us recognize faces.
Like the fusiform face area and others in the occipital and temporal lobes.
It makes sense, too, we're very social animals with highly complex ways of interacting with each other.
When we see faces, we have to recognize they are faces and figure out what they're expressing very quickly.
And what we focus on most are the eyes and mouth.
That's how we figure out if someone is mad at us or wants to be our friend.
In the upside down Lincoln face, the eyes and mouth were actually right side up, so you didn't notice anything was off.
But when we flipped the whole image over, the most important parts of the face, the eyes and mouth, were now upside down, and you realized something fishy was up.
You realized your brain had taken a short cut and missed something.
But your brain wasn't really being lazy, it's just very busy.
So it spends cognitive energy as efficiently as possible, using assumptions about visual information to create a tailored, edited vision of the world.
Imagine your brain calling out these edits on the fly: "Okay, those squares could be objects.
Let's enhance that black-white contrast on the sides with lateral inhibition.
Darken those corners!
Dark grey fading into light grey?
Assume overhead sunlight falling on a sloping curve. Next!
Those eyes look like most eyes I've seen before, nothing weird going on here."
See? Our visual tricks have revealed your brain's job as a busy director of 3D animation in a studio inside your skull, allocating cognitive energy and constructing a world on the fly with tried and mostly -- but not always -- true tricks of its own.
How do you know you're real?
It's an obvious question until you try to answer it, but let's take it seriously.
How do you really know you exist?
In his "Meditations on First Philosophy," René Descartes tried to answer that very question, demolishing all his preconceived notions and opinions to begin again from the foundations.
All his knowledge had come from his sensory perceptions of the world.
Same as you, right?
You know you're watching this video with your eyes, hearing it with your ears.
Your senses show you the world as it is.
They aren't deceiving you, but sometimes they do.
You might mistake a person far away for someone else, or you're sure you're about to catch a flyball, and it hits the ground in front of you.
But come on, right here and now, you know what's right in front of you is real.
Your eyes, your hands, your body: that's you.
Only crazy people would deny that, and you know you're not crazy.
Anyone who'd doubt that must be dreaming.
Oh no, what if you're dreaming?
Dreams feel real.
You can believe you're swimming, flying or fighting off monsters with your bare hands, when your real body is lying in bed.
No, no, no.
Ah! But when you aren't, you don't know you aren't, so you can't prove you aren't dreaming.
Maybe the body you perceive yourself to have isn't really there.
Maybe all of reality, even its abstract concepts, like time, shape, color and number are false, all just deceptions concocted by an evil genius!
No, seriously.
Descartes asks if you can disprove the idea that an evil genius demon has tricked you into believing reality is real.
Perhaps this diabolical deceiver has duped you.
The world, your perceptions of it, your very body.
You can't disprove that they're all just made up, and how could you exist without them?
You couldn't! So, you don't.
Life is but a dream, and I bet you aren't row, row, rowing the boat merrily at all, are you?
No, you're rowing it wearily like the duped, nonexistent doof you are/aren't.
Do you find that convincing?
Are you persuaded?
If you aren't, good; if you are, even better, because by being persuaded, you would prove that you're a persuaded being.
You can't be nothing if you think you're something, even if you think that something is nothing because no matter what you think, you're a thinking thing, or as Descartes put it, "I think, therefore I am," and so are you, really.
Consider throwing a ball straight into the air.
Can you predict the motion of the ball after it leaves your hand?
Sure, that's easy.
The ball will move upward until it gets to some highest point, then it will come back down and land in your hand again.
Of course, that's what happens, and you know this because you have witnessed events like this countless times.
You've been observing the physics of everyday phenomena your entire life.
But suppose we explore a question about the physics of atoms, like what does the motion of an electron around the nucleus of a hydrogen atom look like?
Could we answer that question based on our experience with everyday physics?
Definietly not. Why?
Because the physics that governs the behavior of systems at such small scales is much different than the physics of the macroscopic objects you see around you all the time.
The everyday world you know and love behaves according to the laws of classical mechanics.
But systems on the scale of atoms behave according to the laws of quantum mechanics.
This quantum world turns out to be a very strange place.
An illustration of quantum strangeness is given by a famous thought experiment: Schrödinger's cat.
A physicist, who doesn't particularly like cats, puts a cat in a box, along with a bomb that has a 50% chance of blowing up after the lid is closed.
Until we reopen the lid, there is no way of knowing whether the bomb exploded or not, and thus, no way of knowing if the cat is alive or dead.
In quantum physics, we could say that before our observation the cat was in a superposition state.
It was neither alive nor dead but rather in a mixture of both possibilities, with a 50% chance for each.
The same sort of thing happens to physical systems at quantum scales, like an electron orbiting in a hydrogen atom.
The electron isn't really orbiting at all.
It's sort of everywhere in space, all at once, with more of a probability of being at some places than others, and it's only after we measure its position that we can pinpoint where it is at that moment.
A lot like how we didn't know whether the cat was alive or dead until we opened the box.
This brings us to the strange and beautiful phenomenon of quantum entanglement.
Suppose that instead of one cat in a box, we have two cats in two different boxes.
If we repeat the Schrödinger's cat experiment with this pair of cats, the outcome of the experiment can be one of four possibilities.
Either both cats will be alive, or both will be dead, or one will be alive and the other dead, or vice versa.
The system of both cats is again in a superposition state, with each outcome having a 25% chance rather than 50%.
But here's the cool thing: quantum mechanics tells us it's possible to erase the both cats alive and both cats dead outcomes from the superposition state.
In other words, there can be a two cat system, such that the outcome will always be one cat alive and the other cat dead.
The technical term for this is that the states of the cats are entangled.
But there's something truly mindblowing about quantum entanglement.
If you prepare the system of two cats in boxes in this entangled state, then move the boxes to opposite ends of the universe, the outcome of the experiment will still always be the same.
One cat will always come out alive, and the other cat will always end up dead, even though which particular cat lives or dies is completely undetermined before we measure the outcome.
How is this possible?
How is it that the states of cats on opposite sides of the universe can be entangled in this way?
They're too far away to communicate with each other in time, so how do the two bombs always conspire such that one blows up and the other doesn't?
You might be thinking, "This is just some theoretical mumbo jumbo.
This sort of thing can't happen in the real world."
But it turns out that quantum entanglement has been confirmed in real world lab experiments.
Two subatomic particles entangled in a superposition state, where if one spins one way then the other must spin the other way, will do just that, even when there's no way for information to pass from one particle to the other indicating which way to spin to obey the rules of entanglement.
It's not surprising then that entanglement is at the core of quantum information science, a growing field studying how to use the laws of the strange quantum world in our macroscopic world, like in quantum cryptography, so spies can send secure messages to each other, or quantum computing, for cracking secret codes.
Everyday physics may start to look a bit more like the strange quantum world.
Quantum teleportation may even progress so far, that one day your cat will escape to a safer galaxy, where there are no physicists and no boxes.
I have a question.
Can a computer write poetry?
This is a provocative question.
You think about it for a minute, and you suddenly have a bunch of other questions like: What is a computer?
What is poetry?
What is creativity?
But these are questions that people spend their entire lifetime trying to answer, not in a single TED Talk.
So we're going to have to try a different approach.
So up here, we have two poems.
One of them is written by a human, and the other one's written by a computer.
I'm going to ask you to tell me which one's which.
Have a go: Poem 1: Little Fly / Thy summer's play, / My thoughtless hand / Has brush'd away.
Am I not / A fly like thee? / Or art not thou / A man like me?
Poem 2: We can feel / Activist through your life's / morning / Pauses to see, pope I hate the / Non all the night to start a / great otherwise (...) Alright, time's up.
Hands up if you think Poem 1 was written by a human.
OK, most of you.
Hands up if you think Poem 2 was written by a human.
Very brave of you, because the first one was written by the human poet William Blake.
The second one was written by an algorithm that took all the language from my Facebook feed on one day and then regenerated it algorithmically, according to methods that I'll describe a little bit later on.
So let's try another test.
Again, you haven't got ages to read this, so just trust your gut.
Poem 1: A lion roars and a dog barks. It is interesting / and fascinating that a bird will fly and not / roar or bark. Enthralling stories about animals are in my dreams and I will sing them all if I / am not exhausted or weary.
Poem 2: Oh! kangaroos, sequins, chocolate sodas! / You are really beautiful!
Pearls, / harmonicas, jujubes, aspirins! All / the stuff they've always talked about (...) Alright, time's up.
So if you think the first poem was written by a human, put your hand up.
OK.
And if you think the second poem was written by a human, put your hand up.
We have, more or less, a 50/50 split here.
It was much harder.
The answer is, the first poem was generated by an algorithm called Racter, that was created back in the 1970s, and the second poem was written by a guy called Frank O'Hara, who happens to be one of my favorite human poets.
(Laughter) So what we've just done now is a Turing test for poetry.
The Turing test was first proposed by this guy, Alan Turing, in 1950, in order to answer the question, can computers think?
Alan Turing believed that if a computer was able to have a to have a text-based conversation with a human, with such proficiency such that the human couldn't tell whether they are talking to a computer or a human, then the computer can be said to have intelligence.
So in 2013, my friend Benjamin Laird and I, we created a Turing test for poetry online.
It's called bot or not, and you can go and play it for yourselves.
But basically, it's the game we just played.
You're presented with a poem, you don't know whether it was written by a human or a computer and you have to guess.
So thousands and thousands of people have taken this test online, so we have results.
And what are the results?
Well, Turing said that if a computer could fool a human 30 percent of the time that it was a human, then it passes the Turing test for intelligence.
We have poems on the bot or not database that have fooled 65 percent of human readers into thinking it was written by a human.
So, I think we have an answer to our question.
According to the logic of the Turing test, can a computer write poetry?
Well, yes, absolutely it can.
But if you're feeling a little bit uncomfortable with this answer, that's OK.
If you're having a bunch of gut reactions to it, that's also OK because this isn't the end of the story.
Let's play our third and final test.
Again, you're going to have to read and tell me which you think is human.
Poem 1: Red flags the reason for pretty flags. / And ribbons.
Ribbons of flags / And wearing material / Reasons for wearing material. (...) Poem 2: A wounded deer leaps highest, / I've heard the daffodil I've heard the flag to-day / I've heard the hunter tell; / 'Tis but the ecstasy of death, / And then the brake is almost done (...) OK, time is up.
So hands up if you think Poem 1 was written by a human.
Hands up if you think Poem 2 was written by a human.
Whoa, that's a lot more people.
So you'd be surprised to find that Poem 1 was written by the very human poet Gertrude Stein.
And Poem 2 was generated by an algorithm called RKCP.
Now before we go on, let me describe very quickly and simply, how RKCP works.
So RKCP is an algorithm designed by Ray Kurzweil, who's a director of engineering at Google and a firm believer in artificial intelligence.
So, you give RKCP a source text, it analyzes the source text in order to find out how it uses language, and then it regenerates language that emulates that first text.
So in the poem we just saw before, Poem 2, the one that you all thought was human, it was fed a bunch of poems by a poet called Emily Dickinson it looked at the way she used language, learned the model, and then it regenerated a model according to that same structure.
But the important thing to know about RKCP is that it doesn't know the meaning of the words it's using.
The language is just raw material, it could be Chinese, it could be in Swedish, it could be the collected language from your Facebook feed for one day.
It's just raw material.
And nevertheless, it's able to create a poem that seems more human than Gertrude Stein's poem, and Gertrude Stein is a human.
So what we've done here is, more or less, a reverse Turing test.
So Gertrude Stein, who's a human, is able to write a poem that fools a majority of human judges into thinking that it was written by a computer.
Therefore, according to the logic of the reverse Turing test, Gertrude Stein is a computer.
(Laughter) Feeling confused?
I think that's fair enough.
So far we've had humans that write like humans, we have computers that write like computers, we have computers that write like humans, but we also have, perhaps most confusingly, humans that write like computers.
So what do we take from all of this?
Do we take that William Blake is somehow more of a human than Gertrude Stein?
Or that Gertrude Stein is more of a computer than William Blake?
(Laughter) These are questions I've been asking myself for around two years now, and I don't have any answers.
But what I do have are a bunch of insights about our relationship with technology.
So my first insight is that, for some reason, we associate poetry with being human.
So that when we ask, "Can a computer write poetry?"
we're also asking, "What does it mean to be human and how do we put boundaries around this category?
How do we say who or what can be part of this category?"
This is an essentially philosophical question, I believe, and it can't be answered with a yes or no test, like the Turing test.
I also believe that Alan Turing understood this, and that when he devised his test back in 1950, he was doing it as a philosophical provocation.
So my second insight is that, when we take the Turing test for poetry, we're not really testing the capacity of the computers because poetry-generating algorithms, they're pretty simple and have existed, more or less, since the 1950s.
What we are doing with the Turing test for poetry, rather, is collecting opinions about what constitutes humanness.
So, what I've figured out, we've seen this when earlier today, we say that William Blake is more of a human than Gertrude Stein.
Of course, this doesn't mean that William Blake was actually more human or that Gertrude Stein was more of a computer.
It simply means that the category of the human is unstable.
This has led me to understand that the human is not a cold, hard fact.
Rather, it is something that's constructed with our opinions and something that changes over time.
So my final insight is that the computer, more or less, works like a mirror that reflects any idea of a human that we show it.
We show it Emily Dickinson, it gives Emily Dickinson back to us.
We show it William Blake, that's what it reflects back to us.
We show it Gertrude Stein, what we get back is Gertrude Stein.
More than any other bit of technology, the computer is a mirror that reflects any idea of the human we teach it.
So I'm sure a lot of you have been hearing a lot about artificial intelligence recently.
And much of the conversation is, can we build it?
Can we build an intelligent computer?
Can we build a creative computer?
What we seem to be asking over and over is can we build a human-like computer?
But what we've seen just now is that the human is not a scientific fact, that it's an ever-shifting, concatenating idea and one that changes over time.
So that when we begin to grapple with the ideas of artificial intelligence in the future, we shouldn't only be asking ourselves, "Can we build it?"
But we should also be asking ourselves, "What idea of the human do we want to have reflected back to us?"
This is an essentially philosophical idea, and it's one that can't be answered with software alone, but I think requires a moment of species-wide, existential reflection.
Thank you.

On September 1st, 1953, William Scoville used a hand crank and a cheap drill saw to bore into a young man's skull, cutting away vital pieces of his brain and sucking them out through a metal tube.
But this wasn't a scene from a horror film or a gruesome police report.
Dr. Scoville was one of the most renowned neurosurgeons of his time, and the young man was Henry Molaison, the famous patient known as "H.M.", whose case provided amazing insights into how our brains work.
As a boy, Henry had cracked his skull in an accident and soon began having seizures, blacking out and losing control of bodily functions.
After enduring years of frequent episodes, and even dropping out of high school, the desperate young man had turned to Dr. Scoville, a daredevil known for risky surgeries.
Partial lobotomies had been used for decades to treat mental patients based on the notion that mental functions were strictly localized to corresponding brain areas.
Having successfully used them to reduce seizures in psychotics, Scoville decided to remove H.M.'s hippocampus, a part of the limbic system that was associated with emotion but whose function was unknown.
At first glance, the operation had succeeded.
H.M.'s seizures virtually disappeared, with no change in personality, and his IQ even improved.
But there was one problem: His memory was shot.
Besides losing most of his memories from the previous decade, H.M. was unable to form new ones, forgetting what day it was, repeating comments, and even eating multiple meals in a row.
When Scoville informed another expert, Wilder Penfield, of the results, he sent a Ph.D student named Brenda Milner to study H.M. at his parents' home, where he now spent his days doing odd chores, and watching classic movies for the first time, over and over.
What she discovered through a series of tests and interviews didn't just contribute greatly to the study of memory.
It redefined what memory even meant.
One of Milner's findings shed light on the obvious fact that although H.M. couldn't form new memories, he still retained information long enough from moment to moment to finish a sentence or find the bathroom.
When Milner gave him a random number, he managed to remember it for fifteen minutes by repeating it to himself constantly.
But only five minutes later, he forgot the test had even taken place.
Neuroscientists had though of memory as monolithic, all of it essentially the same and stored throughout the brain.
Milner's results were not only the first clue for the now familiar distinction between short-term and long-term memory, but show that each uses different brain regions.
We now know that memory formation involves several steps.
After immediate sensory data is temporarily transcribed by neurons in the cortex, it travels to the hippocampus, where special proteins work to strengthen the cortical synaptic connections.
If the experience was strong enough, or we recall it periodically in the first few days, the hippocampus then transfers the memory back to the cortex for permanent storage.
H.M.'s mind could form the initial impressions, but without a hippocampus to perform this memory consolidation, they eroded, like messages scrawled in sand.
But this was not the only memory distinction Milner found.
In a now famous experiment, she asked H.M. to trace a third star in the narrow space between the outlines of two concentric ones while he could only see his paper and pencil through a mirror.
Like anyone else performing such an awkward task for the first time, he did horribly.
But surprisingly, he improved over repeated trials, even though he had no memory of previous attempts.
His unconscious motor centers remembered what the conscious mind had forgotten.
What Milner had discovered was that the declarative memory of names, dates and facts is different from the procedural memory of riding a bicycle or signing your name.
And we now know that procedural memory relies more on the basal ganglia and cerebellum, structures that were intact in H.M.'s brain.
This distinction between "knowing that" and "knowing how" has underpinned all memory research since.
H.M. died at the age of 82 after a mostly peaceful life in a nursing home.
Over the years, he had been examined by more than 100 neuroscientists, making his the most studied mind in history.
Upon his death, his brain was preserved and scanned before being cut into over 2000 individual slices and photographed to form a digital map down to the level of individual neurons, all in a live broadcast watched by 400,000 people.
Though H.M. spent most of his life forgetting things, he and his contributions to our understanding of memory will be remembered for generations to come.
How many times does the chorus repeat in your favorite song?
And, take a moment to think, how many times have you listened to it?
Chances are you've heard that chorus repeated dozens, if not hundreds, of times, and it's not just popular songs in the West that repeat a lot.
Repetition is a feature that music from cultures around the world tends to share.
So, why does music rely so heavily on repetition?
One part of the answer come from what psychologists call the mere-exposure effect.
In short, people tend to prefer things they've been exposed to before.
For example, a song comes on the radio that we don't particularly like, but then we hear the song at the grocery store, at the movie theater and again on the street corner.
Soon, we are tapping to the beat, singing the words, even downloading the track.
This mere-exposure effect doesn't just work for songs.
It also works for everything from shapes to Super Bowl ads.
So, what makes repetition so uniquely prevalent in music?
To investigate, psychologists asked people to listen to musical compositions that avoided exact repetition.
They heard excerpts from these pieces in either their original form, or in a version that had been digitally altered to include repetition.
Although the original versions had been composed by some of the most respected 20th century composers, and the repetitive versions had been assembled by brute force audio editing, people rated the repetitive versions as more enjoyable, more interesting and more likely to have been composed by a human artist.
Musical repetition is deeply compelling.
Think about the Muppets classic, "Mahna Mahna."
If you've heard it before, it's almost impossible after I sing, "Mahna mahna," not to respond, "Do doo do do do."
Repetition connects each bit of music irresistibly to the next bit of music that follows it.
So when you hear a few notes, you're already imagining what's coming next.
Your mind is unconsciously singing along, and without noticing, you might start humming out loud.
Recent studies have shown that when people hear a segment of music repeated, they are more likely to move or tap along to it.
Repetition invites us into music as imagined participants, rather than as passive listeners.
Research has also shown that listeners shift their attention across musical repetitions, focusing on different aspects of the sound on each new listen.
You might notice the melody of a phrase the first time, but when it's repeated, your attention shifts to how the guitarist bends a pitch.
This also occurs in language, with something called semantic satiation.
Repeating a word like atlas ad nauseam can make you stop thinking about what the word means, and instead focus on the sounds: the odd way the "L" follows the "T."
In this way, repetition can open up new worlds of sound not accessible on first hearing.
The "L" following the "T" might not be aesthetically relevant to "atlas," but the guitarist pitch bending might be of critical expressive importance.
The speech to song illusion captures how simply repeating a sentence a number of times shifts listeners attention to the pitch and temporal aspects of the sound, so that the repeated spoken language actually begins to sound like it is being sung.
A similar effect happens with random sequences of sound.
People will rate random sequences they've heard on repeated loop as more musical than a random sequence they've only heard once.
Repetition gives rise to a kind of orientation to sound that we think of as distinctively musical, where we're listening along with the sound, engaging imaginatively with the note about to happen.
This mode of listening ties in with our susceptibility to musical ear worms, where segments of music burrow into our head, and play again and again, as if stuck on repeat.
Critics are often embarrassed by music's repetitiveness, finding it childish or regressive, but repetition, far from an embarrassment, is actually a key feature that gives rise to the kind of experience we think about as musical.
The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is one of a handful of ideas from quantum physics to expand into general pop culture.
It says that you can never simultaneously know the exact position and the exact speed of an object and shows up as a metaphor in everything from literary criticism to sports commentary.
Uncertainty is often explained as a result of measurement, that the act of measuring an object's position changes its speed, or vice versa.
The real origin is much deeper and more amazing.
The Uncertainty Principle exists because everything in the universe behaves like both a particle and a wave at the same time.
In quantum mechanics, the exact position and exact speed of an object have no meaning.
To understand this, we need to think about what it means to behave like a particle or a wave.
Particles, by definition, exist in a single place at any instant in time.
We can represent this by a graph showing the probability of finding the object at a particular place, which looks like a spike, 100% at one specific position, and zero everywhere else.
Waves, on the other hand, are disturbances spread out in space, like ripples covering the surface of a pond.
We can clearly identify features of the wave pattern as a whole, most importantly, its wavelength, which is the distance between two neighboring peaks, or two neighboring valleys.
But we can't assign it a single position.
It has a good probability of being in lots of different places.
Wavelength is essential for quantum physics because an object's wavelength is related to its momentum, mass times velocity.
A fast-moving object has lots of momentum, which corresponds to a very short wavelength.
A heavy object has lots of momentum even if it's not moving very fast, which again means a very short wavelength.
This is why we don't notice the wave nature of everyday objects.
If you toss a baseball up in the air, its wavelength is a billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a meter, far too tiny to ever detect.
Small things, like atoms or electrons though, can have wavelengths big enough to measure in physics experiments.
So, if we have a pure wave, we can measure its wavelength, and thus its momentum, but it has no position.
We can know a particles position very well, but it doesn't have a wavelength, so we don't know its momentum.
To get a particle with both position and momentum, we need to mix the two pictures to make a graph that has waves, but only in a small area.
How can we do this?
By combining waves with different wavelengths, which means giving our quantum object some possibility of having different momenta.
When we add two waves, we find that there are places where the peaks line up, making a bigger wave, and other places where the peaks of one fill in the valleys of the other.
The result has regions where we see waves separated by regions of nothing at all.
If we add a third wave, the regions where the waves cancel out get bigger, a fourth and they get bigger still, with the wavier regions becoming narrower.
If we keep adding waves, we can make a wave packet with a clear wavelength in one small region.
That's a quantum object with both wave and particle nature, but to accomplish this, we had to lose certainty about both position and momentum.
The positions isn't restricted to a single point.
There's a good probability of finding it within some range of the center of the wave packet, and we made the wave packet by adding lots of waves, which means there's some probability of finding it with the momentum corresponding to any one of those.
Both position and momentum are now uncertain, and the uncertainties are connected.
If you want to reduce the position uncertainty by making a smaller wave packet, you need to add more waves, which means a bigger momentum uncertainty.
If you want to know the momentum better, you need a bigger wave packet, which means a bigger position uncertainty.
That's the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, first stated by German physicist Werner Heisenberg back in 1927.
This uncertainty isn't a matter of measuring well or badly, but an inevitable result of combining particle and wave nature.
The Uncertainty Principle isn't just a practical limit on measurment.
It's a limit on what properties an object can have, built into the fundamental structure of the universe itself.
I believe that the secret to producing extremely drought-tolerant crops, which should go some way to providing food security in the world, lies in resurrection plants, pictured here, in an extremely droughted state.
You might think that these plants look dead, but they're not.
Give them water, and they will resurrect, green up, start growing, in 12 to 48 hours.
Now, why would I suggest that producing drought-tolerant crops will go towards providing food security?
Well, the current world population is around 7 billion.
And it's estimated that by 2050, we'll be between 9 and 10 billion people, with the bulk of this growth happening in Africa.
The food and agricultural organizations of the world have suggested that we need a 70 percent increase in current agricultural practice to meet that demand.
Given that plants are at the base of the food chain, most of that's going to have to come from plants.
That percentage of 70 percent does not take into consideration the potential effects of climate change.
This is taken from a study by Dai published in 2011, where he took into consideration all the potential effects of climate change and expressed them -- amongst other things -- increased aridity due to lack of rain or infrequent rain.
The areas in red shown here, are areas that until recently have been very successfully used for agriculture, but cannot anymore because of lack of rainfall.
This is the situation that's predicted to happen in 2050.
Much of Africa, in fact, much of the world, is going to be in trouble.
We're going to have to think of some very smart ways of producing food.
And preferably among them, some drought-tolerant crops.
The other thing to remember about Africa is that most of their agriculture is rainfed.
Now, making drought-tolerant crops is not the easiest thing in the world.
And the reason for this is water.
Water is essential to life on this planet.
All living, actively metabolizing organisms, from microbes to you and I, are comprised predominately of water.
All life reactions happen in water.
And loss of a small amount of water results in death.
You and I are 65 percent water -- we lose one percent of that, we die.
But we can make behavioral changes to avoid that.
Plants can't.
They're stuck in the ground.
And so in the first instance they have a little bit more water than us, about 95 percent water, and they can lose a little bit more than us, like 10 to about 70 percent, depending on the species, but for short periods only.
Most of them will either try to resist or avoid water loss.
So extreme examples of resistors can be found in succulents.
They tend to be small, very attractive, but they hold onto their water at such great cost that they grow extremely slowly.
Examples of avoidance of water loss are found in trees and shrubs.
They send down very deep roots, mine subterranean water supplies and just keep flushing it through them at all times, keeping themselves hydrated.
The one on the right is called a baobab.
It's also called the upside-down tree, simply because the proportion of roots to shoots is so great that it looks like the tree has been planted upside down.
And of course the roots are required for hydration of that plant.
And probably the most common strategy of avoidance is found in annuals.
Annuals make up the bulk of our plant food supplies.
Up the west coast of my country, for much of the year you don't see much vegetation growth.
But come the spring rains, you get this: flowering of the desert.
The strategy in annuals, is to grow only in the rainy season.
At the end of that season they produce a seed, which is dry, eight to 10 percent water, but very much alive.
And anything that is that dry and still alive, we call desiccation-tolerant.
In the desiccated state, what seeds can do is lie in extremes of environment for prolonged periods of time.
The next time the rainy season comes, they germinate and grow, and the whole cycle just starts again.
It's widely believed that the evolution of desiccation-tolerant seeds allowed the colonization and the radiation of flowering plants, or angiosperms, onto land.
But back to annuals as our major form of food supplies.
Wheat, rice and maize form 95 percent of our plant food supplies.
And it's been a great strategy because in a short space of time you can produce a lot of seed.
Seeds are energy-rich so there's a lot of food calories, you can store it in times of plenty for times of famine, but there's a downside.
The vegetative tissues, the roots and leaves of annuals, do not have much by way of inherent resistance, avoidance or tolerance characteristics.
They just don't need them.
They grow in the rainy season and they've got a seed to help them survive the rest of the year.
And so despite concerted efforts in agriculture to make crops with improved properties of resistance, avoidance and tolerance -- particularly resistance and avoidance because we've had good models to understand how those work -- we still get images like this.
Maize crop in Africa, two weeks without rain and it's dead.
There is a solution: resurrection plants.
These plants can lose 95 percent of their cellular water, remain in a dry, dead-like state for months to years, and give them water, they green up and start growing again.
Like seeds, these are desiccation-tolerant.
Like seeds, these can withstand extremes of environmental conditions.
And this is a really rare phenomenon.
There are only 135 flowering plant species that can do this.
I'm going to show you a video of the resurrection process of these three species in that order.
And at the bottom, there's a time axis so you can see how quickly it happens.
(Applause) Pretty amazing, huh?
So I've spent the last 21 years trying to understand how they do this.
How do these plants dry without dying?
And I work on a variety of different resurrection plants, shown here in the hydrated and dry states, for a number of reasons.
One of them is that each of these plants serves as a model for a crop that I'd like to make drought-tolerant.
So on the extreme top left, for example, is a grass, it's called Eragrostis nindensis, it's got a close relative called Eragrostis tef -- a lot of you might know it as "teff" -- it's a staple food in Ethiopia, it's gluten-free, and it's something we would like to make drought-tolerant.
The other reason for looking at a number of plants, is that, at least initially, I wanted to find out: do they do the same thing?
Do they all use the same mechanisms to be able to lose all that water and not die?
So I undertook what we call a systems biology approach in order to get a comprehensive understanding of desiccation tolerance, in which we look at everything from the molecular to the whole plant, ecophysiological level.
For example we look at things like changes in the plant anatomy as they dried out and their ultrastructure.
We look at the transcriptome, which is just a term for a technology in which we look at the genes that are switched on or off, in response to drying.
Most genes will code for proteins, so we look at the proteome.
What are the proteins made in response to drying?
Some proteins would code for enzymes which make metabolites, so we look at the metabolome.
Now, this is important because plants are stuck in the ground.
They use what I call a highly tuned chemical arsenal to protect themselves from all the stresses of their environment.
So it's important that we look at the chemical changes involved in drying.
And at the last study that we do at the molecular level, we look at the lipidome -- the lipid changes in response to drying.
And that's also important because all biological membranes are made of lipids.
They're held as membranes because they're in water.
Take away the water, those membranes fall apart.
Lipids also act as signals to turn on genes.
Then we use physiological and biochemical studies to try and understand the function of the putative protectants that we've actually discovered in our other studies.
And then use all of that to try and understand how the plant copes with its natural environment.
I've always had the philosophy that I needed a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance in order to make a meaningful suggestion for a biotic application.
I'm sure some of you are thinking, "By biotic application, does she mean she's going to make genetically modified crops?"
And the answer to that question is: depends on your definition of genetic modification.
All of the crops that we eat today, wheat, rice and maize, are highly genetically modified from their ancestors, but we don't consider them GM because they're being produced by conventional breeding.
If you mean, am I going to put resurrection plant genes into crops, your answer is yes.
In the essence of time, we have tried that approach.
More appropriately, some of my collaborators at UCT, Jennifer Thomson, Suhail Rafudeen, have spearheaded that approach and I'm going to show you some data soon.
But we're about to embark upon an extremely ambitious approach, in which we aim to turn on whole suites of genes that are already present in every crop.
They're just never turned on under extreme drought conditions.
I leave it up to you to decide whether those should be called GM or not.
I'm going to now just give you some of the data from that first approach.
And in order to do that I have to explain a little bit about how genes work.
So you probably all know that genes are made of double-stranded DNA.
It's wound very tightly into chromosomes that are present in every cell of your body or in a plant's body.
If you unwind that DNA, you get genes.
And each gene has a promoter, which is just an on-off switch, the gene coding region, and then a terminator, which indicates that this is the end of this gene, the next gene will start.
Now, promoters are not simple on-off switches.
They normally require a lot of fine-tuning, lots of things to be present and correct before that gene is switched on.
So what's typically done in biotech studies is that we use an inducible promoter, we know how to switch it on.
We couple that to genes of interest and put that into a plant and see how the plant responds.
In the study that I'm going to talk to you about, my collaborators used a drought-induced promoter, which we discovered in a resurrection plant.
The nice thing about this promoter is that we do nothing.
The plant itself senses drought.
And we've used it to drive antioxidant genes from resurrection plants.
Why antioxidant genes?
Well, all stresses, particularly drought stress, results in the formation of free radicals, or reactive oxygen species, which are highly damaging and can cause crop death.
What antioxidants do is stop that damage.
So here's some data from a maize strain that's very popularly used in Africa.
To the left of the arrow are plants without the genes, to the right -- plants with the antioxidant genes.
After three weeks without watering, the ones with the genes do a hell of a lot better.
Now to the final approach.
My research has shown that there's considerable similarity in the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance in seeds and resurrection plants.
So I ask the question, are they using the same genes?
Or slightly differently phrased, are resurrection plants using genes evolved in seed desiccation tolerance in their roots and leaves?
Have they retasked these seed genes in roots and leaves of resurrection plants?
And I answer that question, as a consequence of a lot of research from my group and recent collaborations from a group of Henk Hilhorst in the Netherlands, Mel Oliver in the United States and Julia Buitink in France.
The answer is yes, that there is a core set of genes that are involved in both.
And I'm going to illustrate this very crudely for maize, where the chromosomes below the off switch represent all the genes that are required for desiccation tolerance.
So as maize seeds dried out at the end of their period of development, they switch these genes on.
Resurrection plants switch on the same genes when they dry out.
All modern crops, therefore, have these genes in their roots and leaves, they just never switch them on.
They only switch them on in seed tissues.
So what we're trying to do right now is to understand the environmental and cellular signals that switch on these genes in resurrection plants, to mimic the process in crops.
And just a final thought.
What we're trying to do very rapidly is to repeat what nature did in the evolution of resurrection plants some 10 to 40 million years ago.
My plants and I thank you for your attention.

Sadness is part of the human experience, but for centuries there has been vast disagreement over what exactly it is and what, if anything, to do about it.
In its simplest terms, sadness is often thought of as the natural reaction to a difficult situation.
You feel sad when a friend moves away or when a pet dies.
When a friend says, "I'm sad," you often respond by asking, "What happened?"
But your assumption that sadness has an external cause outside the self is a relatively new idea.
Ancient Greek doctors didn't view sadness that way.
They believed it was a dark fluid inside the body.
According to their humoral system, the human body and soul were controlled by four fluids, known as humors, and their balance directly influenced a person's health and temperament.
Melancholia comes from melaina kole, the word for black bile, the humor believed to cause sadness.
By changing your diet and through medical practices, you could bring your humors into balance.
Even though we now know much more about the systems that govern the human body, these Greek ideas about sadness resonate with current views, not on the sadness we all occasionally feel, but on clinical depression.
Doctors believe that certain kinds of long-term, unexplained emotional states are at least partially related to brain chemistry, the balance of various chemicals present inside the brain.
Like the Greek system, changing the balance of these chemicals can deeply alter how we respond to even extremely difficult circumstances.
There's also a long tradition of attempting to discern the value of sadness, and in that discussion, you'll find a strong argument that sadness is not only an inevitable part of life but an essential one.
If you've never felt melancholy, you've missed out on part of what it means to be human.
Many thinkers contend that melancholy is necessary in gaining wisdom.
Robert Burton, born in 1577, spent his life studying the causes and experience of sadness.
In his masterpiece "The Anatomy of Melancholy," Burton wrote, "He that increaseth wisdom increaseth sorrow."
The Romantic poets of the early 19th century believed melancholy allows us to more deeply understand other profound emotions, like beauty and joy.
To understand the sadness of the trees losing their leaves in the fall is to more fully understand the cycle of life that brings flowers in the spring.
But wisdom and emotional intelligence seem pretty high on the hierarchy of needs.
Does sadness have value on a more basic, tangible, maybe even evolutionary level?
Scientists think that crying and feeling withdrawn is what originally helped our ancestors secure social bonds and helped them get the support they needed.
Sadness, as opposed to anger or violence, was an expression of suffering that could immediately bring people closer to the suffering person, and this helped both the person and the larger community to thrive.
Perhaps sadness helped generate the unity we needed to survive, but many have wondered whether the suffering felt by others is anything like the suffering we experience ourselves.
The poet Emily Dickinson wrote, "I measure every Grief I meet With narrow, probing Eyes - I wonder if it weighs like MIne - Or has an Easier size."
And in the 20th century, medical anthropologists, like Arthur Kleinman, gathered evidence from the way people talk about pain to suggest that emotions aren't universal at all, and that culture, particularly the way we use language, can influence how we feel.
When we talk about heartbreak, the feeling of brokenness becomes part of our experience, where as in a culture that talks about a bruised heart, there actually seems to be a different subjective experience.
Some contemporary thinkers aren't interested in sadness' subjectivity versus universality, and would rather use technology to eliminate suffering in all its forms.
David Pearce has suggested that genetic engineering and other contemporary processes cannot only alter the way humans experience emotional and physical pain, but that world ecosystems ought to be redesigned so that animals don't suffer in the wild.
He calls his project "paradise engineering."
But is there something sad about a world without sadness?
Our cavemen ancestors and favorite poets might not want any part of such a paradise.
In fact, the only things about sadness that seem universally agreed upon are that it has been felt by most people throughout time, and that for thousands of years, one of the best ways we have to deal with this difficult emotion is to articulate it, to try to express what feels inexpressable.
In the words of Emily Dickinson, "'Hope' is the thing with feathers - That perches in the soul - "And sings the tune without the words - And never stops - at all -"
Democracy.
In the West, we make a colossal mistake taking it for granted.
We see democracy not as the most fragile of flowers that it really is, but we see it as part of our society's furniture.
We tend to think of it as an intransigent given.
We mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy.
It doesn't.
Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew and his great imitators in Beijing have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that it is perfectly possible to have a flourishing capitalism, spectacular growth, while politics remains democracy-free.
Indeed, democracy is receding in our neck of the woods, here in Europe.
Earlier this year, while I was representing Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- in the Eurogroup as its Finance Minister, I was told in no uncertain terms that our nation's democratic process -- our elections -- could not be allowed to interfere with economic policies that were being implemented in Greece.
At that moment, I felt that there could be no greater vindication of Lee Kuan Yew, or the Chinese Communist Party, indeed of some recalcitrant friends of mine who kept telling me that democracy would be banned if it ever threatened to change anything.
Tonight, here, I want to present to you an economic case for an authentic democracy.
I want to ask you to join me in believing again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Chinese Communist Party and indeed the Eurogroup are wrong in believing that we can dispense with democracy -- that we need an authentic, boisterous democracy.
And without democracy, our societies will be nastier, our future bleak and our great, new technologies wasted.
Speaking of waste, allow me to point out an interesting paradox that is threatening our economies as we speak.
I call it the twin peaks paradox.
One peak you understand -- you know it, you recognize it -- is the mountain of debts that has been casting a long shadow over the United States, Europe, the whole world.
We all recognize the mountain of debts.
But few people discern its twin.
A mountain of idle cash belonging to rich savers and to corporations, too terrified to invest it into the productive activities that can generate the incomes from which you can extinguish the mountain of debts and which can produce all those things that humanity desperately needs, like green energy.
Now let me give you two numbers.
Over the last three months, in the United States, in Britain and in the Eurozone, we have invested, collectively, 3.4 trillion dollars on all the wealth-producing goods -- things like industrial plants, machinery, office blocks, schools, roads, railways, machinery, and so on and so forth.
$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money until you compare it to the $5.1 trillion that has been slushing around in the same countries, in our financial institutions, doing absolutely nothing during the same period except inflating stock exchanges and bidding up house prices.
So a mountain of debt and a mountain of idle cash form twin peaks, failing to cancel each other out through the normal operation of the markets.
The result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of 25- to 54-year-olds in America, in Japan and in Europe out of work.
And consequently, low aggregate demand, which in a never-ending cycle, reinforces the pessimism of the investors, who, fearing low demand, reproduce it by not investing -- exactly like Oedipus' father, who, terrified by the prophecy of the oracle that his son would grow up to kill him, unwittingly engineered the conditions that ensured that Oedipus, his son, would kill him.
This is my quarrel with capitalism.
Its gross wastefulness, all this idle cash, should be energized to improve lives, to develop human talents, and indeed to finance all these technologies, green technologies, which are absolutely essential for saving planet Earth.
Am I right in believing that democracy might be the answer?
I believe so, but before we move on, what do we mean by democracy?
Aristotle defined democracy as the constitution in which the free and the poor, being in the majority, control government.
Now, of course Athenian democracy excluded too many.
Women, migrants and, of course, the slaves.
But it would be a mistake to dismiss the significance of ancient Athenian democracy on the basis of whom it excluded.
What was more pertinent, and continues to be so about ancient Athenian democracy, was the inclusion of the working poor, who not only acquired the right to free speech, but more importantly, crucially, they acquired the rights to political judgments that were afforded equal weight in the decision-making concerning matters of state.
Now, of course, Athenian democracy didn't last long.
Like a candle that burns brightly, it burned out quickly.
And indeed, our liberal democracies today do not have their roots in ancient Athens.
They have their roots in the Magna Carta, in the 1688 Glorious Revolution, indeed in the American constitution.
Whereas Athenian democracy was focusing on the masterless citizen and empowering the working poor, our liberal democracies are founded on the Magna Carta tradition, which was, after all, a charter for masters.
And indeed, liberal democracy only surfaced when it was possible to separate fully the political sphere from the economic sphere, so as to confine the democratic process fully in the political sphere, leaving the economic sphere -- the corporate world, if you want -- as a democracy-free zone.
Now, in our democracies today, this separation of the economic from the political sphere, the moment it started happening, it gave rise to an inexorable, epic struggle between the two, with the economic sphere colonizing the political sphere, eating into its power.
Have you wondered why politicians are not what they used to be?
It's not because their DNA has degenerated.
(Laughter) It is rather because one can be in government today and not in power, because power has migrated from the political to the economic sphere, which is separate.
Indeed, I spoke about my quarrel with capitalism.
If you think about it, it is a little bit like a population of predators, that are so successful in decimating the prey that they must feed on, that in the end they starve.
Similarly, the economic sphere has been colonizing and cannibalizing the political sphere to such an extent that it is undermining itself, causing economic crisis.
Corporate power is increasing, political goods are devaluing, inequality is rising, aggregate demand is falling and CEOs of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their corporations.
So the more capitalism succeeds in taking the demos out of democracy, the taller the twin peaks and the greater the waste of human resources and humanity's wealth.
Clearly, if this is right, we must reunite the political and economic spheres and better do it with a demos being in control, like in ancient Athens except without the slaves or the exclusion of women and migrants.
Now, this is not an original idea.
The Marxist left had that idea 100 years ago and it didn't go very well, did it?
The lesson that we learned from the Soviet debacle is that only by a miracle will the working poor be reempowered, as they were in ancient Athens, without creating new forms of brutality and waste.
But there is a solution: eliminate the working poor.
Capitalism's doing it by replacing low-wage workers with automata, androids, robots.
The problem is that as long as the economic and the political spheres are separate, automation makes the twin peaks taller, the waste loftier and the social conflicts deeper, including -- soon, I believe -- in places like China.
So we need to reconfigure, we need to reunite the economic and the political spheres, but we'd better do it by democratizing the reunified sphere, lest we end up with a surveillance-mad hyperautocracy that makes The Matrix, the movie, look like a documentary.
(Laughter) So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technological innovations it is spawning.
The more interesting question is whether capitalism will be succeeded by something resembling a Matrix dystopia or something much closer to a Star Trek-like society, where machines serve the humans and the humans expend their energies exploring the universe and indulging in long debates about the meaning of life in some ancient, Athenian-like, high tech agora.
I think we can afford to be optimistic.
But what would it take, what would it look like to have this Star Trek-like utopia, instead of the Matrix-like dystopia?
In practical terms, allow me to share just briefly, a couple of examples.
At the level of the enterprise, imagine a capital market, where you earn capital as you work, and where your capital follows you from one job to another, from one company to another, and the company -- whichever one you happen to work at at that time -- is solely owned by those who happen to work in it at that moment.
Then all income stems from capital, from profits, and the very concept of wage labor becomes obsolete.
No more separation between those who own but do not work in the company and those who work but do not own the company; no more tug-of-war between capital and labor; no great gap between investment and saving; indeed, no towering twin peaks.
At the level of the global political economy, imagine for a moment that our national currencies have a free-floating exchange rate, with a universal, global, digital currency, one that is issued by the International Monetary Fund, the G-20, on behalf of all humanity.
And imagine further that all international trade is denominated in this currency -- let's call it "the cosmos," in units of cosmos -- with every government agreeing to be paying into a common fund a sum of cosmos units proportional to the country's trade deficit, or indeed to a country's trade surplus.
And imagine that that fund is utilized to invest in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funding is scarce.
This is not a new idea.
It's what, effectively, John Maynard Keynes proposed in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference.
The problem is that back then, they didn't have the technology to implement it.
Now we do, especially in the context of a reunified political-economic sphere.
The world that I am describing to you is simultaneously libertarian, in that it prioritizes empowered individuals, Marxist, since it will have confined to the dustbin of history the division between capital and labor, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.
But above all else, it is a world in which we will be able to imagine an authentic democracy.
Will such a world dawn?
Or shall we descend into a Matrix-like dystopia?
The answer lies in the political choice that we shall be making collectively.
It is our choice, and we'd better make it democratically.
Thank you.
(Applause) Bruno Giussani: Yanis ...
It was you who described yourself in your bios as a libertarian Marxist.
What is the relevance of Marx's analysis today?
Yanis Varoufakis: Well, if there was any relevance in what I just said, then Marx is relevant.
Because the whole point of reunifying the political and economic is -- if we don't do it, then technological innovation is going to create such a massive fall in aggregate demand, what Larry Summers refers to as secular stagnation.
With this crisis migrating from one part of the world, as it is now, it will destabilize not only our democracies, but even the emerging world that is not that keen on liberal democracy.
So if this analysis holds water, then Marx is absolutely relevant.
But so is Hayek, that's why I'm a libertarian Marxist, and so is Keynes, so that's why I'm totally confused.
(Laughter) BG: Indeed, and possibly we are too, now.
(Laughter) (Applause) YV: If you are not confused, you are not thinking, OK?
BG: That's a very, very Greek philosopher kind of thing to say -- YV: That was Einstein, actually -- BG: During your talk you mentioned Singapore and China, and last night at the speaker dinner, you expressed a pretty strong opinion about how the West looks at China.
Would you like to share that?
YV: Well, there's a great degree of hypocrisy.
In our liberal democracies, we have a semblance of democracy.
It's because we have confined, as I was saying in my talk, democracy to the political sphere, while leaving the one sphere where all the action is -- the economic sphere -- a completely democracy-free zone.
In a sense, if I am allowed to be provocative, China today is closer to Britain in the 19th century.
Because remember, we tend to associate liberalism with democracy -- that's a mistake, historically.
Liberalism, liberal, it's like John Stuart Mill.
John Stuart Mill was particularly skeptical about the democratic process.
So what you are seeing now in China is a very similar process to the one that we had in Britain during the Industrial Revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.
And to be castigating China for doing that which the West did in the 19th century, smacks of hypocrisy.
BG: I am sure that many people here are wondering about your experience as the Finance Minister of Greece earlier this year.
YV: I knew this was coming.
BG: Yes.
BG: Six months after, how do you look back at the first half of the year?
YV: Extremely exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had an opportunity to reboot the Eurozone.
Not just Greece, the Eurozone.
To move away from the complacency and the constant denial that there was a massive -- and there is a massive architectural fault line going through the Eurozone, which is threatening, massively, the whole of the European Union process.
We had an opportunity on the basis of the Greek program -- which by the way, was the first program to manifest that denial -- to put it right.
And, unfortunately, the powers in the Eurozone, in the Eurogroup, chose to maintain denial.
But you know what happens.
This is the experience of the Soviet Union.
When you try to keep alive an economic system that architecturally cannot survive, through political will and through authoritarianism, you may succeed in prolonging it, but when change happens it happens very abruptly and catastrophically.
BG: What kind of change are you foreseeing?
YV: Well, there's no doubt that if we don't change the architecture of the Eurozone, the Eurozone has no future.
BG: Did you make any mistakes when you were Finance Minister?
YV: Every day.
BG: For example? YV: Anybody who looks back -- (Applause) No, but seriously.
If there's any Minister of Finance, or of anything else for that matter, who tells you after six months in a job, especially in such a stressful situation, that they have made no mistake, they're dangerous people.
Of course I made mistakes.
The greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of a loan agreement in the end of February.
I was imagining that there was a genuine interest on the side of the creditors to find common ground.
And there wasn't.
They were simply interested in crushing our government, just because they did not want to have to deal with the architectural fault lines that were running through the Eurozone.
And because they didn't want to admit that for five years they were implementing a catastrophic program in Greece.
We lost one-third of our nominal GDP.
This is worse than the Great Depression.
And no one has come clean from the troika of lenders that have been imposing this policy to say, "This was a colossal mistake."
BG: Despite all this, and despite the aggressiveness of the discussion, you seem to be remaining quite pro-European.
YV: Absolutely.
Look, my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from a person who lives and breathes Europe.
My greatest fear is that the Eurozone will not survive.
Because if it doesn't, the centrifugal forces that will be unleashed will be demonic, and they will destroy the European Union.
And that will be catastrophic not just for Europe but for the whole global economy.
We are probably the largest economy in the world.
And if we allow ourselves to fall into a route of the postmodern 1930's, which seems to me to be what we are doing, then that will be detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans alike.
BG: We definitely hope you are wrong on that point.
Yanis, thank you for coming to TED.
YV: Thank you.
(Applause)
Many people in the United States and Latin America have grown up celebrating the anniversary of Christopher Columbus's voyage, but was he an intrepid explorer who brought two worlds together or a ruthless exploiter who brought colonialism and slavery?
And did he even discover America at all?
It's time to put Columbus on the stand in History vs. Christopher Columbus.
"Order, order in the court.
Wait, am I even supposed to be at work today?"
<i>Cough</i> "Yes, your Honor.
From 1792, Columbus Day was celebrated in many parts of the United States on October 12th, the actual anniversary date.
But although it was declared an official holiday in 1934, individual states aren't required to observe it.
Only 23 states close public services, and more states are moving away from it completely."
<i>Cough</i> "What a pity.
In the 70s, we even moved it to the second Monday in October so people could get a nice three-day weekend, but I guess you folks just hate celebrations."
"Uh, what are we celebrating again?"
"Come on, Your Honor, we all learned it in school.
Christopher Columbus convinced the King of Spain to send him on a mission to find a better trade route to India, not by going East over land but sailing West around the globe.
Everyone said it was crazy because they still thought the world was flat, but he knew better.
And when in 1492 he sailed the ocean blue, he found something better than India: a whole new continent."
"What rubbish.
First of all, educated people knew the world was round since Aristotle.
Secondly, Columbus didn't discover anything.
There were already people living here for millennia.
And he wasn't even the first European to visit.
The Norse had settled Newfoundland almost 500 years before."
"You don't say, so how come we're not all wearing those cow helmets?"
"Actually, they didn't really wear those either."
<i>Cough</i> "Who cares what some Vikings did way back when?
Those settlements didn't last, but Columbus's did.
And the news he brought back to Europe spread far and wide, inspiring all the explorers and settlers who came after.
Without him, none of us would be here today."
"And because of him, millions of Native Americans aren't here today.
Do you know what Columbus did in the colonies he founded?
He took the very first natives he met prisoner and wrote in his journal about how easily he could conquer and enslave all of them."
"Oh, come on. Everyone was fighting each other back then.
Didn't the natives even tell Columbus about other tribes raiding and taking captives?"
"Yes, but tribal warfare was sporadic and limited.
It certainly didn't wipe out 90% of the population."
"Hmm. Why is celebrating this Columbus so important to you, anyway?"
"Your Honor, Columbus's voyage was an inspiration to struggling people all across Europe, symbolizing freedom and new beginnings.
And his discovery gave our grandparents and great-grandparents the chance to come here and build better lives for their children.
Don't we deserve a hero to remind everyone that our country was build on the struggles of immigrants?"
"And what about the struggles of Native Americans who were nearly wiped out and forced into reservations and whose descendants still suffer from poverty and discrimination?
How can you make a hero out of a man who caused so much suffering?"
"That's history. You can't judge a guy in the 15th century by modern standards.
People back then even thought spreading Christianity and civilization across the world was a moral duty."
"Actually, he was pretty bad, even by old standards.
While governing Hispaniola, he tortured and mutilated natives who didn't bring him enough gold and sold girls as young as nine into sexual slavery, and he was brutal even to the other colonists he ruled, to the point that he was removed from power and thrown in jail.
When the missionary, Bartolomé de las Casas, visited the island, he wrote, 'From 1494 to 1508, over 3,000,000 people had perished from war, slavery and the mines. Who in future generations will believe this?'" "Well, I'm not sure I believe those numbers."
"Say, aren't there other ways the holiday is celebrated?"
"In some Latin American countries, they celebrate the same date under different names, such as Día de la Raza.
In these places, it's more a celebration of the native and mixed cultures that survived through the colonial period.
Some places in the U.S. have also renamed the holiday, as Native American Day or Indigenous People's Day and changed the celebrations accordingly."
"So, why not just change the name if it's such a problem?"
"Because it's tradition.
Ordinary people need their heroes and their founding myths.
Can't we just keep celebrating the way we've been doing for a century, without having to delve into all this serious research?
It's not like anyone is actually celebrating genocide."
"Traditions change, and the way we choose to keep them alive says a lot about our values."
"Well, it looks like giving tired judges a day off isn't one of those values, anyway."
Traditions and holidays are important to all cultures, but a hero in one era may become a villain in the next as our historical knowledge expands and our values evolve.
And deciding what these traditions should mean today is a major part of putting history on trial.
Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger is one of the founders of quantum mechanics, but he's most famous for something he never actually did: a thought experiment involving a cat.
He imagined taking a cat and placing it in a sealed box with a device that had a 50% chance of killing the cat in the next hour.
At the end of that hour, he asked, "What is the state of the cat?"
Common sense suggests that the cat is either alive or dead, but Schrödinger pointed out that according to quantum physics, at the instant before the box is opened, the cat is equal parts alive and dead, at the same time.
It's only when the box is opened that we see a single definite state.
Until then, the cat is a blur of probability, half one thing and half the other.
This seems absurd, which was Schrödinger's point.
He found quantum physics so philosophically disturbing, that he abandoned the theory he had helped make and turned to writing about biology.
As absurd as it may seem, though, Schrödinger's cat is very real.
In fact, it's essential.
If it weren't possible for quantum objects to be in two states at once, the computer you're using to watch this couldn't exist.
The quantum phenomenon of superposition is a consequence of the dual particle and wave nature of everything.
In order for an object to have a wavelength, it must extend over some region of space, which means it occupies many positions at the same time.
The wavelength of an object limited to a small region of space can't be perfectly defined, though.
So it exists in many different wavelengths at the same time.
We don't see these wave properties for everyday objects because the wavelength decreases as the momentum increases.
And a cat is relatively big and heavy.
If we took a single atom and blew it up to the size of the Solar System, the wavelength of a cat running from a physicist would be as small as an atom within that Solar System.
That's far too small to detect, so we'll never see wave behavior from a cat.
A tiny particle, like an electron, though, can show dramatic evidence of its dual nature.
If we shoot electrons one at a time at a set of two narrow slits cut in a barrier, each electron on the far side is detected at a single place at a specific instant, like a particle.
But if you repeat this experiment many times, keeping track of all the individual detections, you'll see them trace out a pattern that's characteristic of wave behavior: a set of stripes - regions with many electrons separated by regions where there are none at all.
Block one of the slits and the stripes go away.
This shows that the pattern is a result of each electron going through both slits at the same time.
A single electron isn't choosing to go left or right but left and right simultaneously.
This superposition of states also leads to modern technology.
An electron near the nucleus of an atom exists in a spread out, wave-like orbit.
Bring two atoms close together, and the electrons don't need to choose just one atom but are shared between them.
This is how some chemical bonds form.
An electron in a molecule isn't on just atom A or atom B, but A+ B.
As you add more atoms, the electrons spread out more, shared between vast numbers of atoms at the same time.
The electrons in a solid aren't bound to a particular atom but shared among all of them, extending over a large range of space.
This gigantic superposition of states determines the ways electrons move through the material, whether it's a conductor or an insulator or a semiconductor.
Understanding how electrons are shared among atoms allows us to precisely control the properties of semiconductor materials, like silicon.
Combining different semiconductors in the right way allows us to make transistors on a tiny scale, millions on a single computer chip.
Those chips and their spread out electrons power the computer you're using to watch this video.
An old joke says that the Internet exists to allow the sharing of cat videos.
At a very deep level, though, the Internet owes its existance to an Austrian physicist and his imaginary cat.
We usually think of rhythm as an element of music, but it's actually found everywhere in the world around us, from the ocean tides to our own heartbeats, rhythm is essentially an event repeating regularly over time.
Even the ticking of a clock itself is a sort of rhythm.
But for musical rhythm, a steady string of repeating single beats is not enough.
For that, we need at least one opposing beat with a different sound, which can be the unstressed off beat or the accented back beat.
There are several ways to make these beats distinct, whether by using high and low drums, or long and short beats.
Which ends up being heard as the main beat is not a precise rule, but like the famous Rubin's vase, can be reversed depending on cultural perception.
In standard notation, rhythm is indicated on a musical bar line, but there are other ways.
Remember that ticking clock?
Just as its round face can trace the linear passage of time, the flow of rhythm can be traced in a circle.
The continuity of a wheel can be a more intuitive way to visualize rhythm than a linear score that requires moving back and forth along the page.
We can mark the beats at different positions around the circle using blue dots for main beats, orange ones for off beats, and white dots for secondary beats.
Here is a basic two beat rhythm with a main beat and an opposing off beat.
Or a three beat rhythm with a main beat, an off beat, and a secondary beat.
And the spaces between each beat can be divided into further sub-beats using multiples of either two or three.
Layering multiple patterns using concentric wheels lets us create more complex rhythms.
For example, we can combine a basic two beat rhythm with off beats to get a four beat system.
This is the recognizable backbone of many genres popular around the world, from rock, country, and jazz, to reggae and cumbia.
Or we can combine a two beat rhythm with a three beat one.
Eliminating the extra main beat and rotating the inner wheel leaves us with a rhythm whose underlying feel is three-four.
This is the basis of the music of Whirling Dervishes, as well as a broad range of Latin American rhythms, such as Joropo, and even Bach's famous Chaconne.
Now if we remember Rubin's vase and hear the off beats as the main beats, this will give us a six-eight feel, as found in genres such as Chacarera, and Quechua, Persian music and more.
In an eight beat system, we have three layered circles, each rhythm played by a different instrument.
We can then add an outermost layer consisting of an additive rhythmic component, reinforcing the main beat and increasing accuracy.
Now let's remove everything except for this combined rhythm and the basic two beat on top.
This rhythmic configuration is found as the Cuban cinquillo, in the Puerto Rican bomba, and in Northern Romanian music.
And rotating the outer circle 90 degrees counterclockwise gives us a pattern often found in Middle Eastern music, as well as Brazilian choro, and Argentinian tango.
In all of these examples, the underlying rhythm reinforces the basic one-two, but in different ways depending on arrangement and cultural context.
So it turns out that the wheel method is more than just a nifty way of visualizing complex rhythms.
By freeing us from the tyranny of the bar line, we can visualize rhythm in terms of time, and a simple turn of the wheel can take us on a musical journey around the world.
Would mathematics exist if people didn't?
Since ancient times, mankind has hotly debated whether mathematics was discovered or invented.
Did we create mathematical concepts to help us understand the universe around us, or is math the native language of the universe itself, existing whether we find its truths or not?
Are numbers, polygons and equations truly real, or merely ethereal representations of some theoretical ideal?
The independent reality of math has some ancient advocates.
The Pythagoreans of 5th Century Greece believed numbers were both living entities and universal principles.
They called the number one, "the monad," the generator of all other numbers and source of all creation.
Numbers were active agents in nature.
Plato argued mathematical concepts were concrete and as real as the universe itself, regardless of our knowledge of them.
Euclid, the father of geometry, believed nature itself was the physical manifestation of mathematical laws.
Others argue that while numbers may or may not exist physically, mathematical statements definitely don't.
Their truth values are based on rules that humans created.
Mathematics is thus an invented logic exercise, with no existence outside mankind's conscious thought, a language of abstract relationships based on patterns discerned by brains, built to use those patterns to invent useful but artificial order from chaos.
One proponent of this sort of idea was Leopold Kronecker, a professor of mathematics in 19th century Germany.
His belief is summed up in his famous statement: "God created the natural numbers, all else is the work of man."
During mathematician David Hilbert's lifetime, there was a push to establish mathematics as a logical construct.
Hilbert attempted to axiomatize all of mathematics, as Euclid had done with geometry.
He and others who attempted this saw mathematics as a deeply philosophical game but a game nonetheless.
Henri Poincaré, one of the father's of non-Euclidean geometry, believed that the existence of non-Euclidean geometry, dealing with the non-flat surfaces of hyperbolic and elliptical curvatures, proved that Euclidean geometry, the long standing geometry of flat surfaces, was not a universal truth, but rather one outcome of using one particular set of game rules.
But in 1960, Nobel Physics laureate Eugene Wigner coined the phrase, "the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics," pushing strongly for the idea that mathematics is real and discovered by people.
Wigner pointed out that many purely mathematical theories developed in a vacuum, often with no view towards describing any physical phenomena, have proven decades or even centuries later, to be the framework necessary to explain how the universe has been working all along.
For instance, the number theory of British mathematician Gottfried Hardy, who had boasted that none of his work would ever be found useful in describing any phenomena in the real world, helped establish cryptography.
Another piece of his purely theoretical work became known as the Hardy-Weinberg law in genetics, and won a Nobel prize.
And Fibonacci stumbled upon his famous sequence while looking at the growth of an idealized rabbit population.
Mankind later found the sequence everywhere in nature, from sunflower seeds and flower petal arrangements, to the structure of a pineapple, even the branching of bronchi in the lungs.
Or there's the non-Euclidean work of Bernhard Riemann in the 1850s, which Einstein used in the model for general relativity a century later.
Here's an even bigger jump: mathematical knot theory, first developed around 1771 to describe the geometry of position, was used in the late 20th century to explain how DNA unravels itself during the replication process.
It may even provide key explanations for string theory.
Some of the most influential mathematicians and scientists of all of human history have chimed in on the issue as well, often in surprising ways.
So, is mathematics an invention or a discovery?
Artificial construct or universal truth?
Human product or natural, possibly divine, creation?
These questions are so deep the debate often becomes spiritual in nature.
The answer might depend on the specific concept being looked at, but it can all feel like a distorted zen koan.
If there's a number of trees in a forest, but no one's there to count them, does that number exist?
"Sorry, my phone died."
"It's nothing. I'm fine."
"These allegations are completely unfounded."
"The company was not aware of any wrongdoing."
"I love you."
We hear anywhere from 10 to 200 lies a day, and we spent much of our history coming up with ways to detect them, from medieval torture devices to polygraphs, blood-pressure and breathing monitors, voice-stress analyzers, eye trackers, infrared brain scanners, and even the 400-pound electroencephalogram.
But although such tools have worked under certain circumstances, most can be fooled with enough preparation, and none are considered reliable enough to even be admissible in court.
But, what if the problem is not with the techniques, but the underlying assumption that lying spurs physiological changes?
What if we took a more direct approach, using communication science to analyze the lies themselves?
On a psychological level, we lie partly to paint a better picture of ourselves, connecting our fantasies to the person we wish we were rather than the person we are.
But while our brain is busy dreaming, it's letting plenty of signals slip by.
Our conscious mind only controls about 5% of our cognitive function, including communication, while the other 95% occurs beyond our awareness, and according to the literature on reality monitoring, stories based on imagined experiences are qualitatively different from those based on real experiences.
This suggests that creating a false story about a personal topic takes work and results in a different pattern of language use.
A technology known as linguistic text analysis has helped to identify four such common patterns in the subconscious language of deception.
First, liars reference themselves less, when making deceptive statements.
They write or talk more about others, often using the third person to distance and disassociate themselves from their lie, which sounds more false: "Absolutely no party took place at this house," or "I didn't host a party here."
Second, liars tend to be more negative, because on a subconscious level, they feel guilty about lying.
For example, a liar might say something like, "Sorry, my stupid phone battery died. I hate that thing."
Third, liars typically explain events in simple terms since our brains struggle to build a complex lie.
Judgment and evaluation are complex things for our brains to compute.
As a U.S. President once famously insisted: "I did not have sexual relations with that woman."
And finally, even though liars keep descriptions simple, they tend to use longer and more convoluted sentence structure, inserting unnecessary words and irrelevant but factual sounding details in order to pad the lie.
Another President confronted with a scandal proclaimed: "I can say, categorically, that this investigation indicates that no one on the White House staff, no one in this administration presently employed was involved in this very bizarre incident."
Let's apply linguistic analysis to some famous examples.
Take seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong.
When comparing a 2005 interview, in which he had denied taking performance-enhancing drugs to a 2013 interview, in which he admitted it, his use of personal pronouns increased by nearly 3/4.
Note the contrast between the following two quotes.
First: "Okay, you know, a guy in a French, in a Parisian laboratory opens up your sample, you know, Jean-Francis so-and-so, and he tests it.
And then you get a phone call from a newspaper that says: 'We found you to be positive six times for EPO."
Second: "I lost myself in all of that.
I'm sure there would be other people that couldn't handle it, but I certainly couldn't handle it, and I was used to controlling everything in my life.
I controlled every outcome in my life."
In his denial, Armstrong described a hypothetical situation focused on someone else, removing himself from the situation entirely.
In his admission, he owns his statements, delving into his personal emotions and motivations.
But the use of personal pronouns is just one indicator of deception.
Let's look at another example from former Senator and U.S. Presidential candidate John Edwards: "I only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby.
I also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested, agreed to, or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby."
Not only is that a pretty long-winded way to say, "The baby isn't mine," but Edwards never calls the other parties by name, instead saying "that baby," "the woman," and "the apparent father."
Now let's see what he had to say when later admitting paternity: "I am Quinn's father.
I will do everything in my power to provide her with the love and support she deserves."
The statement is short and direct, calling the child by name and addressing his role in her life.
So how can you apply these lie-spotting techniques to your life?
First, remember that many of the lies we encounter on a daily basis are far less serious that these examples, and may even be harmless.
But it's still worthwhile to be aware of telltale clues, like minimal self-references, negative language, simple explanations and convoluted phrasing.
It just might help you avoid an overvalued stock, an ineffective product, or even a terrible relationship.
I'm a marine biologist and an explorer-photographer with National Geographic, but I want to share a secret.
This image is totally incorrect, totally incorrect.
I see a couple of people crying in the back that I've blown their idea of mermaids.
All right, the mermaid is indeed real, but anyone who's gone on a dive will know that the ocean looks more like this.
It's because the ocean is this massive filter, and as soon as you start going underwater, you're going to lose your colors, and it's going to get dark and blue very quickly.
But we're humans -- we're terrestrial mammals.
And we've got trichromatic vision, so we see in red, green and blue, and we're just complete color addicts.
We love eye-popping color, and we try to bring this eye-popping color underwater with us.
So there's been a long and sordid history of bringing color underwater, and it starts 88 years ago with Bill Longley and Charles Martin, who were trying to take the first underwater color photograph.
And they're in there with old-school scuba suits, where you're pumping air down to them, and they've got a pontoon of high-explosive magnesium powder, and the poor people at the surface are not sure when they're going to pull the string when they've got their frame in focus, and -- boom! -- a pound of high explosives would go off so they could put a little bit of light underwater and get an image like this beautiful hogfish.
I mean, it's a gorgeous image, but this is not real.
They're creating an artificial environment so we can satisfy our own addiction to color.
And looking at it the other way, what we've been finding is that instead of bringing color underwater with us, that we've been looking at the blue ocean, and it's a crucible of blue, and these animals living there for millions of years have been evolving all sorts of ways to take in that blue light and give off other colors.
And here's just a little sample of what this secret world looks like.
It's like an underwater light show.
(Music) Again, what we're seeing here is blue light hitting this image.
These animals are absorbing the blue light and immediately transforming this light.
So if you think about it, the ocean is 71 percent of the planet, and blue light can extend down to almost a 1,000 meters.
As we go down underwater, after about 10 meters, all the red is gone.
So if you see anything under 10 meters that's red, it's an animal transforming and creating its own red.
This is the largest single monochromatic blue environment on our planet.
And my gateway into this world of biofluorescence begins with corals.
And I want to give a full TED Talk on corals and just how cool these things are.
One of the things that they do, one of their miraculous feats, is they produce lots of these fluorescent proteins, fluorescent molecules.
And in this coral, it could be making up to 14 percent of its body mass -- could be this fluorescent protein.
So you wouldn't be making, like, 14 percent muscle and not using it, so it's likely doing something that has a functional role.
And for the last 10, 15 years, this was so special to me, because this molecule has turned out to be one of the most revolutionary tools in biomedical science, and it's allowing us to better see inside ourselves.
So, how do I study this?
In order to study biofluorescence, we swim at night.
And when I started out, I was just using these blue duct-tape filters over my strobe, so I could make sure I'm actually seeing the light that's being transformed by the animals.
We're making an exhibit for the Museum of Natural History, and we're trying to show off how great the fluorescent corals are on the reef, and something happened that just blew me away: this.
In the middle of our corals, is this green fluorescent fish.
It's the first time we've ever seen a green fluorescent fish or any vertebrate for that matter.
And we're rubbing our eyes, checking the filters, thinking that somebody's maybe playing a joke on us with the camera, but the eel was real.
It was the first green fluorescent eel that we found, and this just changed my trajectory completely.
So I had to put down my corals and team up with a fish scientist, John Sparks, and begin a search around the world to see how prevalent this phenomenon is.
And fish are much more interesting than corals, because they have really advanced vision, and some of the fish even have, the way that I was photographing it, they have lenses in their eyes that would magnify the fluorescence.
So I wanted to seek this out further.
So we designed a new set of gear and we're scouring the reefs around the world, looking for fluorescent life.
And it's a bit like "E.T. phone home."
We're out there swimming with this blue light, and we're looking for a response, for animals to be absorbing the light and transferring this back to us.
And eventually, we found our photobombing Kaupichphys eel.
It's a really shy, reclusive eel that we know almost nothing about.
They're only about the size of my finger, and they spend about 99.9 percent of their time hidden under a rock.
But these eels do come out to mate under full-moon nights, and that full-moon night translates underwater to blue.
Perhaps they're using this as a way to see each other, quickly find each other, mate, go back into their hole for the next long stint of time.
But then we started to find other fluorescent marine life, like this green fluorescent bream, with its, like, racing stripes along its head and its nape, and it's almost camouflaged and fluorescing at the same intensity as the fluorescent coral there.
After this fish, we were introduced to this red fluorescent scorpionfish cloaked and hidden on this rock.
The only time we've ever seen this, it's either on red fluorescent algae or red fluorescent coral.
Later, we found this stealthy green fluorescent lizardfish.
These lizardfish come in many varieties, and they look almost exactly alike under white light.
But if you look at them under fluorescent light, you see lots of patterns, you can really see the differences among them.
And in total -- we just reported this last year -- we found over 200 species of biofluorescent fish.
One of my inspirations is French artist and biologist Jean Painlevé.
He really captures this entrepreneuring, creative spirit in biology.
He would design his own gear, make his own cameras, and he was fascinated with the seahorse, Hippocampus erectus, and he filmed for the first time the seahorse giving birth.
So this is the male seahorse.
They were one of the first fish to start swimming upright with their brain above their head.
The males give birth, just phenomenal creatures.
So he stayed awake for days.
He even put this electrical visor on his head that would shock him, so he could capture this moment.
Now, I wish I could have shown Painlevé the moment where we found biofluorescent seahorses in the exact same species that he was studying.
And here's our footage.
(Music) They're the most cryptic fish.
You could be swimming right on top of them and not see the seahorse.
They would blend right into the algae, which would also fluoresce red, but they've got great vision, and they go through this long mating ritual, and perhaps they're using it in that effect.
But things got pretty edgy when we found green fluorescence in the stingray, because stingrays are in the Elasmobranch class, which includes ...
sharks.
So I'm, like, a coral biologist.
Somebody's got to go down and check to see if the sharks are fluorescent.
And there I am.
(Laughter) And I was like, "Maybe I should go back to corals."
(Laughter) It turns out that these sharks are not fluorescent.
And then we found it.
In a deep, dark canyon off the coast of California, we found the first biofluorescent swellshark, right underneath all the surfers.
Here it is.
They're just about a meter long. It's called a swellshark.
And they call them a swellshark because if they're threatened, they can gulp down water and blow up like an inner tube, about twice their size, and wedge themselves under a rock, so they don't get eaten by a predator.
And here is our first footage of these biofluorescent swellsharks.
Just magnificent -- I mean, they're showing these distinct patterns, and there are areas that are fluorescent and areas that are not fluorescent, but they've also got these twinkling spots on them that are much brighter than other parts of the shark.
But this is all beautiful to see.
I was like, this is gorgeous.
But what does it mean to the shark?
Can they see this?
And we looked in the literature, and nothing was known about this shark's vision.
So I took this shark to eye specialist Ellis Loew at Cornell University, and we found out that this shark sees discretely and acutely in the blue-green interface, probably about 100 times better than we can see in the dark, but they only see blue-green.
So what it's doing is taking this blue world and it's absorbing the blue, creating green.
It's creating contrast that they can indeed see.
So we have a model, showing that it creates an ability for them to see all these patterns.
And males and females also have, we're finding, distinct patterns among them.
But our last find came really just a few miles from where we are now, in the Solomon Islands.
Swimming at night, I encountered the first biofluorescent sea turtle.
So now it's going from fish and sharks into reptiles, which, again, this is only one month old, but it shows us that we know almost nothing about this hawksbill turtle's vision.
And it makes me think about how much more there is to learn.
And here in the Solomon Islands, there's only a few thousand breeding females of this species left, and this is one of the hotspots for them.
So it shows us how much we need to really protect these animals while they're still here, and understand them.
In thinking about biofluorescence, I wanted to know, how deep does it go?
Does this go all the way to the bottom of the ocean?
So we started using submarines, and we equipped them with special blue lights on the front here.
And we dropped down, and we noticed one important thing -- that as we get down to 1,000 meters, it drops off.
There's no biofluorescent marine life down there, below 1,000 meters -- almost nothing, it's just darkness.
So it's mainly a shallow phenomenon.
And below 1,000 meters, we encountered the bioluminescent zone, where nine out of 10 animals are actually making their own lights and flashing and blinking.
As I try to get deeper, this is slapping on a one-person submarine suit -- some people call this my "Jacques Cousteau meets Woody Allen" moment.
(Laughter) But as we explore down here, I was thinking about: How do we interact with life delicately?
Because we're entering a new age of exploration, where we have to take great care, and we have to set examples how we explore.
So I've teamed up with roboticist Rob Wood at Harvard University, and we've been designing squishy underwater robot fingers, so we can delicately interact with the marine life down there.
The idea is that most of our technologies to explore the deep ocean come from oil and gas and military, who, you know, they're not really caring to be gentle.
Some corals could be 1,000 years old.
You don't want to just go and crush them with a big claw.
So my dream is something like this.
At night, I'm in a submarine, I have force-feedback gloves, and I could delicately set up a lab in the front of my submarine, where the squishy robot fingers are delicately collecting and putting things in jars, and we can conduct our research.
Back to the powerful applied applications.
Here, you're looking at a living brain that's using the DNA of fluorescent marine creatures, this one from jellyfish and corals, to illuminate the living brain and see its connections.
It's funny that we're using RGB just to kind of satisfy our own human intuition, so we can see our brains better.
And even more mind-blowing, is my close colleague Vincent Pieribone at Yale, who has actually designed and engineered a fluorescent protein that responds to voltage.
So he could see when a single neuron fires.
You're essentially looking at a portal into consciousness that was designed by marine creatures.
So this brings me all back to perspective and relationship.
From deep space, our universe looks like a human brain cell, and then here we are in the deep ocean, and we're finding marine creatures and cells that can illuminate the human mind.
And it's my hope that with illuminated minds, we could ponder the overarching interconnectedness of all life, and fathom how much more lies in store if we keep our oceans healthy.
Thank you.
(Applause)
The largest organ in your body isn't your liver or your brain.
It's your skin, with a surface area of about 20 square feet in adults.
Though different areas of the skin have different characteristics, much of this surface performs similar functions, such as sweating, feeling heat and cold, and growing hair.
But after a deep cut or wound, the newly healed skin will look different from the surrounding area, and may not fully regain all its abilities for a while, or at all.
To understand why this happens, we need to look at the structure of the human skin.
The top layer, called the epidermis, consists mostly of hardened cells, called keratinocytes, and provides protection.
Since its outer layer is constantly being shed and renewed, it's pretty easy to repair.
But sometimes a wound penetrates into the dermis, which contains blood vessels and the various glands and nerve endings that enable the skin's many functions.
And when that happens, it triggers the four overlapping stages of the regenerative process.
The first stage, hemostasis, is the skin's response to two immediate threats: that you're now losing blood and that the physical barrier of the epidermis has been compromised.
As the blood vessels tighten to minimize the bleeding, in a process known as vasoconstriction, both threats are averted by forming a blood clot.
A special protein known as fibrin forms cross-links on the top of the skin, preventing blood from flowing out and bacteria or pathogens from getting in.
After about three hours of this, the skin begins to turn red, signaling the next stage, inflammation.
With bleeding under control and the barrier secured, the body sends special cells to fight any pathogens that may have gotten through.
Among the most important of these are white blood cells, known as macrophages, which devour bacteria and damage tissue through a process known as phagocytosis, in addition to producing growth factors to spur healing.
And because these tiny soldiers need to travel through the blood to get to the wound site, the previously constricted blood vessels now expand in a process called vasodilation.
About two to three days after the wound, the proliferative stage occurs, when fibroblast cells begin to enter the wound.
In the process of collagen deposition, they produce a fibrous protein called collagen in the wound site, forming connective skin tissue to replace the fibrin from before.
As epidermal cells divide to reform the outer layer of skin, the dermis contracts to close the wound.
Finally, in the fourth stage of remodeling, the wound matures as the newly deposited collagen is rearranged and converted into specific types.
Through this process, which can take over a year, the tensile strength of the new skin is improved, and blood vessels and other connections are strengthened.
With time, the new tissue can reach from 50-80% of some of its original healthy function, depending on the severity of the initial wound and on the function itself.
But because the skin does not fully recover, scarring continues to be a major clinical issue for doctors around the world.
And even though researchers have made significant strides in understanding the healing process, many fundamental mysteries remain unresolved.
For instance, do fibroblast cells arrive from the blood vessels or from skin tissue adjacent to the wound?
And why do some other mammals, such as deer, heal their wounds much more efficiently and completely than humans?
By finding the answers to these questions and others, we may one day be able to heal ourselves so well that scars will be just a memory.
Have you ever noticed something swimming in your field of vision?
It may look like a tiny worm or a transparent blob, and whenever you try to get a closer look, it disappears, only to reappear as soon as you shift your glance.
But don't go rinsing out your eyes!
What you are seeing is a common phenomenon known as a floater.
The scientific name for these objects is Muscae volitantes, Latin for "flying flies," and true to their name, they can be somewhat annoying.
But they're not actually bugs or any kind of external objects at all.
Rather, they exist inside your eyeball.
Floaters may seem to be alive, since they move and change shape, but they are not alive.
Floaters are tiny objects that cast shadows on the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of your eye.
They might be bits of tissue, red blood cells, or clumps of protein.
And because they're suspended within the vitreous humor, the gel-like liquid that fills the inside of your eye, floaters drift along with your eye movements, and seem to bounce a little when your eye stops.
Floaters may be only barely distinguishable most of the time.
They become more visible the closer they are to the retina, just as holding your hand closer to a table with an overhead light will result in a more sharply defined shadow.
And floaters are particularly noticeable when you are looking at a uniform bright surface, like a blank computer screen, snow, or a clear sky, where the consistency of the background makes them easier to distinguish.
The brighter the light is, the more your pupil contracts.
This has an effect similar to replacing a large diffuse light fixture with a single overhead light bulb, which also makes the shadow appear clearer.
There is another visual phenomenon that looks similar to floaters but is in fact unrelated.
If you've seen tiny dots of light darting about when looking at a bright blue sky, you've experienced what is known as the blue field entoptic phenomenon.
In some ways, this is the opposite of seeing floaters.
Here, you are not seeing shadows but little moving windows letting light through to your retina.
The windows are actually caused by white blood cells moving through the capillaries along your retina's surface.
These leukocytes can be so large that they nearly fill a capillary causing a plasma space to open up in front of them.
Because the space and the white blood cells are both more transparent to blue light than the red blood cells normally present in capillaries, we see a moving dot of light wherever this happens, following the paths of your capillaries and moving in time with your pulse.
Under ideal viewing conditions, you might even see what looks like a dark tail following the dot.
This is the red blood cells that have bunched up behind the leukocyte.
Some science museums have an exhibit which consists of a screen of blue light, allowing you to see these blue sky sprites much more clearly than you normally would.
While everybody's eyes experience these sort of effects, the number and type vary greatly.
In the case of floaters, they often go unnoticed, as our brain learns to ignore them.
However, abnormally numerous or large floaters that interfere with vision may be a sign of a more serious condition, requiring immediate medical treatment.
But the majority of the time entoptic phenomena, such as floaters and blue sky sprites, are just a gentle reminder that what we think we see depends just as much on our biology and minds as it does on the external world.
Imagine you're in Rome, and you've made your way to the Vatican Museums.
And you've been shuffling down long corridors, past statues, frescoes, lots and lots of stuff.
You're heading towards the Sistine Chapel.
At last -- a long corridor, a stair and a door.
You're at the threshold of the Sistine Chapel.
So what are you expecting?
Soaring domes? Choirs of angels?
We don't really have any of that there.
Instead, you may ask yourself, what do we have?
Well, curtains up on the Sistine Chapel.
And I mean literally, you're surrounded by painted curtains, the original decoration of this chapel.
Churches used tapestries not just to keep out cold during long masses, but as a way to represent the great theater of life.
The human drama in which each one of us plays a part is a great story, a story that encompasses the whole world and that came to unfold in the three stages of the painting in the Sistine Chapel.
Now, this building started out as a space for a small group of wealthy, educated Christian priests.
They prayed there. They elected their pope there.
Five hundred years ago, it was the ultimate ecclesiastical man cave.
So, you may ask, how can it be that today it attracts and delights five million people a year, from all different backgrounds?
Because in that compressed space, there was a creative explosion, ignited by the electric excitement of new geopolitical frontiers, which set on fire the ancient missionary tradition of the Church and produced one of the greatest works of art in history.
Now, this development took place as a great evolution, moving from the beginning of a few elite, and eventually able to speak to audiences of people that come from all over the world.
This evolution took place in three stages, each one linked to a historical circumstance.
The first one was rather limited in scope.
It reflected the rather parochial perspective.
The second one took place after worldviews were dramatically altered after Columbus's historical voyage; and the third, when the Age of Discovery was well under way and the Church rose to the challenge of going global.
The original decoration of this church reflected a smaller world.
There were busy scenes that told the stories of the lives of Jesus and Moses, reflecting the development of the Jewish and Christian people.
The man who commissioned this, Pope Sixtus IV, assembled a dream team of Florentine art, including men like Sandro Botticelli and the man who would become Michelangelo's future painting teacher, Ghirlandaio.
These men, they blanketed the walls with a frieze of pure color, and in these stories you'll notice familiar landscapes, the artists using Roman monuments or a Tuscan landscape to render a faraway story, something much more familiar.
With the addition of images of the Pope's friends and family, this was a perfect decoration for a small court limited to the European continent.
But in 1492, the New World was discovered, horizons were expanding, and this little 133 by 46-foot microcosm had to expand as well.
And it did, thanks to a creative genius, a visionary and an awesome story.
Now, the creative genius was Michelangelo Buonarroti, 33 years old when he was tapped to decorate 12,000 square feet of ceiling, and the deck was stacked against him -- he had trained in painting but had left to pursue sculpture.
There were angry patrons in Florence because he had left a stack of incomplete commissions, lured to Rome by the prospect of a great sculptural project, and that project had fallen through.
And he had been left with a commission to paint 12 apostles against a decorative background in the Sistine Chapel ceiling, which would look like every other ceiling in Italy.
But genius rose to the challenge.
In an age when a man dared to sail across the Atlantic Ocean, Michelangelo dared to chart new artistic waters.
He, too, would tell a story -- no Apostles -- but a story of great beginnings, the story of Genesis.
Not really an easy sell, stories on a ceiling.
How would you be able to read a busy scene from 62 feet below?
The painting technique that had been handed on for 200 years in Florentine studios was not equipped for this kind of a narrative.
But Michelangelo wasn't really a painter, and so he played to his strengths.
Instead of being accustomed to filling space with busyness, he took a hammer and chisel and hacked away at a piece of marble to reveal the figure within.
Michelangelo was an essentialist; he would tell his story in massive, dynamic bodies.
This plan was embraced by the larger-than-life Pope Julius II, a man who was unafraid of Michelangelo's brazen genius.
He was nephew to Pope Sixtus IV, and he had been steeped in art for 30 years and he knew its power.
And history has handed down the moniker of the Warrior Pope, but this man's legacy to the Vatican -- it wasn't fortresses and artillery, it was art.
He left us the Raphael Rooms, the Sistine Chapel.
He left St. Peter's Basilica as well as an extraordinary collection of Greco-Roman sculptures -- decidedly un-Christian works that would become the seedbed of the world's first modern museum, the Vatican Museums.
Julius was a man who envisioned a Vatican that would be eternally relevant through grandeur and through beauty, and he was right.
The encounter between these two giants, Michelangelo and Julius II, that's what gave us the Sistine Chapel.
Michelangelo was so committed to this project, that he succeeded in getting the job done in three and a half years, using a skeleton crew and spending most of the time, hours on end, reaching up above his head to paint the stories on the ceiling.
So let's look at this ceiling and see storytelling gone global.
No more familiar artistic references to the world around you.
There's just space and structure and energy; a monumental painted framework which opens onto nine panels, more driven by sculptural form than painterly color.
And we stand in the far end by the entrance, far from the altar and from the gated enclosure intended for the clergy and we peer into the distance, looking for a beginning.
And whether in scientific inquiry or in biblical tradition, we think in terms of a primal spark.
Michelangelo gave us an initial energy when he gave us the separation of light and dark, a churning figure blurry in the distance, compressed into a tight space.
The next figure looms larger, and you see a figure hurtling from one side to the next.
He leaves in his wake the sun, the moon, vegetation.
Michelangelo didn't focus on the stuff that was being created, unlike all the other artists.
He focused on the act of creation.
And then the movement stops, like a caesura in poetry and the creator hovers.
So what's he doing?
Is he creating land? Is he creating sea?
Or is he looking back over his handiwork, the universe and his treasures, just like Michelangelo must have, looking back over his work in the ceiling and proclaiming, "It is good."
So now the scene is set, and you get to the culmination of creation, which is man.
Adam leaps to the eye, a light figure against a dark background.
But looking closer, that leg is pretty languid on the ground, the arm is heavy on the knee.
Adam lacks that interior spark that will impel him to greatness.
That spark is about to be conferred by the creator in that finger, which is one millimeter from the hand of Adam.
It puts us at the edge of our seats, because we're one moment from that contact, through which that man will discover his purpose, leap up and take his place at the pinnacle of creation.
And then Michelangelo threw a curveball.
Who is in that other arm?
Eve, first woman.
No, she's not an afterthought. She's part of the plan.
She's always been in his mind.
Look at her, so intimate with God that her hand curls around his arm.
And for me, an American art historian from the 21st century, this was the moment that the painting spoke to me.
Because I realized that this representation of the human drama was always about men and women -- so much so, that the dead center, the heart of the ceiling, is the creation of woman, not Adam.
And the fact is, that when you see them together in the Garden of Eden, they fall together and together their proud posture turns into folded shame.
You are at critical juncture now in the ceiling.
You are exactly at the point where you and I can go no further into the church.
The gated enclosure keeps us out of the inner sanctum, and we are cast out much like Adam and Eve.
The remaining scenes in the ceiling, they mirror the crowded chaos of the world around us.
You have Noah and his Ark and the flood.
You have Noah. He's making a sacrifice and a covenant with God.
Maybe he's the savior.
Oh, but no, Noah is the one who grew grapes, invented wine, got drunk and passed out naked in his barn.
It is a curious way to design the ceiling, now starting out with God creating life, ending up with some guy blind drunk in a barn.
And so, compared with Adam, you might think Michelangelo is making fun of us.
But he's about to dispel the gloom by using those bright colors right underneath Noah: emerald, topaz, scarlet on the prophet Zechariah.
Zechariah foresees a light coming from the east, and we are turned at this juncture to a new destination, with sibyls and prophets who will lead us on a parade.
You have the heroes and heroines who make safe the way, and we follow the mothers and fathers.
They are the motors of this great human engine, driving it forward.
And now we're at the keystone of the ceiling, the culmination of the whole thing, with a figure that looks like he's about to fall out of his space into our space, encroaching our space.
This is the most important juncture.
Past meets present.
This figure, Jonah, who spent three days in the belly of the whale, for the Christians, is the symbol of the renewal of humanity through Jesus' sacrifice, but for the multitudes of visitors to that museum from all faiths who visit there every day, he is the moment the distant past encounters and meets immediate reality.
All of this brings us to the yawning archway of the altar wall, where we see Michelangelo's Last Judgment, painted in 1534 after the world had changed again.
The Reformation had splintered the Church, the Ottoman Empire had made Islam a household word and Magellan had found a route into the Pacific Ocean.
How is a 59-year-old artist who has never been any further than Venice going to speak to this new world?
Michelangelo chose to paint destiny, that universal desire, common to all of us, to leave a legacy of excellence.
Told in terms of the Christian vision of the Last Judgment, the end of the world, Michelangelo gave you a series of figures who are wearing these strikingly beautiful bodies.
They have no more covers, no more portraits except for a couple.
It's a composition only out of bodies, 391, no two alike, unique like each and every one of us.
They start in the lower corner, breaking away from the ground, struggling and trying to rise.
Those who have risen reach back to help others, and in one amazing vignette, you have a black man and a white man pulled up together in an incredible vision of human unity in this new world.
The lion's share of the space goes to the winner's circle.
There you find men and women completely nude like athletes.
They are the ones who have overcome adversity, and Michelangelo's vision of people who combat adversity, overcome obstacles -- they're just like athletes.
So you have men and women flexing and posing in this extraordinary spotlight.
Presiding over this assembly is Jesus, first a suffering man on the cross, now a glorious ruler in Heaven.
And as Michelangelo proved in his painting, hardship, setbacks and obstacles, they don't limit excellence, they forge it.
Now, this does lead us to one odd thing.
This is the Pope's private chapel, and the best way you can describe that is indeed a stew of nudes.
But Michelangelo was trying to use only the best artistic language, the most universal artistic language he could think of: that of the human body.
And so instead of the way of showing virtue such as fortitude or self-mastery, he borrowed from Julius II's wonderful collection of sculptures in order to show inner strength as external power.
Now, one contemporary did write that the chapel was too beautiful to not cause controversy.
And so it did.
Michelangelo soon found that thanks to the printing press, complaints about the nudity spread all over the place, and soon his masterpiece of human drama was labeled pornography, at which point he added two more portraits, one of the man who criticized him, a papal courtier, and the other one of himself as a dried up husk, no athlete, in the hands of a long-suffering martyr.
The year he died he saw several of these figures covered over, a triumph for trivial distractions over his great exhortation to glory.
And so now we stand in the here and now.
We are caught in that space between beginnings and endings, in the great, huge totality of the human experience.
The Sistine Chapel forces us to look around as if it were a mirror.
Who am I in this picture?
Am I one of the crowd?
Am I the drunk guy?
Am I the athlete?
And as we leave this haven of uplifting beauty, we are inspired to ask ourselves life's biggest questions: Who am I, and what role do I play in this great theater of life?
Thank you.
(Applause) Bruno Giussani: Elizabeth Lev, thank you.
Elizabeth, you mentioned this whole issue of pornography, too many nudes and too many daily life scenes and improper things in the eyes of the time.
But actually the story is bigger.
It's not just touching up and covering up some of the figures.
This work of art was almost destroyed because of that.
Elizabeth Lev: The effect of the Last Judgment was enormous.
The printing press made sure that everybody saw it.
And so, this wasn't something that happened within a couple of weeks.
It was something that happened over the space of 20 years of editorials and complaints, saying to the Church, "You can't possibly tell us how to live our lives.
Did you notice you have pornography in the Pope's chapel?"
And so after complaints and insistence of trying to get this work destroyed, it was finally the year that Michelangelo died that the Church finally found a compromise, a way to save the painting, and that was in putting up these extra 30 covers, and that happens to be the origin of fig-leafing.
That's where it all came about, and it came about from a church that was trying to save a work of art, not indeed deface or destroyed it.
BG: This, what you just gave us, is not the classic tour that people get today when they go to the Sistine Chapel.
(Laughter) EL: I don't know, is that an ad?
(Laughter) BG: No, no, no, not necessarily, it is a statement.
The experience of art today is encountering problems.
Too many people want to see this there, and the result is five million people going through that tiny door and experiencing it in a completely different way than we just did.
EL: Right. I agree. I think it's really nice to be able to pause and look.
But also realize, even when you're in those days, with 28,000 people a day, even those days when you're in there with all those other people, look around you and think how amazing it is that some painted plaster from 500 years ago can still draw all those people standing side by side with you, looking upwards with their jaws dropped.
It's a great statement about how beauty truly can speak to us all through time and through geographic space.
BG: Liz, grazie.
EL: Grazie a te.
BG: Thank you.
(Applause)
For as far back as we can trace our existence, humans have been fascinated with death and resurrection.
Nearly every religion in the world has some interpretation of them, and from our earliest myths to the latest cinematic blockbusters, the dead keep coming back.
But is resurrection really possible?
And what is the actual difference between a living creature and a dead body, anyway?
To understand what death is, we need to understand what life is.
One ancient theory was an idea called vitalism, which claimed that living things were unique because they were filled with a special substance, or energy, that was the essence of life.
Whether it was called qi, lifeblood, or humors, the belief in such an essence was common throughout the world, and still persists in the stories of creatures who can somehow drain life from others, or some form of magical sources that can replenish it.
Vitalism began to fade in the Western world following the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century.
René Descartes advanced the notion that the human body was essentially no different from any other machine, brought to life by a divinely created soul located in the brain's pineal gland.
And in 1907, Dr. Duncan McDougall even claimed that the soul had mass, weighing patients immediately before and after death in an attempt to prove it.
Though his experiments were discredited, much like the rest of vitalism, traces of his theory still come up in popular culture.
But where do all these discredited theories leave us?
What we now know is that life is not contained in some magical substance or spark, but within the ongoing biological processes themselves.
And to understand these processes, we need to zoom down to the level of our individual cells.
Inside each of these cells, chemical reactions are constantly occurring, powered by the glucose and oxygen that our bodies convert into the energy-carrying molecule known as ATP.
Cells use this energy for everything from repair to growth to reproduction.
Not only does it take a lot of energy to make the necessary molecules, but it takes even more to get them where they need to be.
The universal phenomenon of entropy means that molecules will tend towards diffusing randomly, moving from areas of high concentration to low concentration, or even breaking apart into smaller molecules and atoms.
So cells must constantly keep entropy in check by using energy to maintain their molecules in the very complicated formations necessary for biological functions to occur.
The breaking down of these arrangements when the entire cell succumbs to entropy is what eventually results in death.
This is the reason organisms can't be simply sparked back to life once they've already died.
We can pump air into someone's lungs, but it won't do much good if the many other processes involved in the respiratory cycle are no longer functioning.
Similarly, the electric shock from a defibrillator doesn't jump-start an inanimate heart, but resynchronizes the muscle cells in an abnormally beating heart so they regain their normal rhythm.
This can prevent a person from dying, but it won't raise a dead body, or a monster sewn together from dead bodies.
So it would seem that all our various medical miracles can delay or prevent death but not reverse it.
But that's not as simple as it sounds because constant advancements in technology and medicine have resulted in diagnoses such as coma, describing potentially reversible conditions, under which people would have previously been considered dead.
In the future, the point of no return may be pushed even further.
Some animals are known to extend their lifespans or survive extreme conditions by slowing down their biological processes to the point where they are virtually paused.
And research into cryonics hopes to achieve the same by freezing dying people and reviving them later when newer technology is able to help them.
See, if the cells are frozen, there's very little molecular movement, and diffusion practically stops.
Even if all of a person's cellular processes had already broken down, this could still conceivably be reversed by a swarm of nanobots, moving all the molecules back to their proper positions, and injecting all of the cells with ATP at the same time, presumably causing the body to simply pick up where it left off.
So if we think of life not as some magical spark, but a state of incredibly complex, self-perpetuating organization, death is just the process of increasing entropy that destroys this fragile balance.
And the point at which someone is completely dead turns out not to be a fixed constant, but simply a matter of how much of this entropy we're currently capable of reversing.
Slavery, the treatment of human beings as property, deprived of personal rights, has occurred in many forms throughout the world.
But one institution stands out for both its global scale and its lasting legacy.
The Atlantic slave trade, occurring from the late 15th to the mid 19th century and spanning three continents, forcibly brought more than 10 million Africans to the Americas.
The impact it would leave affected not only these slaves and their descendants, but the economies and histories of large parts of the world.
There had been centuries of contact between Europe and Africa via the Mediterranean.
But the Atlantic slave trade began in the late 1400s with Portuguese colonies in West Africa, and Spanish settlement of the Americas shortly after.
The crops grown in the new colonies, sugar cane, tobacco, and cotton, were labor intensive, and there were not enough settlers or indentured servants to cultivate all the new land.
American Natives were enslaved, but many died from new diseases, while others effectively resisted.
And so to meet the massive demand for labor, the Europeans looked to Africa.
African slavery had existed for centuries in various forms.
Some slaves were indentured servants, with a limited term and the chance to buy one's freedom.
Others were more like European serfs.
In some societies, slaves could be part of a master's family, own land, and even rise to positions of power.
But when white captains came offering manufactured goods, weapons, and rum for slaves, African kings and merchants had little reason to hesitate.
They viewed the people they sold not as fellow Africans but criminals, debtors, or prisoners of war from rival tribes.
By selling them, kings enriched their own realms, and strengthened them against neighboring enemies.
African kingdoms prospered from the slave trade, but meeting the European's massive demand created intense competition.
Slavery replaced other criminal sentences, and capturing slaves became a motivation for war, rather than its result.
To defend themselves from slave raids, neighboring kingdoms needed European firearms, which they also bought with slaves.
The slave trade had become an arms race, altering societies and economies across the continent.
As for the slaves themselves, they faced unimaginable brutality.
After being marched to slave forts on the coast, shaved to prevent lice, and branded, they were loaded onto ships bound for the Americas.
About 20% of them would never see land again.
Most captains of the day were tight packers, cramming as many men as possible below deck.
While the lack of sanitation caused many to die of disease, and others were thrown overboard for being sick, or as discipline, the captain's ensured their profits by cutting off slave's ears as proof of purchase.
Some captives took matters into their own hands.
Many inland Africans had never seen whites before, and thought them to be cannibals, constantly taking people away and returning for more.
Afraid of being eaten, or just to avoid further suffering, they committed suicide or starved themselves, believing that in death, their souls would return home.
Those who survived were completley dehumanized, treated as mere cargo.
Women and children were kept above deck and abused by the crew, while the men were made to perform dances in order to keep them exercised and curb rebellion.
What happened to those Africans who reached the New World and how the legacy of slavery still affects their descendants today is fairly well known.
But what is not often discussed is the effect that the Atlantic slave trade had on Africa's future.
Not only did the continent lose tens of millions of its able-bodied population, but because most of the slaves taken were men, the long-term demographic effect was even greater.
When the slave trade was finally outlawed in the Americas and Europe, the African kingdoms whose economies it had come to dominate collapsed, leaving them open to conquest and colonization.
And the increased competition and influx of European weapons fueled warfare and instability that continues to this day.
The Atlantic slave trade also contributed to the development of racist ideology.
Most African slavery had no deeper reason than legal punishment or intertribal warfare, but the Europeans who preached a universal religion, and who had long ago outlawed enslaving fellow Christians, needed justification for a practice so obviously at odds with their ideals of equality.
So they claimed that Africans were biologically inferior and destined to be slaves, making great efforts to justify this theory.
Thus, slavery in Europe and the Americas acquired a racial basis, making it impossible for slaves and their future descendants to attain equal status in society.
In all of these ways, the Atlantic slave trade was an injustice on a massive scale whose impact has continued long after its abolition.
The human eye is an amazing mechanism, able to detect anywhere from a few photons to direct sunlight, or switch focus from the screen in front of you to the distant horizon in a third of a second.
In fact, the structures required for such incredible flexibility were once considered so complex that Charles Darwin himself acknowledged that the idea of there having evolved seemed absurd in the highest possible degree.
And yet, that is exactly what happened, starting more than 500 million years ago.
The story of the human eye begins with a simple light spot, such as the one found in single-celled organisms, like euglena.
This is a cluster of light-sensitive proteins linked to the organism's flagellum, activating when it finds light and, therefore, food.
A more complex version of this light spot can be found in the flat worm, planaria.
Being cupped, rather than flat, enables it to better sense the direction of the incoming light.
Among its other uses, this ability allows an organism to seek out shade and hide from predators.
Over the millenia, as such light cups grew deeper in some organisms, the opening at the front grew smaller.
The result was a pinhole effect, which increased resolution dramatically, reducing distortion by only allowing a thin beam of light into the eye.
The nautilus, an ancestor of the octopus, uses this pinhole eye for improved resolution and directional sensing.
Although the pinhole eye allows for simple images, the key step towards the eye as we know it is a lens.
This is thought to have evolved through transparent cells covering the opening to prevent infection, allowing the inside of the eye to fill with fluid that optimizes light sensitivity and processing.
Crystalline proteins forming at the surface created a structure that proved useful in focusing light at a single point on the retina.
It is this lens that is the key to the eye's adaptability, changing its curvature to adapt to near and far vision.
This structure of the pinhole camera with a lens served as the basis for what would eventually evolve into the human eye.
Further refinements would include a colored ring, called the iris, that controls the amount of light entering the eye, a tough white outer layer, known as the sclera, to maintain its structure, and tear glands that secrete a protective film.
But equally important was the accompanying evolution of the brain, with its expansion of the visual cortex to process the sharper and more colorful images it was receiving.
We now know that far from being an ideal masterpiece of design, our eye bares traces of its step by step evolution.
For example, the human retina is inverted, with light-detecting cells facing away from the eye opening.
This results in a blind spot, where the optic nerve must pierce the retina to reach the photosensitive layer in the back.
The similar looking eyes of cephalopods, which evolved independently, have a front-facing retina, allowing them to see without a blind spot.
Other creatures' eyes display different adaptations.
Anableps, the so called four-eyed fish, have eyes divided in two sections for looking above and under water, perfect for spotting both predators and prey.
Cats, classically nighttime hunters, have evolved with a reflective layer maximizing the amount of light the eye can detect, granting them excellent night vision, as well as their signature glow.
These are just a few examples of the huge diversity of eyes in the animal kingdom.
So if you could design an eye, would you do it any differently?
This question isn't as strange as it might sound.
Today, doctors and scientists are looking at different eye structures to help design biomechanical implants for the vision impaired.
And in the not so distant future, the machines built with the precision and flexibilty of the human eye may even enable it to surpass its own evolution.
It was an afternoon in the fall of 2005.
I was working at the ACLU as the organization's science advisor.
I really, really loved my job, but I was having one of those days where I was feeling just a little bit discouraged.
So I wandered down the hallway to my colleague Chris Hansen's office.
Chris had been at the ACLU for more than 30 years, so he had deep institutional knowledge and insights.
I explained to Chris that I was feeling a little bit stuck.
I had been investigating a number of issues at the intersection of science and civil liberties -- super interesting.
But I wanted the ACLU to engage these issues in a much bigger way, in a way that could really make a difference.
So Chris cut right to the chase, and he says, "Well, of all the issues you've been looking at, what are the top five?"
"Well, there's genetic discrimination, and reproductive technologies, and biobanking, and ...
oh, there's this really cool issue, functional MRI and using it for lie detection, and ...
oh, and of course, there's gene patents."
"Gene patents?"
"Yes, you know, patents on human genes."
"No!
You're telling me that the US government has been issuing patents on part of the human body?
That can't be right."
I went back to my office and sent Chris three articles.
And 20 minutes later, he came bursting in my office.
"Oh my god! You're right! Who can we sue?"
(Laughter) Now Chris is a really brilliant lawyer, but he knew almost nothing about patent law and certainly nothing about genetics.
I knew something about genetics, but I wasn't even a lawyer, let alone a patent lawyer.
So clearly we had a lot to learn before we could file a lawsuit.
First, we needed to understand exactly what was patented when someone patented a gene.
Gene patents typically contain dozens of claims, but the most controversial of these are to so-called "isolated DNA" -- namely, a piece of DNA that has been removed from a cell.
Gene patent proponents say, "See? We didn't patent the gene in your body, we patented an isolated gene."
And that's true, but the problem is that any use of the gene requires that it be isolated.
And the patents weren't just to a particular gene that they isolated, but on every possible version of that gene.
So what does that mean?
That means that you can't give your gene to your doctor and ask him or her to look at it, say, to see if it has any mutations, without permission of the patent holder.
It also means that the patent holder has the right to stop anyone from using that gene in research or clinical testing.
Allowing patent holders, often private companies, to lock up stretches of the human genome was harming patients.
Consider Abigail, a 10-year-old with long QT syndrome, a serious heart condition that, if left untreated, can result in sudden death.
The company that obtained a patent on two genes associated with this condition developed a test to diagnose the syndrome.
But then they went bankrupt and they never offered it.
So another lab tried to offer the test, but the company that held the patents threatened to sue the lab for patent infringement.
So as a result, for 2 years, no test was available.
During that time, Abigail died of undiagnosed long QT.
Gene patents clearly were a problem and were harming patients.
But was there a way we could challenge them?
Turns out that the Supreme Court has made clear through a long line of cases, that certain things are not patent eligible.
You can't patent products of nature -- the air, the water, minerals, elements of the periodic table.
And you can't patent laws of nature -- the law of gravity, E = mc2.
These things are just too fundamental and must remain free to all and reserved exclusively to none.
It seemed to us that DNA, the most fundamental structure of life, that codes for the production of all of our proteins, is both a product of nature and a law of nature, regardless of whether it's in our bodies or sitting in the bottom of a test tube.
As we delved into this issue, we traveled all over the country to speak with many different experts -- scientists, medical professionals, lawyers, patent lawyers.
Most of them agreed that we were right as a matter of policy, and, at least in theory, as a matter of law.
All of them thought our chances of winning a gene-patent challenge were about zero.
Why is that?
Well, the patent office had been issuing these patents for more than 20 years.
There were literally thousands of patents on human genes.
The patent bar was deeply entrenched in the status quo, the biotech industry had grown up around this practice, and legislation to ban gene patents had been introduced year after year in Congress, and had gone absolutely nowhere.
So the bottom line: courts just weren't going to be willing to overturn these patents.
Now, neither Chris nor I were the type to shy away from a challenge, and hearing, "Being right just isn't enough," seemed all the more reason to take on this fight.
So we set out to build our case.
Now, patent cases tend to be: Company A sues Company B over some really narrow, obscure technical issue.
We weren't really interested in that kind of case, and we thought this case was much bigger than that.
This was about scientific freedom, medical progress, the rights of patients.
So we decided we were going to develop a case that was not like your typical patent case -- more like a civil rights case.
We set out to identify a gene-patent holder that was vigorously enforcing its patents and then to organize a broad coalition of plaintiffs and experts that could tell the court about all the ways that these patents were harming patients and innovation.
We found the prime candidate to sue in Myriad Genetics, a company that's based in Salt Lake City, Utah.
Myriad held patents on two genes, the BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes.
Women with certain mutations along these genes are considered to be at a significantly increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer.
Myriad had used its patents to maintain a complete monopoly on BRCA testing in the United States.
It had forced multiple labs that were offering BRCA testing to stop.
It charged a lot of money for its test -- over 3,000 dollars.
It had stopped sharing its clinical data with the international scientific community.
And perhaps worst of all, for a period of several years, Myriad refused to update its test to include additional mutations that had been identified by a team of researchers in France.
It has been estimated that during that period, for several years, as many as 12 percent of women undergoing testing received the wrong answer -- a negative test result that should have been positive.
This is Kathleen Maxian.
Kathleen's sister Eileen developed breast cancer at age 40 and she was tested by Myriad.
The test was negative.
The family was relieved.
That meant that Eileen's cancer most likely didn't run in the family, and that other members of her family didn't need to be tested.
But two years later, Kathleen was diagnosed with advanced-stage ovarian cancer.
It turned out that Kathleen's sister was among the 12 percent who received a false-negative test result.
Had Eileen received the proper result, Kathleen would have then been tested, and her ovarian cancer could have been prevented.
Once we settled on Myriad, we then had to form a coalition of plaintiffs and experts that could illuminate these problems.
We ended up with 20 highly committed plaintiffs: genetic counselors, geneticists who had received cease and desist letters, advocacy organizations, four major scientific organizations that collectively represented more than 150,000 scientists and medical professionals, and individual women who either couldn't afford Myriad's test, or who wanted to obtain a second opinion but could not, as a result of the patents.
One of the major challenges we had in preparing the case was figuring out how best to communicate the science.
So in order to argue that what Myriad did was not an invention, and that isolated BRCA genes were products of nature, we had to explain a couple of basic concepts, like: What's a gene? What's DNA?
How is DNA isolated, and why isn't that an invention?
We spent hours and hours with our plaintiffs and experts, trying to come up with ways of explaining these concepts simply yet accurately.
And we ended up relying heavily on the use of metaphors, like gold.
So isolating DNA -- it's like extracting gold from a mountain or taking it out of a stream bed.
You might be able to patent the process for mining the gold, but you can't patent the gold itself.
It might've taken a lot of hard work and effort to dig the gold out of the mountain; you still can't patent it, it's still gold.
And the gold, once it's extracted, can clearly be used for all sorts of things that it couldn't be used for when it was in the mountain; you can make jewelry out of it for example -- still can't patent the gold, it's still gold.
So now it's 2009, and we're ready to file our case.
We filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York, and the case was randomly assigned to Judge Robert Sweet.
In March 2010, Judge Sweet issued his opinion -- 152 pages -- and a complete victory for our side.
In reading the opinion, we could not get over how eloquently he described the science in the case.
I mean, our brief -- it was pretty good, but not this good.
How did he develop such a deep understanding of this issue in such a short time?
We just could not comprehend how this had happened.
So it turned out, Judge Sweet's clerk working for him at the time, was not just a lawyer -- he was a scientist.
He was not just a scientist -- he had a PhD in molecular biology.
(Laughter) What an incredible stroke of luck!
Myriad then appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
And here things got really interesting.
First, in a pivotal moment of this case, the US government switched sides.
So in the district court the government submitted a brief on Myriad's side.
But now in direct opposition to its own patent office, the US government files a brief that states that is has reconsidered this issue in light of the district court's opinion, and has concluded that isolated DNA is not patent eligible.
This was a really big deal, totally unexpected.
The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit hears all patent cases, and it has a reputation for being very, very pro-patent.
So even with this remarkable development, we expected to lose.
And we did.
Sort of.
Ends up split decision, 2 to 1.
But the two judges who ruled against us, did so for completely different reasons.
The first one, Judge Lourie, made up his own novel, biological theory -- totally wrong.
(Laughter) He decided Myriad had created a new chemical -- made absolutely no sense.
Myriad didn't even argue this, so it came out of the blue.
The other, Judge Moore, said she basically agreed with us that isolated DNA is a product of nature.
But she's like, "I don't want to shake up the biotech industry."
The third, Judge Bryson, agreed with us.
So now we sought review by the Supreme Court.
And when you petition the Supreme Court, you have to present a question that you want the Court to answer.
Usually these questions take the form of a super-long paragraph, like a whole page long with lots and lots of clauses, "wherein this" and "therefore that."
We submitted perhaps the shortest question presented ever.
Four words: Are human genes patentable?
Now when Chris first asked me what I thought of these words, I said, "Well, I don't know.
I think you have to say, 'Is isolated DNA patentable?'" "Nope.
I want the justices to have the very same reaction that I had when you brought this issue to me seven years ago."
Well, I certainly couldn't argue with that.
The Supreme Court only hears about one percent of the cases that it receives, and it agreed to hear ours.
The day of the oral argument arrives, and it was really, really exciting -- long line of people outside, people had been standing in line since 2:30 in the morning to try to get into the courthouse.
Two breast cancer organizations, Breast Cancer Action and FORCE, had organized a demonstration on the courthouse steps.
Chris and I sat quietly in the hallway, moments before he was to walk in and argue the most important case of his career.
I was clearly more nervous than he was.
But any remaining panic subsided as I walked into the courtroom and looked around at a sea of friendly faces: our individual women clients who had shared their deeply personal stories, the geneticists who had taken huge chunks of time out of their busy careers to dedicate themselves to this fight and representatives from a diverse array of medical, patient advocacy, environmental and religious organizations, who had submitted friend of the court briefs in the case.
Also in the room were three leaders of the Human Genome Project, including the co-discoverer of DNA himself, James Watson, who had submitted a brief to the court, where he referred to gene patenting as "lunacy."
(Laughter) The diversity of the communities represented in this room and the contributions each had made to make this day a reality spoke volumes to what was at stake.
The argument itself was riveting.
Chris argued brilliantly.
But for me, the most thrilling aspect was watching the Supreme Court justices grapple with isolated DNA, through a series of colorful analogies and feisty exchanges, very much the same way as our legal team had done for the past seven years.
Justice Kagan likened isolating DNA to extracting a medicinal plant from the Amazon.
Justice Roberts distinguished it from carving a baseball bat from a tree.
And in one of my absolutely favorite moments, Justice Sotomayor proclaimed isolated DNA to be "just nature sitting there."
(Laughter) We felt pretty confident leaving the courtroom that day, but I could never have anticipated the outcome: nine to zero.
"A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature, and not patent-eligible merely because it has been isolated.
And furthermore, Myriad did not create anything."
Within 24 hours of the decision, five labs had announced that they would begin to offer testing for the BRCA genes.
Some of them promised to offer the tests at a lower price than Myriad's.
Some promised to provide a more comprehensive test than the one Myriad was offering.
But of course the decision goes far beyond Myriad.
It ends a 25-year practice of allowing patents on human genes in the United States.
It clears a significant barrier to biomedical discovery and innovation.
And it helps to ensure that patients like Abigail, Kathleen and Eileen have access to the tests that they need.
A few weeks after the court issued its decision, I received a small package in the mail.
It was from Bob Cook-Deegan, a professor at Duke University and one the very first people Chris and I went to visit when we started to consider whether to bring this case.
I opened it up to find a small stuffed animal.
(Laughter) We took a big risk in taking this case.
Part of what gave us the courage to take that risk was knowing that we were doing the right thing.
The process took nearly eight years from the start to finish, with many twists and turns along the way.
A little luck certainly helped, but it was the communities that we bridged, the alliances that we created, that made pigs fly.
Thank you.
(Applause)
How does your smartphone know exactly where you are?
The answer lies 12,000 miles over your head in an orbiting satellite that keeps time to the beat of an atomic clock powered by quantum mechanics.
Phew.
Let's break that down.
First of all, why is it so important to know what time it is on a satellite when location is what we're concerned about?
The first thing your phone needs to determine is how far it is from a satellite.
Each satellite constantly broadcasts radio signals that travel from space to your phone at the speed of light.
Your phone records the signal arrival time and uses it to calculate the distance to the satellite using the simple formula, distance = c x time, where c is the speed of light and time is how long the signal traveled.
But there's a problem.
Light is incredibly fast.
If we were only able to calculate time to the nearest second, every location on Earth, and far beyond, would seem to be the same distance from the satellite.
So in order to calculate that distance to within a few dozen feet, we need the best clock ever invented.
Enter atomic clocks, some of which are so precise that they would not gain or lose a second even if they ran for the next 300 million years.
Atomic clocks work because of quantum physics.
All clocks must have a constant frequency.
In other words, a clock must carry out some repetitive action to mark off equivalent increments of time.
Just as a grandfather clock relies on the constant swinging back and forth of a pendulum under gravity, the tick tock of an atomic clock is maintained by the transition between two energy levels of an atom.
This is where quantum physics comes into play.
Quantum mechanics says that atoms carry energy, but they can't take on just any arbitrary amount.
Instead, atomic energy is constrained to a precise set of levels.
We call these quanta.
As a simple analogy, think about driving a car onto a freeway.
As you increase your speed, you would normally continuously go from, say, 20 miles/hour up to 70 miles/hour.
Now, if you had a quantum atomic car, you wouldn't accelerate in a linear fashion.
Instead, you would instantaneously jump, or transition, from one speed to the next.
For an atom, when a transition occurs from one energy level to another, quantum mechanics says that the energy difference is equal to a characteristic frequency, multiplied by a constant, where the change in energy is equal to a number, called Planck's constant, times the frequency.
That characteristic frequency is what we need to make our clock.
GPS satellites rely on cesium and rubidium atoms as frequency standards.
In the case of cesium 133, the characteristic clock frequency is 9,192,631,770 Hz.
That's 9 billion cycles per second.
That's a really fast clock.
No matter how skilled a clockmaker may be, every pendulum, wind-up mechanism and quartz crystal resonates at a slightly different frequency.
However, every cesium 133 atom in the universe oscillates at the same exact frequency.
So thanks to the atomic clock, we get a time reading accurate to within 1 billionth of a second, and a very precise measurement of the distance from that satellite.
Let's ignore the fact that you're almost definitely on Earth.
We now know that you're at a fixed distance from the satellite.
In other words, you're somewhere on the surface of a sphere centered around the satellite.
Measure your distance from a second satellite and you get another overlapping sphere.
Keep doing that, and with just four measurements, and a little correction using Einstein's theory of relativity, you can pinpoint your location to exactly one point in space.
So that's all it takes: a multibillion-dollar network of satellites, oscillating cesium atoms, quantum mechanics, relativity, a smartphone, and you.
No problem.
"Hi, Bob."
"Morning, Kelly. The tulips looks great."
Have you ever wondered how your dog experiences the world?
Here's what she sees.
Not terribly interesting.
But what she smells, that's a totally different story.
And it begins at her wonderfully developed nose.
As your dog catches the first hints of fresh air, her nose's moist, spongy outside helps capture any scents the breeze carries.
The ability to smell separately with each nostril, smelling in stereo, helps to determine the direction of the smell's source so that within the first few moments of sniffing, the dog starts to become aware of not just what kind of things are out there but also where they're located.
As air enters the nose, a small fold of tissue divides it into two separate folds, one for breathing and one just for smelling.
This second airflow enters a region filled with highly specialized olfactory receptor cells, several hundred millions of them, compaired to our five million.
And unlike our clumsy way of breathing in and out through the same passage, dogs exhale through slits at the side of their nose, creating swirls of air that help draw in new odor molecules and allow odor concentration to build up over mulitple sniffs.
But all that impressive nasal architecture wouldn't be much help without something to process the loads of information the nose scoops up.
And it turns out that the olfactory system dedicated to proessing smells takes up many times more relative brain area in dogs than in humans.
All of this allows dogs to distinguish and remember a staggering variety of specific scents at concentrations up to 100 million times less than what our noses can detect.
If you can smell a spritz of perfume in a small room, a dog would have no trouble smelling it in an enclosed stadium and distinguishing its ingredients, to boot.
And everything in the street, every passing person or car, any contents of the neighbor's trash, each type of tree, and all the birds and insects in it has a distinct odor profile telling your dog what it is, where it is, and which direction it's moving in.
Besides being much more powerful than ours, a dog's sense of smell can pick up things that can't even be seen at all.
A whole separate olfactory system, called the vomeronasal organ, above the roof of the mouth, detects the hormones all animals, Including humans, naturally release.
It lets dogs identify potential mates, or distinguish between friendly and hostile animals.
It alerts them to our various emotional states, and it can even tell them when someone is pregnant or sick.
Because olfaction is more primal than other senses, bypassing the thalamus to connect directly to the brain structures involving emotion and instinct, we might even say a dog's perception is more immediate and visceral than ours.
But the most amazing thing about your dog's nose is that it can traverse time.
The past appears in tracks left by passersby, and by the warmth of a recently parked car where the residue of where you've been and what you've done recently.
Landmarks like fire hydrants and trees are aromatic bulletin boards carrying messages of who's been by, what they've been eating, and how they're feeling.
And the future is in the breeze, alerting them to something or someone approaching long before you see them.
Where we see and hear something at a single moment, a dog smells an entire story from start to finish.
In some of the best examples of canine-human collaboration, dogs help us by sharing and reacting to those stories.
They can respond with kindness to people in distress, or with aggression to threats because stress and anger manifest as a cloud of hormones recognizable to the dog's nose.
With the proper training, they can even alert us to invisible threats ranging from bombs to cancer.
As it turns out, humanity's best friend is not one who experiences the same things we do, but one whose incredible nose reveals a whole other world beyond our eyes.
If you know an older left-handed person, chances are they had to learn to write or eat with their right hand.
And in many parts of the world, it's still common practice to force children to use their "proper" hand.
Even the word for right also means correct or good, not just in English, but many other languages, too.
But if being left-handed is so wrong, then why does it happen in the first place?
Today, about 1/10 of the world's population are left-handed.
Archeological evidence shows that it's been that way for as long as 500,000 years, with about 10% of human remains showing the associated differences in arm length and bone density, and some ancient tools and artifacts showing evidence of left-hand use.
And despite what many may think, handedness is not a choice.
It can be predicted even before birth based on the fetus' position in the womb.
So, if handedness is inborn, does that mean it's genetic?
Well, yes and no.
Identical twins, who have the same genes, can have different dominant hands.
In fact, this happens as often as it does with any other sibling pair.
But the chances of being right or left-handed are determined by the handedness of your parents in surprisingly consistent ratios.
If your father was left-handed but your mother was right-handed, you have a 17% chance of being born left-handed, while two righties will have a left-handed child only 10% of the time.
Handedness seems to be determined by a roll of the dice, but the odds are set by your genes.
All of this implies there's a reason that evolution has produced this small proportion of lefties, and maintained it over the course of millennia.
And while there have been several theories attempting to explain why handedness exists in the first place, or why most people are right-handed, a recent mathematical model suggests that the actual ratio reflects a balance between competitive and cooperative pressures on human evolution.
The benefits of being left-handed are clearest in activities involving an opponent, like combat or competitive sports.
For example, about 50% of top hitters in baseball have been left-handed.
Why?
Think of it as a surprise advantage.
Because lefties are a minority to begin with, both right-handed and left-handed competitors will spend most of their time encountering and practicing against righties.
So when the two face each other, the left-hander will be better prepared against this right-handed opponent, while the righty will be thrown off.
This fighting hypothesis, where an imbalance in the population results in an advantage for left-handed fighters or athletes, is an example of negative frequency-dependent selection.
But according to the principles of evolution, groups that have a relative advantage tend to grow until that advantage disappears.
If people were only fighting and competing throughout human evolution, natural selection would lead to more lefties being the ones that made it until there were so many of them, that it was no longer a rare asset.
So in a purely competitive world, 50% of the population would be left-handed.
But human evolution has been shaped by cooperation, as well as competition.
And cooperative pressure pushes handedness distribution in the opposite direction.
In golf, where performance doesn't depend on the opponent, only 4% of top players are left-handed, an example of the wider phenomenon of tool sharing.
Just as young potential golfers can more easily find a set of right-handed clubs, many of the important instruments that have shaped society were designed for the right-handed majority.
Because lefties are worse at using these tools, and suffer from higher accident rates, they would be less successful in a purely cooperative world, eventually disappearing from the population.
So by correctly predicting the distribution of left-handed people in the general population, as well as matching data from various sports, the model indicates that the persistence of lefties as a small but stable minority reflects an equilibrium that comes from competitive and cooperative effects playing out simultaneously over time.
And the most intriguing thing is what the numbers can tell us about various populations.
From the skewed distribution of pawedness in cooperative animals, to the slightly larger percentage of lefties in competitive hunter-gatherer societies, we may even find that the answers to some puzzles of early human evolution are already in our hands.
Code is the next universal language.
In the seventies, it was punk music that drove the whole generation.
In the eighties, it was probably money.
But for my generation of people, software is the interface to our imagination and our world.
And that means that we need a radically, radically more diverse set of people to build those products, to not see computers as mechanical and lonely and boring and magic, to see them as things that they can tinker and turn around and twist, and so forth.
My personal journey into the world of programming and technology started at the tender age of 14.
I had this mad teenage crush on an older man, and the older man in question just happened to be the then Vice President of the United States, Mr. Al Gore.
And I did what every single teenage girl would want to do.
I wanted to somehow express all of this love, so I built him a website, it's over here.
And in 2001, there was no Tumblr, there was no Facebook, there was no Pinterest.
So I needed to learn to code in order to express all of this longing and loving.
And that is how programming started for me.
It started as a means of self-expression.
Just like when I was smaller, I would use crayons and legos.
And when I was older, I would use guitar lessons and theater plays.
But then, there were other things to get excited about, like poetry and knitting socks and conjugating French irregular verbs and coming up with make-believe worlds and Bertrand Russell and his philosophy.
And I started to be one of those people who felt that computers are boring and technical and lonely.
Here's what I think today.
Little girls don't know that they are not supposed to like computers.
Little girls are amazing.
They are really, really good at concentrating on things and being exact and they ask amazing questions like, "What?" and "Why?" and "How?" and "What if?"
And they don't know that they are not supposed to like computers.
It's the parents who do.
It's us parents who feel like computer science is this esoteric, weird science discipline that only belongs to the mystery makers.
That it's almost as far removed from everyday life as, say, nuclear physics.
And they are partly right about that.
There's a lot of syntax and controls and data structures and algorithms and practices, protocols and paradigms in programming.
And we as a community, we've made computers smaller and smaller.
We've built layers and layers of abstraction on top of each other between the man and the machine to the point that we no longer have any idea how computers work or how to talk to them.
And we do teach our kids how the human body works, we teach them how the combustion engine functions and we even tell them that if you want to really be an astronaut you can become one.
But when the kid comes to us and asks, "So, what is a bubble sort algorithm?"
Or, "How does the computer know what happens when I press 'play,' how does it know which video to show?"
Or, "Linda, is Internet a place?"
We adults, we grow oddly silent.
"It's magic," some of us say.
"It's too complicated," the others say.
Well, it's neither.
It's not magic and it's not complicated.
It all just happened really, really, really fast.
Computer scientists built these amazing, beautiful machines, but they made them very, very foreign to us, and also the language we speak to the computers so that we don't know how to speak to the computers anymore without our fancy user interfaces.
And that's why no one recognized that when I was conjugating French irregular verbs, I was actually practicing my pattern recognition skills.
And when I was excited about knitting, I actually was following a sequence of symbolic commands that included loops inside of them.
And that Bertrand Russell's lifelong quest to find an exact language between English and mathematics found its home inside of a computer.
I was a programmer, but no one knew it.
The kids of today, they tap, swipe and pinch their way through the world.
But unless we give them tools to build with computers, we are raising only consumers instead of creators.
This whole quest led me to this little girl.
Her name is Ruby, she is six years old.
She is completely fearless, imaginative and a little bit bossy.
And every time I would run into a problem in trying to teach myself programming like, "What is object-oriented design or what is garbage collection?", I would try to imagine how a six-year-old little girl would explain the problem.
And I wrote a book about her and I illustrated it and the things Ruby taught me go like this.
Ruby taught me that you're not supposed to be afraid of the bugs under your bed.
And even the biggest of the problems are a group of tiny problems stuck together.
And Ruby also introduced me to her friends, the colorful side of the Internet culture.
She has friends like the Snow Leopard, who is beautiful but doesn't want to play with the other kids.
And she has friends like the green robots that are really friendly but super messy.
And she has friends like Linux the penguin who's really ruthlessly efficient, but somewhat hard to understand.
And idealistic foxes, and so on.
In Ruby's world, you learn technology through play.
And, for instance, computers are really good at repeating stuff, so the way Ruby would teach loops goes like this.
This is Ruby's favorite dance move, it goes, "Clap, clap, stomp, stomp clap, clap and jump."
And you learn counter loops by repeating that four times.
And you learn while loops by repeating that sequence while I'm standing on one leg.
And you learn until loops by repeating that sequence until mom gets really mad.
(Laughter) And most of all, you learn that there are no ready answers.
When coming up with the curriculum for Ruby's world, I needed to really ask the kids how they see the world and what kind of questions they have and I would organize play testing sessions.
I would start by showing the kids these four pictures.
I would show them a picture of a car, a grocery store, a dog and a toilet.
And I would ask, "Which one of these do you think is a computer?"
And the kids would be very conservative and go, "None of these is a computer.
I know what a computer is: it's that glowing box in front of which mom or dad spends way too much time."
But then we would talk and we would discover that actually, a car is a computer, it has a navigation system inside of it.
And a dog -- a dog might not be a computer, but it has a collar and the collar might have a computer inside of it.
And grocery stores, they have so many different kinds of computers, like the cashier system and the burglar alarms.
And kids, you know what?
In Japan, toilets are computers and there's even hackers who hack them.
(Laughter) And we go further and I give them these little stickers with an on/off button on them.
And I tell the kids, "Today you have this magic ability to make anything in this room into a computer."
And again, the kids go, "Sounds really hard, I don't know the right answer for this."
But I tell them, "Don't worry, your parents don't know the right answer, either.
They've just started to hear about this thing called The Internet of Things.
But you kids, you are going to be the ones who are really going to live up in a world where everything is a computer."
And then I had this little girl who came to me and took a bicycle lamp and she said, "This bicycle lamp, if it were a computer, it would change colors."
And I said, "That's a really good idea, what else could it do?"
And she thinks and she thinks, and she goes, "If this bicycle lamp were a computer, we could go on a biking trip with my father and we would sleep in a tent and this biking lamp could also be a movie projector."
And that's the moment I'm looking for, the moment when the kid realizes that the world is definitely not ready yet, that a really awesome way of making the world more ready is by building technology and that each one of us can be a part of that change.
Final story, we also built a computer.
And we got to know the bossy CPU and the helpful RAM and ROM that help it remember things.
And after we've assembled our computer together, we also design an application for it.
And my favorite story is this little boy, he's six years old and his favorite thing in the world is to be an astronaut.
And the boy, he has these huge headphones on and he's completely immersed in his tiny paper computer because you see, he's built his own intergalactic planetary navigation application.
And his father, the lone astronaut in the Martian orbit, is on the other side of the room and the boy's important mission is to bring the father safely back to earth.
And these kids are going to have a profoundly different view of the world and the way we build it with technology.
Finally, the more approachable, the more inclusive, and the more diverse we make the world of technology, the more colorful and better the world will look like.
So, imagine with me, for a moment, a world where the stories we tell about how things get made don't only include the twentysomething-year-old Silicon Valley boys, but also Kenyan schoolgirls and Norwegian librarians.
Imagine a world where the little Ada Lovelaces of tomorrow, who live in a permanent reality of 1s and 0s, they grow up to be very optimistic and brave about technology.
They embrace the powers and the opportunities and the limitations of the world.
A world of technology that is wonderful, whimsical and a tiny bit weird.
When I was a girl, I wanted to be a storyteller.
I loved make-believe worlds and my favorite thing to do was to wake up in the mornings in Moominvalley.
In the afternoons, I would roam around the Tatooines.
And in the evenings, I would go to sleep in Narnia.
And programming turned out to be the perfect profession for me.
I still create worlds.
Instead of stories, I do them with code.
Programming gives me this amazing power to build my whole little universe with its own rules and paradigms and practices.
Create something out of nothing with the pure power of logic.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Humans have been fascinated with speed for ages.
The history of human progress is one of ever-increasing velocity, and one of the most important achievements in this historical race was the breaking of the sound barrier.
Not long after the first successful airplane flights, pilots were eager to push their planes to go faster and faster.
But as they did so, increased turbulence and large forces on the plane prevented them from accelerating further.
Some tried to circumvent the problem through risky dives, often with tragic results.
Finally, in 1947, design improvements, such as a movable horizontal stabilizer, the all-moving tail, allowed an American military pilot named Chuck Yeager to fly the Bell X-1 aircraft at 1127 km/h, becoming the first person to break the sound barrier and travel faster than the speed of sound.
The Bell X-1 was the first of many supersonic aircraft to follow, with later designs reaching speeds over Mach 3.
Aircraft traveling at supersonic speed create a shock wave with a thunder-like noise known as a sonic boom, which can cause distress to people and animals below or even damage buildings.
For this reason, scientists around the world have been looking at sonic booms, trying to predict their path in the atmosphere, where they will land, and how loud they will be.
To better understand how scientists study sonic booms, let's start with some basics of sound.
Imagine throwing a small stone in a still pond.
What do you see?
The stone causes waves to travel in the water at the same speed in every direction.
These circles that keep growing in radius are called wave fronts.
Similarly, even though we cannot see it, a stationary sound source, like a home stereo, creates sound waves traveling outward.
The speed of the waves depends on factors like the altitude and temperature of the air they move through.
At sea level, sound travels at about 1225 km/h.
But instead of circles on a two-dimensional surface, the wave fronts are now concentric spheres, with the sound traveling along rays perpendicular to these waves.
Now imagine a moving sound source, such as a train whistle.
As the source keeps moving in a certain direction, the successive waves in front of it will become bunched closer together.
This greater wave frequency is the cause of the famous Doppler effect, where approaching objects sound higher pitched.
But as long as the source is moving slower than the sound waves themselves, they will remain nested within each other.
It's when an object goes supersonic, moving faster than the sound it makes, that the picture changes dramatically.
As it overtakes sound waves it has emitted, while generating new ones from its current position, the waves are forced together, forming a Mach cone.
No sound is heard as it approaches an observer because the object is traveling faster than the sound it produces.
Only after the object has passed will the observer hear the sonic boom.
Where the Mach cone meets the ground, it forms a hyperbola, leaving a trail known as the boom carpet as it travels forward.
This makes it possible to determine the area affected by a sonic boom.
What about figuring out how strong a sonic boom will be?
This involves solving the famous Navier-Stokes equations to find the variation of pressure in the air due to the supersonic aircraft flying through it.
This results in the pressure signature known as the N-wave.
What does this shape mean?
Well, the sonic boom occurs when there is a sudden change in pressure, and the N-wave involves two booms: one for the initial pressure rise at the aircraft's nose, and another for when the tail passes, and the pressure suddenly returns to normal.
This causes a double boom, but it is usually heard as a single boom by human ears.
In practice, computer models using these principles can often predict the location and intensity of sonic booms for given atmospheric conditions and flight trajectories, and there is ongoing research to mitigate their effects.
In the meantime, supersonic flight over land remains prohibited.
So, are sonic booms a recent creation?
Not exactly.
While we try to find ways to silence them, a few other animals have been using sonic booms to their advantage.
The gigantic Diplodocus may have been capable of cracking its tail faster than sound, at over 1200 km/h, possibly to deter predators.
Some types of shrimp can also create a similar shock wave underwater, stunning or even killing pray at a distance with just a snap of their oversized claw.
So while we humans have made great progress in our relentless pursuit of speed, it turns out that nature was there first.
Nestled in the tissues of your neck is a small unassuming organ that wields enormous power over your body.
It's called the thyroid.
Like the operations manager in a company, its role is to make sure that the cells in your body are working properly.
It does that by using hormones to deliver messages to every single one of them.
This high-ranking organ is made up of lobules that each contains smaller cells called follicles, which store the hormones the thyroid sends out into your blood.
Two of the most important hormones it produces are thyroxine and triiodothyronine, or T3 and T4.
As messengers, the hormone's job is to instruct every cell in the body when to consume oxygen and nutrients.
That maintains the body's metabolism, the series of reactions our cells perform to provide us with energy.
This hormonal notification from the thyroid gets the heart pumping more efficiently, and makes our cells break down nutrients faster.
When you need more energy, the thyroid helps by sending out hormones to increase metabolism.
Ultimately, the thyroid allows our cells to use energy, grow and reproduce.
The thyroid is controlled by the pituitary gland, a hormonal gland deep in the brain that oversees the thyroid's tasks, making sure it knows when to send out its messengers.
The pituitary's role is to sense if hormone levels in the blood are too low or too high, in which case it sends out instructions in the form of the thyroid- stimulating hormone.
Even in this tightly controlled system, however, management sometimes slips up.
Certain diseases, growths in the thryoid or chemical imbalances in the body can confuse the organ and make it deaf to the pituitary's guiding commands.
The first problem this causes is hyperthyroidism, which happens when the organ sends out too many hormones.
That means the cells are overloaded with instructions to consume nutrients and oxygen.
They become overactive as a result, meaning a person with hyperthyroidism experiences a higher metabolism signaled by a faster heartbeat, constant hunger, and rapid weight loss.
They also feel hot, sweaty, anxious, and find it difficult to sleep.
The opposite problem is hypothyroidism, which happens when the thyroid sends out too few hormones, meaning the body's cells don't have as many messengers to guide them.
In response, cells grow listless and metabolism slows.
People with hypothyroidism see symptoms in weight gain, sluggishness, sensitivity to cold, swollen joints and feeling low.
Luckily, there are medical treatments that can help trigger the thyroid's activities again, and bring the body back to a steady metabolic rate.
For such a little organ, the thyroid wields an awful lot of power.
But a healthy thyroid manages our cells so effectively that it can keep us running smoothly without us even noticing it's there.
Melati Wijsen: Bali -- island of gods.
Isabel Wijsen: A green paradise.
MW: Or ...
a paradise lost.
Bali: island of garbage.
IW: In Bali, we generate 680 cubic meters of plastic garbage a day.
That's about a 14-story building.
And when it comes to plastic bags, less than five percent gets recycled.
MW: We know that changes the image you may have of our island.
It changed ours, too, when we learned about it, when we learned that almost all plastic bags in Bali end up in our drains and then in our rivers and then in our ocean.
And those that don't even make it to the ocean, they're either burned or littered.
IW: So we decided to do something about it.
And we've been working for almost three years now to try to say no to plastic bags on our home island.
And we have had some significant successes.
MW: We are sisters, and we go to the best school on earth: Green School, Bali.
Green School is not only different in the way that it is built out of bamboo, but also in the way that it teaches.
We are taught to become leaders of today, something a normal textbook cannot match.
IW: One day we had a lesson in class where we learned about significant people, like Nelson Mandela, Lady Diana and Mahatma Gandhi.
Walking home that day, we agreed that we also wanted to be significant.
Why should we wait until we were grown up to be significant?
We wanted to do something now.
MW: Sitting on the sofa that night, we brainstormed and thought of all the issues facing Bali.
And one thing that stood out to us the most was the plastic garbage.
But that is a huge problem.
So we looked into what was a realistic target for us kids: plastic bags.
And the idea was born.
IW: We started researching, and let's just say, the more we learned, there was nothing good about plastic bags.
And you know what?
We don't even need them.
MW: We were really inspired by the efforts to say no to plastic bags in many other places, from Hawaii to Rwanda and to severals cities like Oakland and Dublin.
IW: And so the idea turned into the launch of "Bye Bye Plastic Bags."
MW: In the years that we have been campaigning, we have learned a lot.
Lesson number one: you cannot do it all by yourself.
You need a big team of like-minded kids, and so we formed the Bye Bye Plastic Bags crew.
The volunteer team includes children from all over the island, from both international and local schools.
And together with them, we started a multi-layered approach, based on an on- and off-line signature petition, educational and inspirational presentations at schools and we raise general awareness at markets, festivals, beach clean-ups.
And last but not least, we distribute alternative bags, bags like net bags, recycled newspaper bags or 100 percent organic material bags, all made by local initiatives on the island.
IW: We run a pilot village, home of 800 families.
The village mayor was our first friend and he loved our T-shirts, so that helped.
We focused on making the customers aware, because that's where the change needs to happen.
The village is already two-thirds along the way of becoming plastic bag free.
Our first attempts to get the government of Bali on board failed.
So we thought, "Hmm ... a petition with one million signatures.
They can't ignore us, right?"
MW: Right!
IW: But, who would have guessed one million signatures is, like, a thousand times a thousand?
(Laughter) We got stuck -- till we learned lesson number two: think outside the box.
Someone mentioned that the Bali airport handles 16 million arrivals and departures a year.
MW: But how do we get into the airport?
And here comes lesson number three: persistence.
Off we headed to the airport.
We got past the janitor.
And then it was his boss's boss, and then the assistant office manager, and then the office manager, and then ...
we got shuffled down two levels and thought, well, here comes the janitor again.
And after several days knocking on doors and just being kids on a mission, we finally got to the commercial manager of Bali airports.
And we gave him the "Bali of plastic bags" speech, and being a very nice man, he said, [imitating the man's voice] "I cannot believe what I'm about say, but I'm going to give authorization to collect signatures behind customs and immigrations."
(Laughter) (Applause) IW: In our first hour and a half there, we got almost 1,000 signatures.
How cool is that?
Lesson number four: you need champions at all levels of society, from students to commercial managers to famous people.
And thanks to the attraction of Green School, we had access to a steady stream of celebrities.
Ban Ki Moon taught us that Secretary-Generals of the United Nations don't sign petitions -- (Laughter) even if kids ask nicely.
But he promised to spread the word, and now we work closely with the United Nations.
MW: Jane Goodall taught us the power of a people's network.
She started with just one Roots &amp; Shoots group and now she has 4,000 groups around the world.
We are one of them.
She's a real inspiration.
If you're a fellow Rotarian, nice to meet you.
We're Interactors, the youngest department of Rotary International.
IW: But we have also learned much about patience, MW: how to deal with frustrations, IW: leadership, MW: teamwork, IW: friendship, MW: we learned more about the Balinese and their culture IW: and we learned about the importance of commitment.
MW: It's not always easy.
Sometimes it does get a little bit hard to walk your talk.
IW: But last year, we did exactly that.
We went to India to give a talk, and our parents took us to visit the former private house of Mahatma Gandhi.
We learned about the power of hunger strikes he did to reach his goals.
Yes, by the end of the tour, when we met our parents again, we both made a decision and said, "We're going on a hunger strike!"
(Laughter) MW: And you can probably imagine their faces.
It took a lot of convincing, and not only to our parents but to our friends and to our teachers as well.
Isabel and I were serious about doing this.
So we met with a nutritionist, and we came up with a compromise of not eating from sunrise to sunset every day until the governor of Bali would agree to meet with us to talk about how to stop plastic bags on Bali.
IW: Our "mogak makan," as it is called in Bahasa Indonesia, started.
We used social media to support our goal and already on day two, police started to come to our home and school.
What were these two girls doing?
We knew we weren't making the governor look his best by doing this food strike -- we could have gone to jail.
But, hey, it worked.
Twenty-four hours later, we were picked up from school and escorted to the office of the governor.
MW: And there he was -- (Applause) waiting for us to meet and speak, being all supportive and thankful for our willingness to care for the beauty and the environment of Bali.
He signed a promise to help the people of Bali say no to plastic bags.
And we are now friends, and on a regular basis, we remind him and his team of the promises he has made.
And indeed, recently he stated and committed that Bali will be plastic bag free by 2018.
(Applause) IW: Also, at the International Airport of Bali, one of our supporters is planning to start a plastic bag-free policy by 2016.
MW: Stop handing out free plastic bags and bring in your own reusable bag is our next message to change that mindset of the public.
IW: Our short-term campaign, "One Island / One Voice," is all about this.
We check and recognize the shops and restaurants that have declared themselves a plastic bag-free zone, and we put this sticker at their entrance and publish their names on social media and some important magazines on Bali.
And conversely, that highlights those who do not have the sticker.
(Laughter) MW: So, why are we actually telling you all of this?
Well, partly, it is because we are proud of the results that, together with our team, we have been able to reach.
But also because along the way, we have learned that kids can do things.
We can make things happen.
Isabel and I were only 10 and 12 years old when we started this.
We never had a business plan, nor a fixed strategy, nor any hidden agendas -- just the idea in front of us and a group of friends working with us.
All we wanted to do was stop those plastic bags from wrapping and suffocating our beautiful home.
Kids have a boundless energy and a motivation to be the change the world needs.
IW: So to all the kids of this beautiful but challenging world: go for it!
Make that difference.
We're not telling you it's going to be easy.
We're telling you it's going to be worth it.
Us kids may only be 25 percent of the world's population, but we are 100 percent of the future.
MW: We still have a lot of work to do, but know that we still not stop until the first question asked when arriving at the Bali airports will be Both: "Welcome to Bali, do you have nay plastic bags to declare?"
(Laughter) Om shanti shanti shanti om.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Right now, you're probably sitting down to watch this video and staying seated for a few minutes to view it is probably okay.
But the longer you stay put, the more agitated your body becomes.
It sits there counting down the moments until you stand up again and take it for a walk.
That may sound ridiculous.
Our bodies love to sit, right?
Not really.
Sure, sitting for brief periods can help us recover from stress or recuperate from exercise.
But nowadays, our lifestyles make us sit much more than we move around, and our bodies simply aren't built for such a sedentary existence.
In fact, just the opposite is true.
The human body is built to move, and you can see evidence of that in the way it's structured.
Inside us are over 360 joints, and about 700 skeletal muscles that enable easy, fluid motion.
The body's unique physical structure gives us the ability to stand up straight against the pull of gravity.
Our blood depends on us moving around to be able to circulate properly.
Our nerve cells benefit from movement, and our skin is elastic, meaning it molds to our motions.
So if every inch of the body is ready and waiting for you to move, what happens when you just don't?
Let's start with the backbone of the problem, literally.
Your spine is a long structure made of bones and the cartilage discs that sit between them.
Joints, muscles and ligaments that are attached to the bones hold it all together.
A common way of sitting is with a curved back and slumped shoulders, a position that puts uneven pressure on your spine.
Over time, this causes wear and tear in your spinal discs, overworks certain ligaments and joints, and puts strain on muscles that stretch to accommodate your back's curved position.
This hunched shape also shrinks your chest cavity while you sit, meaning your lungs have less space to expand into when you breath.
That's a problem because it temporarily limits the amount of oxygen that fills your lungs and filters into your blood.
Around the skeleton are the muscles, nerves, arteries and veins that form the body's soft tissue layers.
The very act of sitting squashes, pressurizes and compresses, and these more delicate tissues really feel the brunt.
Have you ever experienced numbness and swelling in your limbs when you sit?
In areas that are the most compressed, your nerves, arteries and veins can become blocked, which limits nerve signaling, causing the numbness, and reduces blood flow in your limbs, causing them to swell.
Sitting for long periods also temporarily deactivates lipoprotein lipase, a special enzyme in the walls of blood capillaries that breaks down fats in the blood, so when you sit, you're not burning fat nearly as well as when you move around.
What effect does all of this stasis have on the brain?
Most of the time, you probably sit down to use your brain, but ironically, lengthy periods of sitting actually run counter to this goal.
Being stationary reduces blood flow and the amount of oxygen entering your blood stream through your lungs.
Your brain requires both of those things to remain alert, so your concentration levels will most likely dip as your brain activity slows.
Unfortunately, the ill effects of being seated don't only exist in the short term.
Recent studies have found that sitting for long periods is linked with some types of cancers and heart disease and can contribute to diabetes, kidney and liver problems.
In fact, researchers have worked out that, worldwide, inactivity causes about 9% of premature deaths a year.
That's over 5 million people.
So what seems like such a harmless habit actually has the power to change our health.
But luckily, the solutions to this mounting threat are simple and intuitive.
When you have no choice but to sit, try switching the slouch for a straighter spine, and when you don't have to be bound to your seat, aim to move around much more, perhaps by setting a reminder to yourself to get up every half hour.
But mostly, just appreciate that bodies are built for motion, not for stillness.
In fact, since the video's almost over, why not stand up and stretch right now?
Treat your body to a walk.
It'll thank you later.
When you think of Archimedes' "Eureka!" moment, you probably think of this.
As it turns out, it may have been more like this.
In the third century BC, Hieron, king of the Sicilian city of Syracuse, chose Archimedes to supervise an engineering project of unprecedented scale.
Hieron commissioned a sailing vessel 50 times bigger than a standard ancient warship, named the Syracusia after his city.
Hieron wanted to construct the largest ship ever, which was destined to be given as a present for Egypt's ruler, Ptolemy.
But could a boat the size of a palace possibly float?
In Archimedes's day, no one had attempted anything like this.
It was like asking, "Can a mountain fly?"
King Hieron had a lot riding on that question.
Hundreds of workmen were to labor for years on constructing the Syracusia out of beams of pine and fir from Mount Etna, ropes from hemp grown in Spain, and pitch from France.
The top deck, on which eight watchtowers were to stand, was to be supported not by columns, but by vast wooden images of Atlas holding the world on his shoulders.
On the ship's bow, a massive catapult would be able to fire 180 pound stone missiles.
For the enjoyment of its passengers, the ship was to feature a flower-lined promenade, a sheltered swimming pool, and bathhouse with heated water, a library filled with books and statues, a temple to the goddess Aphrodite, and a gymnasium.
And just to make things more difficult for Archimedes, Hieron intended to pack the vessel full of cargo: 400 tons of grain, 10,000 jars of pickled fish, 74 tons of drinking water, and 600 tons of wool.
It would have carried well over a thousand people on board, including 600 soldiers.
And it housed 20 horses in separate stalls.
To build something of this scale, only for that to sink on its maiden voyage?
Well, let's just say that failure wouldn't have been a pleasant option for Archimedes.
So he took on the problem: will it sink?
Perhaps he was sitting in the bathhouse one day, wondering how a heavy bathtub can float, when inspiration came to him.
An object partially immersed in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.
In other words, if a 2,000 ton Syracusia displaced exactly 2,000 tons of water, it would just barely float.
If it displaced 4,000 tons of water, it would float with no problem.
Of course, if it only displaced 1,000 tons of water, well, Hieron wouldn't be too happy.
This is the law of buoyancy, and engineers still call it Archimedes' Principle.
It explains why a steel supertanker can float as easily as a wooden rowboat or a bathtub.
If the weight of water displaced by the vessel below the keel is equivalent to the vessel's weight, whatever is above the keel will remain afloat above the waterline.
This sounds a lot like another story involving Archimedes and a bathtub, and it's possible that's because they're actually the same story, twisted by the vagaries of history.
The classical story of Archimedes' Eureka! and subsequent streak through the streets centers around a crown, or corona in Latin.
At the core of the Syracusia story is a keel, or korone in Greek.
Could one have been mixed up for the other?
We may never know.
On the day the Syracusia arrived in Egypt on its first and only voyage, we can only imagine how residents of Alexandria thronged the harbor to marvel at the arrival of this majestic, floating castle.
This extraordinary vessel was the Titanic of the ancient world, except without the sinking, thanks to our pal, Archimedes.
How does this music make you feel?
Do you find it beautiful?
Is it creative?
Now, would you change your answers if you learned the composer was this robot?
Believe it or not, people have been grappling with the question of artificial creativity, alongside the question of artifcial intelligence, for over 170 years.
In 1843, Lady Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician considered the world's first computer programmer, wrote that a machine could not have human-like intelligence as long as it only did what humans intentionally programmed it to do.
According to Lovelace, a machine must be able to create original ideas if it is to be considered intelligent.
The Lovelace Test, formalized in 2001, proposes a way of scrutinizing this idea.
A machine can pass this test if it can produce an outcome that its designers cannot explain based on their original code.
The Lovelace Test is, by design, more of a thought experiment than an objective scientific test.
But it's a place to start.
At first glance, the idea of a machine creating high quality, original music in this way might seem impossible.
We could come up with an extremely complex algorithm using random number generators, chaotic functions, and fuzzy logic to generate a sequence of musical notes in a way that would be impossible to track.
But although this would yield countless original melodies never heard before, only a tiny fraction of them would be worth listening to.
With the computer having no way to distinguish between those which we would consider beautiful and those which we won't.
But what if we took a step back and tried to model a natural process that allows creativity to form?
We happen to know of at least one such process that has lead to original, valuable, and even beautiful outcomes: the process of evolution.
And evolutionary algorithms, or genetic algorithms that mimic biological evolution, are one promising approach to making machines generate original and valuable artistic outcomes.
So how can evolution make a machine musically creative?
Well, instead of organisms, we can start with an initial population of musical phrases, and a basic algorithm that mimics reproduction and random mutations by switching some parts, combining others, and replacing random notes.
Now that we have a new generation of phrases, we can apply selection using an operation called a fitness function.
Just as biological fitness is determined by external environmental pressures, our fitness function can be determined by an external melody chosen by human musicians, or music fans, to represent the ultimate beautiful melody.
The algorithm can then compare between our musical phrases and that beautiful melody, and select only the phrases that are most similar to it.
Once the least similar sequences are weeded out, the algorithm can reapply mutation and recombination to what's left, select the most similar, or fitted ones, again from the new generation, and repeat for many generations.
The process that got us there has so much randomness and complexity built in that the result might pass the Lovelace Test.
More importantly, thanks to the presence of human aesthetic in the process, we'll theoretically generate melodies we would consider beautiful.
But does this satisfy our intuition for what is truly creative?
Is it enough to make something original and beautiful, or does creativity require intention and awareness of what is being created?
Perhaps the creativity in this case is really coming from the programmers, even if they don't understand the process.
What is human creativity, anyways?
Is it something more than a system of interconnected neurons developed by biological algorithmic processes and the random experiences that shape our lives?
Order and chaos, machine and human.
These are the dynamos at the heart of machine creativity initiatives that are currently making music, sculptures, paintings, poetry and more.
The jury may still be out as to whether it's fair to call these acts of creation creative.
But if a piece of art can make you weep, or blow your mind, or send shivers down your spine, does it really matter who or what created it?
This is Pleurobot.
Pleurobot is a robot that we designed to closely mimic a salamander species called Pleurodeles waltl.
Pleurobot can walk, as you can see here, and as you'll see later, it can also swim.
So you might ask, why did we design this robot?
And in fact, this robot has been designed as a scientific tool for neuroscience.
Indeed, we designed it together with neurobiologists to understand how animals move, and especially how the spinal cord controls locomotion.
But the more I work in biorobotics, the more I'm really impressed by animal locomotion.
If you think of a dolphin swimming or a cat running or jumping around, or even us as humans, when you go jogging or play tennis, we do amazing things.
And in fact, our nervous system solves a very, very complex control problem.
It has to coordinate more or less 200 muscles perfectly, because if the coordination is bad, we fall over or we do bad locomotion.
And my goal is to understand how this works.
There are four main components behind animal locomotion.
The first component is just the body, and in fact we should never underestimate to what extent the biomechanics already simplify locomotion in animals.
Then you have the spinal cord, and in the spinal cord you find reflexes, multiple reflexes that create a sensorimotor coordination loop between neural activity in the spinal cord and mechanical activity.
A third component are central pattern generators.
These are very interesting circuits in the spinal cord of vertebrate animals that can generate, by themselves, very coordinated rhythmic patterns of activity while receiving only very simple input signals.
And these input signals coming from descending modulation from higher parts of the brain, like the motor cortex, the cerebellum, the basal ganglia, will all modulate activity of the spinal cord while we do locomotion.
But what's interesting is to what extent just a low-level component, the spinal cord, together with the body, already solve a big part of the locomotion problem.
You probably know it by the fact that you can cut the head off a chicken, it can still run for a while, showing that just the lower part, spinal cord and body, already solve a big part of locomotion.
Now, understanding how this works is very complex, because first of all, recording activity in the spinal cord is very difficult.
It's much easier to implant electrodes in the motor cortex than in the spinal cord, because it's protected by the vertebrae.
Especially in humans, very hard to do.
A second difficulty is that locomotion is really due to a very complex and very dynamic interaction between these four components.
So it's very hard to find out what's the role of each over time.
This is where biorobots like Pleurobot and mathematical models can really help.
So what's biorobotics?
Biorobotics is a very active field of research in robotics where people want to take inspiration from animals to make robots to go outdoors, like service robots or search and rescue robots or field robots.
And the big goal here is to take inspiration from animals to make robots that can handle complex terrain -- stairs, mountains, forests, places where robots still have difficulties and where animals can do a much better job.
The robot can be a wonderful scientific tool as well.
There are some very nice projects where robots are used, like a scientific tool for neuroscience, for biomechanics or for hydrodynamics.
And this is exactly the purpose of Pleurobot.
So what we do in my lab is to collaborate with neurobiologists like Jean-Marie Cabelguen, a neurobiologist in Bordeaux in France, and we want to make spinal cord models and validate them on robots.
And here we want to start simple.
So it's good to start with simple animals like lampreys, which are very primitive fish, and then gradually go toward more complex locomotion, like in salamanders, but also in cats and in humans, in mammals.
And here, a robot becomes an interesting tool to validate our models.
And in fact, for me, Pleurobot is a kind of dream becoming true.
Like, more or less 20 years ago I was already working on a computer making simulations of lamprey and salamander locomotion during my PhD.
But I always knew that my simulations were just approximations.
Like, simulating the physics in water or with mud or with complex ground, it's very hard to simulate that properly on a computer.
Why not have a real robot and real physics?
So among all these animals, one of my favorites is the salamander.
You might ask why, and it's because as an amphibian, it's a really key animal from an evolutionary point of view.
It makes a wonderful link between swimming, as you find it in eels or fish, and quadruped locomotion, as you see in mammals, in cats and humans.
And in fact, the modern salamander is very close to the first terrestrial vertebrate, so it's almost a living fossil, which gives us access to our ancestor, the ancestor to all terrestrial tetrapods.
So the salamander swims by doing what's called an anguilliform swimming gait, so they propagate a nice traveling wave of muscle activity from head to tail.
And if you place the salamander on the ground, it switches to what's called a walking trot gait.
In this case, you have nice periodic activation of the limbs which are very nicely coordinated with this standing wave undulation of the body, and that's exactly the gait that you are seeing here on Pleurobot.
Now, one thing which is very surprising and fascinating in fact is the fact that all this can be generated just by the spinal cord and the body.
So if you take a decerebrated salamander -- it's not so nice but you remove the head -- and if you electrically stimulate the spinal cord, at low level of stimulation this will induce a walking-like gait.
If you stimulate a bit more, the gait accelerates.
And at some point, there's a threshold, and automatically, the animal switches to swimming.
This is amazing.
Just changing the global drive, as if you are pressing the gas pedal of descending modulation to your spinal cord, makes a complete switch between two very different gaits.
And in fact, the same has been observed in cats.
If you stimulate the spinal cord of a cat, you can switch between walk, trot and gallop.
Or in birds, you can make a bird switch between walking, at a low level of stimulation, and flapping its wings at high-level stimulation.
And this really shows that the spinal cord is a very sophisticated locomotion controller.
So we studied salamander locomotion in more detail, and we had in fact access to a very nice X-ray video machine from Professor Martin Fischer in Jena University in Germany.
And thanks to that, you really have an amazing machine to record all the bone motion in great detail.
That's what we did.
So we basically figured out which bones are important for us and collected their motion in 3D.
And what we did is collect a whole database of motions, both on ground and in water, to really collect a whole database of motor behaviors that a real animal can do.
And then our job as roboticists was to replicate that in our robot.
So we did a whole optimization process to find out the right structure, where to place the motors, how to connect them together, to be able to replay these motions as well as possible.
And this is how Pleurobot came to life.
So let's look at how close it is to the real animal.
So what you see here is almost a direct comparison between the walking of the real animal and the Pleurobot.
You can see that we have almost a one-to-one exact replay of the walking gait.
If you go backwards and slowly, you see it even better.
But even better, we can do swimming.
So for that we have a dry suit that we put all over the robot -- (Laughter) and then we can go in water and start replaying the swimming gaits.
And here, we were very happy, because this is difficult to do.
The physics of interaction are complex.
Our robot is much bigger than a small animal, so we had to do what's called dynamic scaling of the frequencies to make sure we had the same interaction physics.
But you see at the end, we have a very close match, and we were very, very happy with this.
So let's go to the spinal cord.
So here what we did with Jean-Marie Cabelguen is model the spinal cord circuits.
And what's interesting is that the salamander has kept a very primitive circuit, which is very similar to the one we find in the lamprey, this primitive eel-like fish, and it looks like during evolution, new neural oscillators have been added to control the limbs, to do the leg locomotion.
And we know where these neural oscillators are but what we did was to make a mathematical model to see how they should be coupled to allow this transition between the two very different gaits.
And we tested that on board of a robot.
And this is how it looks.
So what you see here is a previous version of Pleurobot that's completely controlled by our spinal cord model programmed on board of the robot.
And the only thing we do is send to the robot through a remote control the two descending signals it normally should receive from the upper part of the brain.
And what's interesting is, by playing with these signals, we can completely control speed, heading and type of gait.
For instance, when we stimulate at a low level, we have the walking gait, and at some point, if we stimulate a lot, very rapidly it switches to the swimming gait.
And finally, we can also do turning very nicely by just stimulating more one side of the spinal cord than the other.
And I think it's really beautiful how nature has distributed control to really give a lot of responsibility to the spinal cord so that the upper part of the brain doesn't need to worry about every muscle.
It just has to worry about this high-level modulation, and it's really the job of the spinal cord to coordinate all the muscles.
So now let's go to cat locomotion and the importance of biomechanics.
So this is another project where we studied cat biomechanics, and we wanted to see how much the morphology helps locomotion.
And we found three important criteria in the properties, basically, of the limbs.
The first one is that a cat limb more or less looks like a pantograph-like structure.
So a pantograph is a mechanical structure which keeps the upper segment and the lower segments always parallel.
So a simple geometrical system that kind of coordinates a bit the internal movement of the segments.
A second property of cat limbs is that they are very lightweight.
Most of the muscles are in the trunk, which is a good idea, because then the limbs have low inertia and can be moved very rapidly.
The last final important property is this very elastic behavior of the cat limb, so to handle impacts and forces.
And this is how we designed Cheetah-Cub.
So let's invite Cheetah-Cub onstage.
So this is Peter Eckert, who does his PhD on this robot, and as you see, it's a cute little robot.
It looks a bit like a toy, but it was really used as a scientific tool to investigate these properties of the legs of the cat.
So you see, it's very compliant, very lightweight, and also very elastic, so you can easily press it down and it will not break.
It will just jump, in fact.
And this very elastic property is also very important.
And you also see a bit these properties of these three segments of the leg as pantograph.
Now, what's interesting is that this quite dynamic gait is obtained purely in open loop, meaning no sensors, no complex feedback loops.
And that's interesting, because it means that just the mechanics already stabilized this quite rapid gait, and that really good mechanics already basically simplify locomotion.
To the extent that we can even disturb a bit locomotion, as you will see in the next video, where we can for instance do some exercise where we have the robot go down a step, and the robot will not fall over, which was a surprise for us.
This is a small perturbation.
I was expecting the robot to immediately fall over, because there are no sensors, no fast feedback loop.
But no, just the mechanics stabilized the gait, and the robot doesn't fall over.
Obviously, if you make the step bigger, and if you have obstacles, you need the full control loops and reflexes and everything.
But what's important here is that just for small perturbation, the mechanics are right.
And I think this is a very important message from biomechanics and robotics to neuroscience, saying don't underestimate to what extent the body already helps locomotion.
Now, how does this relate to human locomotion?
Clearly, human locomotion is more complex than cat and salamander locomotion, but at the same time, the nervous system of humans is very similar to that of other vertebrates.
And especially the spinal cord is also the key controller for locomotion in humans.
That's why, if there's a lesion of the spinal cord, this has dramatic effects.
The person can become paraplegic or tetraplegic.
This is because the brain loses this communication with the spinal cord.
Especially, it loses this descending modulation to initiate and modulate locomotion.
So a big goal of neuroprosthetics is to be able to reactivate that communication using electrical or chemical stimulations.
And there are several teams in the world that do exactly that, especially at EPFL.
My colleagues Grégoire Courtine and Silvestro Micera, with whom I collaborate.
But to do this properly, it's very important to understand how the spinal cord works, how it interacts with the body, and how the brain communicates with the spinal cord.
This is where the robots and models that I've presented today will hopefully play a key role towards these very important goals.
Thank you.
(Applause) Bruno Giussani: Auke, I've seen in your lab other robots that do things like swim in pollution and measure the pollution while they swim.
But for this one, you mentioned in your talk, like a side project, search and rescue, and it does have a camera on its nose.
Auke Ijspeert: Absolutely. So the robot -- We have some spin-off projects where we would like to use the robots to do search and rescue inspection, so this robot is now seeing you.
And the big dream is to, if you have a difficult situation like a collapsed building or a building that is flooded, and this is very dangerous for a rescue team or even rescue dogs, why not send in a robot that can crawl around, swim, walk, with a camera onboard to do inspection and identify survivors and possibly create a communication link with the survivor.
BG: Of course, assuming the survivors don't get scared by the shape of this.
AI: Yeah, we should probably change the appearance quite a bit, because here I guess a survivor might die of a heart attack just of being worried that this would feed on you.
But by changing the appearance and it making it more robust, I'm sure we can make a good tool out of it.
BG: Thank you very much. Thank you and your team.
There is a curse that has plagued humanity since ancient times.
The Greeks fought it by chewing aromatic resins, while the Chinese resorted to egg shells.
In the ancient Jewish Talmud, it's even considered legal grounds for divorce.
This horrible scourge is halitosis, otherwise known as bad breath.
But what causes it, and why is it so universally terrifying?
Well, think of some of the worst odors you can imagine, like garbage, feces or rotting meat.
All of these smells come from the activity of microorganisms, particularly bacteria, and, as disgusting as it may sound, similar bacteria live in the moisture-rich environment of your mouth.
Don't panic.
The presence of bacteria in your body is not only normal, it's actually vital for all sorts of things, like digestion and disease prevention.
But like all living things, bacteria need to eat.
The bacteria in your mouth feed off of mucus, food remnants, and dead tissue cells.
In order to absorb nutrients through their cell membranes, they must break down the organic matter into much smaller molecules.
For example, they'll break proteins into their component amino acids and then break those down even further into various compounds.
Some of the foul-smelling byproducts of these reactions, such as hydrogen sulfide and cadaverine, escape into the air and waft their way towards unsuspecting noses.
Our sensitivity to these odors and interpretation of them as bad smells may be an evolutionary mechanism warning us of rotten food and the presence of disease.
Smell is one of our most intimate and primal senses, playing a huge role in our attraction to potential mates.
In one poll, 59% of men and 70% of women said they wouldn't go on a date with someone who has bad breath, which may be why Americans alone spend $1 billion a year on various breath products.
Fortunately, most bad breath is easily treated.
The worst smelling byproducts come from gram-negative bacteria that live in the spaces between gums and teeth and on the back of the tongue.
By brushing and flossing our teeth, using antibacterial mouthwash at bedtime, gently cleaning the back of the tongue with a plastic scraper and even just eating a healthy breakfast, we can remove many of these bacteria and their food sources.
In some cases, these measures may not be enough due to dental problems, nasal conditions, or rarer ailments, such as liver disease and uncontrolled diabetes.
Behaviors like smoking and excessive alcohol consumption also have a very recognizable odor.
Regardless of cause, the bad smell almost always originates in the mouth and not the stomach or elsewhere in the body.
But one of the biggest challenges lies in actually determining how our breath smells in the first place, and it's unclear why.
It may be that we're too acclimatized to the smell inside our own mouths to judge it.
And methods like cupping your hands over your mouth, or licking and smelling your wrist don't work perfectly either.
One study showed that even when people do this, they tend to rate the smell subjectively according to how bad they thought it was going to be.
But there's one simple, if socially difficult, way of finding out how your breath smells: just take a deep breath and ask a friend.
As the story goes, the legendary marksman William Tell was forced into a cruel challenge by a corrupt lord.
William's son was to be executed unless William could shoot an apple off his head.
William succeeded, but let's imagine two variations on the tale.
In the first variation, the lord hires a bandit to steal William's trusty crossbow, so he is forced to borrow an inferior one from a peasant.
However, the borrowed crossbow isn't adjusted perfectly, and William finds that his practice shots cluster in a tight spread beneath the bullseye.
Fortunately, he has time to correct for it before it's too late.
Variation two: William begins to doubt his skills in the long hours before the challenge and his hand develops a tremor.
His practice shots still cluster around the apple but in a random pattern.
Occasionally, he hits the apple, but with the wobble, there is no guarantee of a bullseye.
He must settle his nervous hand and restore the certainty in his aim to save his son.
At the heart of these variations are two terms often used interchangeably: accuracy and precision.
The distinction between the two is actually critical for many scientific endeavours.
Accuracy involves how close you come to the correct result.
Your accuracy improves with tools that are calibrated correctly and that you're well-trained on.
Precision, on the other hand, is how consistently you can get that result using the same method.
Your precision improves with more finely incremented tools that require less estimation.
The story of the stolen crossbow was one of precision without accuracy.
William got the same wrong result each time he fired.
The variation with the shaky hand was one of accuracy without precision.
William's bolts clustered around the correct result, but without certainty of a bullseye for any given shot.
You can probably get away with low accuracy or low precision in everyday tasks.
But engineers and researchers often require accuracy on microscopic levels with a high certainty of being right every time.
Factories and labs increase precision through better equipment and more detailed procedures.
These improvements can be expensive, so managers must decide what the acceptable uncertainty for each project is.
However, investments in precision can take us beyond what was previously possible, even as far as Mars.
It may surprise you that NASA does not know exactly where their probes are going to touch down on another planet.
Predicting where they will land requires extensive calculations fed by measurements that don't always have a precise answer.
How does the Martian atmosphere's density change at different elevations?
What angle will the probe hit the atmosphere at?
What will be the speed of the probe upon entry?
Computer simulators run thousands of different landing scenarios, mixing and matching values for all of the variables.
Weighing all the possibilities, the computer spits out the potential area of impact in the form of a landing ellipse.
In 1976, the landing ellipse for the Mars Viking Lander was 62 x 174 miles, nearly the area of New Jersey.
With such a limitation, NASA had to ignore many interesting but risky landing areas.
Since then, new information about the Martian atmosphere, improved spacecraft technology, and more powerful computer simulations have drastically reduced uncertainty.
In 2012, the landing ellipse for the Curiosity Lander was only 4 miles wide by 12 miles long, an area more than 200 times smaller than Viking's.
This allowed NASA to target a specific spot in Gale Crater, a previously un-landable area of high scientific interest.
While we ultimately strive for accuracy, precision reflects our certainty of reliably achieving it.
With these two principles in mind, we can shoot for the stars and be confident of hitting them every time.
It's so obvious that it's practically proverbial.
You can't unboil an egg.
Well, it turns out you can, sort of.
What thermal energy does to the eggs' molecules, mechanical energy can undo.
Eggs are mostly made of water and proteins.
The proteins start off folded up into intricate shapes, held together by weak chemical bonds.
Adding heat disrupts those bonds, allowing the proteins to unfold, uncoil, unwind and wiggle freely.
This process is called denaturing.
The newly liberated proteins bump up against their neighbors and start to form new bonds with each other, more and more as the heat increases, until finally, they're so entangled that they gel into a solid mass, a boiled egg.
That entanglement might look permanent, but it's not.
According to a chemical idea called the principle of microscopic reversibility, anything that happens, like egg proteins seizing up, can theoretically unhappen if you retrace your steps.
But adding more heat will tangle the proteins further, and cooling them down will only freeze them, so here's the trick: spin them around ridiculously fast.
I'm not kidding.
Here's how it works.
First, scientists dissolve boiled egg whites in water with a chemical called urea, a small molecule that acts as a lubricant, coating the proteins' long strands and making it easier for them to glide past each other.
Then, they spin that solution in a glass tube at a breakneck 5000 rotations per minute, making the solution spread out into a thin film.
Here's the key part.
The solution nearest the wall spins faster than the solution closer to the middle.
That difference in velocity creates sheer stresses that repeatedly stretch and contract the proteins until eventually they snap back into their native shapes and stay there.
By the time the centrifuge stops spinning, the egg white is back in its original unboiled state.
This technique works with all sorts of proteins.
Bigger, messier proteins can be more resistant to being pulled apart, so scientists attach a plastic bead to one end that adds extra stress and encourages it to fold up first.
This unboiling method won't work with a whole egg in its shell since the solution has to spread throughout a cylindrical chamber.
But the applications go way beyond uncooking your breakfast, anyhow.
Many pharmaceuticals consist of proteins that are extremely expensive to produce, partly because they get stuck in tangled up aggregates, just like cooked egg whites and have to be untangled and refolded before they can do their jobs.
This spinning technique has the potential to be an easier, cheaper and quicker method than other ways to refold proteins, so it may allow new drugs to be made available to more people faster.
And there's one more thing you need to keep in mind before trying to uncook all of your food.
Boiling an egg is actually an unusual cooking process because even though it changes the way proteins are shaped and bound together, it doesn't actually change their chemical identity.
Most types of cooking are more like the famous Maillard reaction, which makes chemical changes that turn sugars and proteins into delicious caramel crunchiness and are a lot harder to undo.
So you might be able to unboil your egg, but I'm sorry to say you can't unfry it...yet.
There is nothing bigger or older than the universe.
The questions I would like to talk about are: one, where did we come from?
How did the universe come into being?
Is there alien life out there?
What is the future of the human race?
Up until the 1920s, everyone thought the universe was essentially static and unchanging in time.
Then it was discovered that the universe was expanding.
Distant galaxies were moving away from us.
If we extrapolate back, we find we must have all been on top of each other about 15 billion years ago.
But was there anything before the Big Bang?
If not, what created the universe?
Why did the universe emerge from the Big Bang the way it did?
We used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts.
First, there were the laws like Maxwell's equations and general relativity that determined the evolution of the universe, given its state over all of space at one time.
And second, there was no question of the initial state of the universe.
We have made good progress on the first part, and now have the knowledge of the laws of evolution in all but the most extreme conditions.
But until recently, we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe.
However, this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct.
Under extreme conditions, general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space.
This removes the distinction between time and space, and means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state.
The universe can spontaneously create itself out of nothing.
Moreover, we can calculate a probability that the universe was created in different states.
These predictions are in excellent agreement with observations by the WMAP satellite of the cosmic microwave background, which is an imprint of the very early universe.
We think we have solved the mystery of creation.
Maybe we should patent the universe and charge everyone royalties for their existence.
I now turn to the second big question: are we alone, or is there other life in the universe?
We believe that life arose spontaneously on the Earth, so it must be possible for life to appear on other suitable planets, of which there seem to be a large number in the galaxy.
We have two pieces of observational evidence on the probability of life appearing.
The first is that we have fossils of algae from 3.5 billion years ago.
The Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years.
So life appeared on Earth within half a billion years of it being possible, which is short compared to the 10-billion-year lifetime of a planet of Earth type.
This suggests that the probability of life appearing is reasonably high.
If it was very low, one would have expected it to take most of the ten billion years available.
On the other hand, we don't seem to have been visited by aliens.
I am discounting the reports of UFOs.
If there is a government conspiracy to suppress the reports and keep for itself the scientific knowledge the aliens bring, it seems to have been a singularly ineffective policy so far.
Furthermore, despite an extensive search by the SETI project, we haven't heard any alien television quiz shows.
This probably indicates that there are no alien civilizations at our stage of development within a radius of a few hundred light years.
Issuing an insurance policy against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet.
This brings me to the last of the big questions: the future of the human race.
If we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy, we should make sure we survive and continue.
But we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history.
Our population and our use of the finite resources of planet Earth are growing exponentially, along with our technical ability to change the environment for good or ill.
But our genetic code still carries the selfish and aggressive instincts that were of survival advantage in the past.
It will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred years, let alone the next thousand or million.
Our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain inward-looking on planet Earth, but to spread out into space.
The answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years.
But if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years, our future is in space.
That is why I am in favor of manned -- or should I say, personned -- space flight.
All of my life I have sought to understand the universe and find answers to these questions.
I have been very lucky that my disability has not been a serious handicap.
Indeed, it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge.
The ultimate goal is a complete theory of the universe, and we are making good progress.
Chris Anderson: Professor, if you had to guess either way, do you now believe that it is more likely than not that we are alone in the Milky Way, as a civilization of our level of intelligence or higher?
This answer took seven minutes, and really gave me an insight into the incredible act of generosity this whole talk was for TED.
Stephen Hawking: I think it quite likely that we are the only civilization within several hundred light years; otherwise we would have heard radio waves.
The alternative is that civilizations don't last very long, but destroy themselves.
We will take it as a salutary warning, I think, for the rest of our conference this week.
Professor, we really thank you for the extraordinary effort you made to share your questions with us today.
Thank you very much indeed.
When I was first learning to meditate, the instruction was to simply pay attention to my breath, and when my mind wandered, to bring it back.
Sounded simple enough.
Yet I'd sit on these silent retreats, sweating through T-shirts in the middle of winter.
I'd take naps every chance I got because it was really hard work.
Actually, it was exhausting.
The instruction was simple enough but I was missing something really important.
So why is it so hard to pay attention?
Well, studies show that even when we're really trying to pay attention to something -- like maybe this talk -- at some point, about half of us will drift off into a daydream, or have this urge to check our Twitter feed.
So what's going on here?
It turns out that we're fighting one of the most evolutionarily-conserved learning processes currently known in science, one that's conserved back to the most basic nervous systems known to man.
This reward-based learning process is called positive and negative reinforcement, and basically goes like this.
We see some food that looks good, our brain says, "Calories! ... Survival!"
We eat the food, we taste it -- it tastes good.
And especially with sugar, our bodies send a signal to our brain that says, "Remember what you're eating and where you found it."
We lay down this context-dependent memory and learn to repeat the process next time.
See food, eat food, feel good, repeat.
Trigger, behavior, reward.
Simple, right?
Well, after a while, our creative brains say, "You know what?
You can use this for more than just remembering where food is.
You know, next time you feel bad, why don't you try eating something good so you'll feel better?"
We thank our brains for the great idea, try this and quickly learn that if we eat chocolate or ice cream when we're mad or sad, we feel better.
Same process, just a different trigger.
Instead of this hunger signal coming from our stomach, this emotional signal -- feeling sad -- triggers that urge to eat.
Maybe in our teenage years, we were a nerd at school, and we see those rebel kids outside smoking and we think, "Hey, I want to be cool."
So we start smoking.
The Marlboro Man wasn't a dork, and that was no accident.
See cool, smoke to be cool, feel good. Repeat.
Trigger, behavior, reward.
And each time we do this, we learn to repeat the process and it becomes a habit.
So later, feeling stressed out triggers that urge to smoke a cigarette or to eat something sweet.
Now, with these same brain processes, we've gone from learning to survive to literally killing ourselves with these habits.
Obesity and smoking are among the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in the world.
So back to my breath.
What if instead of fighting our brains, or trying to force ourselves to pay attention, we instead tapped into this natural, reward-based learning process ...
but added a twist?
What if instead we just got really curious about what was happening in our momentary experience?
I'll give you an example.
In my lab, we studied whether mindfulness training could help people quit smoking.
Now, just like trying to force myself to pay attention to my breath, they could try to force themselves to quit smoking.
And the majority of them had tried this before and failed -- on average, six times.
Now, with mindfulness training, we dropped the bit about forcing and instead focused on being curious.
In fact, we even told them to smoke.
What? Yeah, we said, "Go ahead and smoke, just be really curious about what it's like when you do."
And what did they notice?
Well here's an example from one of our smokers.
She said, "Mindful smoking: smells like stinky cheese and tastes like chemicals, YUCK!"
Now, she knew, cognitively that smoking was bad for her, that's why she joined our program.
What she discovered just by being curiously aware when she smoked was that smoking tastes like shit.
(Laughter) Now, she moved from knowledge to wisdom.
She moved from knowing in her head that smoking was bad for her to knowing it in her bones, and the spell of smoking was broken.
She started to become disenchanted with her behavior.
Now, the prefrontal cortex, that youngest part of our brain from an evolutionary perspective, it understands on an intellectual level that we shouldn't smoke.
And it tries its hardest to help us change our behavior, to help us stop smoking, to help us stop eating that second, that third, that fourth cookie.
We call this cognitive control.
We're using cognition to control our behavior.
Unfortunately, this is also the first part of our brain that goes offline when we get stressed out, which isn't that helpful.
Now, we can all relate to this in our own experience.
We're much more likely to do things like yell at our spouse or kids when we're stressed out or tired, even though we know it's not going to be helpful.
We just can't help ourselves.
When the prefrontal cortex goes offline, we fall back into our old habits, which is why this disenchantment is so important.
Seeing what we get from our habits helps us understand them at a deeper level -- to know it in our bones so we don't have to force ourselves to hold back or restrain ourselves from behavior.
We're just less interested in doing it in the first place.
And this is what mindfulness is all about: Seeing really clearly what we get when we get caught up in our behaviors, becoming disenchanted on a visceral level and from this disenchanted stance, naturally letting go.
This isn't to say that, poof, magically we quit smoking.
But over time, as we learn to see more and more clearly the results of our actions, we let go of old habits and form new ones.
The paradox here is that mindfulness is just about being really interested in getting close and personal with what's actually happening in our bodies and minds from moment to moment.
This willingness to turn toward our experience rather than trying to make unpleasant cravings go away as quickly as possible.
And this willingness to turn toward our experience is supported by curiosity, which is naturally rewarding.
What does curiosity feel like?
It feels good.
And what happens when we get curious?
We start to notice that cravings are simply made up of body sensations -- oh, there's tightness, there's tension, there's restlessness -- and that these body sensations come and go.
These are bite-size pieces of experiences that we can manage from moment to moment rather than getting clobbered by this huge, scary craving that we choke on.
In other words, when we get curious, we step out of our old, fear-based, reactive habit patterns, and we step into being.
We become this inner scientist where we're eagerly awaiting that next data point.
Now, this might sound too simplistic to affect behavior.
But in one study, we found that mindfulness training was twice as good as gold standard therapy at helping people quit smoking.
So it actually works.
And when we studied the brains of experienced meditators, we found that parts of a neural network of self-referential processing called the default mode network were at play.
Now, one current hypothesis is that a region of this network, called the posterior cingulate cortex, is activated not necessarily by craving itself but when we get caught up in it, when we get sucked in, and it takes us for a ride.
In contrast, when we let go -- step out of the process just by being curiously aware of what's happening -- this same brain region quiets down.
Now we're testing app and online-based mindfulness training programs that target these core mechanisms and, ironically, use the same technology that's driving us to distraction to help us step out of our unhealthy habit patterns of smoking, of stress eating and other addictive behaviors.
Now, remember that bit about context-dependent memory?
We can deliver these tools to peoples' fingertips in the contexts that matter most.
So we can help them tap into their inherent capacity to be curiously aware right when that urge to smoke or stress eat or whatever arises.
So if you don't smoke or stress eat, maybe the next time you feel this urge to check your email when you're bored, or you're trying to distract yourself from work, or maybe to compulsively respond to that text message when you're driving, see if you can tap into this natural capacity, just be curiously aware of what's happening in your body and mind in that moment.
It will just be another chance to perpetuate one of our endless and exhaustive habit loops ...
or step out of it.
Instead of see text message, compulsively text back, feel a little bit better -- notice the urge, get curious, feel the joy of letting go and repeat.
Thank you.
(Applause)
How much would you pay for a bouquet of tulips?
A few dollars? A hundred dollars?
How about a million dollars?
Probably not.
Well, how much would you pay for this house, or partial ownership of a website that sells pet supplies?
At different points in time, tulips, real estate and stock in pets.com have all sold for much more than they were worth.
In each instance, the price rose and rose and then abruptly plummeted.
Economists call this a bubble.
So what is exactly is going on with a bubble?
Well, let's start with the tulips to get a better idea.
The 17th century saw the Netherlands enter the Dutch golden age.
By the 1630s, Amsterdam was an important port and commercial center.
Dutch ships imported spices from Asia in huge quantities to earn profits in Europe.
So Amsterdam was brimming with wealthy, skilled merchants and traders who displayed their prosperity by living in mansions surrounded by flower gardens.
And there was one flower in particularly high demand: the tulip.
The tulip was brought to Europe on trading vessels that sailed from the East.
Because of this, it was considered an exotic flower that was also difficult to grow, since it could take years for a single tulip to bloom.
During the 1630s, an outbreak of tulip breaking virus made select flowers even more beautiful by lining petals with multicolor, flame-like streaks.
A tulip like this was scarcer than a normal tulip and as a result, prices for these flowers started to rise, and with them, the tulip's popularity.
It wasn't long before the tulip became a nationwide sensation and tulip mania was born.
A mania occurs when there is an upward movement of price combined with a willingness to pay large sums of money for something valued much lower in intrinsic value.
A recent example of this is the dot-com mania of the 1990s.
Stocks in new, exciting websites were like the tulips of the 17th century.
Everybody wanted some.
The more people who wanted the tulip, the higher the price could go.
At one point, a single tulip bulb sold for more than ten times the annual salary of a skilled craftsman.
In the stock market, the price of stock is based on the supply and demand of investors.
Stock prices tend to rise when it seems like a company will earn more in the future.
Investors might then buy more of the stock, raising the prices even further due to an increased demand.
This can result in a feedback loop where investors get caught up in the hype and ultimately drive prices far above intrinsic value, creating a bubble.
All that is needed for a mania to end and for a bubble to burst is the collective realization that the price of the stock, or a tulip, far exceeds its worth.
That's what happened with both manias.
Suddenly the demand ended.
Prices were pushed to staggering lows, and pop!
The bubbles burst, and the market crashed.
Today, scholars work long and hard trying to predict what causes a bubble and how to avoid them.
Tulip mania is an effective illustration of the underlying principles at work in a bubble and can help us understand more recent examples like the real estate bubble of the late 2000s.
The economy will continue to go through phases of booms and busts.
So while we wait for the next mania to start, and the next bubble to burst, treat yourself to a bouquet of tulips and enjoy the fact that you didn't have to pay an arm and a leg for them.
What's that sound?
Depending on whom you ask, the crackle of popping joints is either the sound of sweet relief or the noxious tones of a stomach-turning habit.
Really, though. What's that sound?
I mean, why does bending your joints in a certain way make them pop like that?
Scientists have offered several explanations, including rapidly stretching ligaments, and in severe cases, actual bones grinding against each other.
But the most common explanation for why your stretched-out joints sound like bubbles popping is that, well, there are bubbles in there.
The joints in your fingers are the easiest ones to crack, but many people also crack the joints between vertebrae in their neck and back, and even their hips, wrists, shoulders and so on.
All these joints are synovial joints, and they're the most flexible ones in your body.
The space between the two bones is filled with a viscous liquid, synovial fluid, which contains long, lubricating molecules, like hyaluronic acid and lubricin.
Synovial fluid is more or less the texture of egg yolk and its primary purpose is to cushion the bones and help them glide past each other.
It also contains phagocytic cells that help clean up any bone or cartilage debris that ends up in the joint.
But the reason it's important for knuckle cracking is that, like other fluids in your body, it contains lots of dissolved gas molecules.
Knuckle-crackers know that to get that satisfying pop, you stretch the joint farther than it normally goes by bending your fingers backwards, for example.
When you do that, the bones move away from each other.
The space between bones gets bigger, but the amount of synovial fluid stays constant.
That creates a low-pressure zone that pulls dissolved gases out of the synovial fluid, just like the carbon dioxide that fizzes out of soda when you twist open the cap.
Inside the joint, the escaping gases form a bubble with a pop.
But the bubble doesn't last long.
The surrounding fluid presses on it until it finally collapses.
The bubble's gases scatter throughout the synovial cavity and slowly dissolve back into the fluid over the course of about twenty minutes, which is why it can take a while before you can pop the same joint again.
Some scientists think there may actually be two pops.
One when the bubble forms, and another when it bursts.
Popping a joint temporarily enlarges it, which may be why dedicated knuckle-, neck- and back-crackers say the habit makes their joints feel looser and more flexible.
But you may have heard from a concerned relative or annoyed officemate that cracking your joints will give you arthritis.
A doctor named Donald Unger heard this, too.
So, determined to disprove his mother's warnings, he cracked the knuckles of his left hand repeatedly for 50 years, while the right-hand knuckles went unpopped.
36,500 cracks later, both hands were arthritis-free.
For this selfless act of devotion to science, Dr. Unger received an Ig Nobel Prize, a parody of the Nobel Prize that recognizes wacky, but weirdly fascinating, scientific accomplishments.
Unger wrote that his results should prompt investigation into other parental beliefs, like the importance of eating spinach.
The jury's still out on that one.
As for knuckle-cracking, one study suggests that all that joint stretching and bubble bursting can cause your hands to swell and weaken your grip.
But the biggest proven danger seems to be annoying those around you.
As far as we know, Medieval England was never invaded by ice zombies, or terrorized by dragons, but it was shaken by a power struggle between two noble families spanning generations and involving a massive cast of characters with complex motives and shifting loyalties.
If that sounds familiar, it's because the historical conflicts known as the Wars of the Roses served as the basis for much of the drama in Game of Thrones.
The real-life seeds of war were sewn by the death of King Edward III in 1377.
Edward's oldest son had died before his father, but his ten-year-old son, Richard II, succeeded to the throne ahead of Edward's three surviving sons.
This skipping of an entire generation left lingering claims to the throne among their various offspring, particularly the Lancasters, descended from Edward's third son, and the Yorks, descended from his fourth son.
The name of the ensuing wars comes from the symbols associated with the two families, the white rose of York and the red rose of Lancaster.
The Lancasters first gained the throne when Richard II was deposed by his cousin Henry IV in 1399.
Despite sporadic unrest, their reign remained secure until 1422, when Henry V's death in a military campaign left an infant Henry VI as king.
Weak-willed and dominated by advisors, Henry was eventually convinced to marry Margaret of Anjou to gain French support.
Margaret was beautiful, ambitious, and ruthless in persecuting any threat to her power, and she distrusted Richard of York, most of all.
York had been the King's close advisor and loyal General, but was increasingly sidelined by the Queen, who promoted her favorite supporters, like the Earls of Suffolk and Somerset.
York's criticism of their inept handling of the war against France led to his exclusion from court and transfer to Ireland.
Meanwhile, mounting military failures, and corrupt rule by Margaret and her allies caused widespread discontent, and in the midst of this chaos, Richard of York returned with an army to arrest Somerset and reform the court.
Initially unsuccessful, he soon got his chance when he was appointed Protector of the Realm after Henry suffered a mental breakdown.
However, less than a year later, Henry suddendly recovered and the Queen convinced him to reverse York's reforms.
York fled and raised an army once more.
Though he was unable to directly seize the throne, he managed to be reinstated as Protector and have himself and his heirs designated to succeed Henry.
But instead of a crown, York's head acquired a pike after he was killed in battle with the Queen's loyalists.
His young son took up the claim and was crowned Edward IV.
Edward enjoyed great military success against the Lancasters.
Henry was captured, while Margaret fled into exile with their reportedly cruel son, Edward of Westminster.
But the newly crowned King made a tragic political mistake by backing out of his arranged marriage with a French Princess to secretly marry the widow of a minor Noble.
This alienated his most powerful ally, the Earl of Warwick.
Warwick allied with the Lancasters, turned Edward's jealous younger brother, George, against him, and even briefly managed to restore Henry as King, but it didn't last.
Edward recaptured the throne, the Lancaster Prince was killed in battle, and Henry himself died in captivity not long after.
The rest of Edward IV's reign was peaceful, but upon his death in 1483, the bloodshed resumed.
Though his twelve-year-old son was due to succeed him, Edward's younger brother Richard III declared his nephews illegitimate due to their father's secret marriage.
He assumed the regency himself and threw the boys in prison.
Though no one knows what ultimately became of them, after a while, the Princes disappeared and Richard's power seemed secure.
But his downfall would come only two years later from across the narrow sea of the English Channel.
Henry Tudor was a direct descendant of the first Duke of Lancaster, raised in exile after his father's death in a previous rebellion.
With Richard III's power grab causing a split in the York faction, Henry won support for his royal claim.
Raising an army in France, he crossed the Channel in 1485 and quickly defeated Richard's forces.
And by marrying Elizabeth of York, elder sister of the disappeared Princes, the newly crowned Henry VII joined the two roses, finally ending nearly a century of war.
We often think of historical wars as decisive conflicts with clearly defined winners and losers.
But the Wars of the Roses, like the fiction they inspired, show us that victories can be uncertain, alliances unstable, and even the power of Kings as fleeting as the seasons.
If someone asked you who the richest people in history were, who would you name?
Perhaps a billionaire banker or corporate mogul, like Bill Gates or John D. Rockefeller.
How about African King Musa Keita I?
Ruling the Mali Empire in the 14th century CE, Mansa Musa, or the King of Kings, amassed a fortune that possibly made him one of the wealthiest people who ever lived.
But his vast wealth was only one piece of his rich legacy.
When Mansa Musa came to power in 1312, much of Europe was racked by famine and civil wars.
But many African kingdoms and the Islamic world were flourishing, and Mansa Musa played a great role in bringing the fruits of this flourishing to his own realm.
By strategically annexing the city of Timbuktu, and reestablishing power over the city of Gao, he gained control over important trade routes between the Mediterranean and the West African Coast, continuing a period of expansion, which dramatically increased Mali's size.
The territory of the Mali Empire was rich in natural resources, such as gold and salt.
The world first witnessed the extent of Mansa Musa's wealth in 1324 when he took his pilgrimage to Mecca.
Not one to travel on a budget, he brought a caravan stretching as far as the eye could see.
Accounts of this journey are mostly based on an oral testimony and differing written records, so it's difficult to determine the exact details.
But what most agree on is the extravagant scale of the excursion.
Chroniclers describe an entourage of tens of thousands of soldiers, civilians, and slaves, 500 heralds bearing gold staffs and dressed in fine silks, and many camels and horses bearing an abundance of gold bars.
Stopping in cities such as Cairo, Mansa Musa is said to have spent massive quantities of gold, giving to the poor, buying souvenirs, and even having mosques built along the way.
In fact, his spending may have destabilized the regional economy, causing mass inflation.
This journey reportedly took over a year, and by the time Mansa Musa returned, tales of his amazing wealth had spread to the ports of the Mediterranean.
Mali and its king were elevated to near legendary status, cemented by their inclusion on the 1375 Catalan Atlas.
One of the most important world maps of Medieval Europe, it depicted the King holding a scepter and a gleaming gold nugget.
Mansa Musa had literally put his empire and himself on the map.
But material riches weren't the king's only concern.
As a devout Muslim, he took a particular interest in Timbuktu, already a center of religion and learning prior to its annexation.
Upon returning from his pilgrimage, he had the great Djinguereber Mosque built there with the help of an Andalusian architect.
He also established a major university, further elevating the city's reputation, and attracting scholars and students from all over the Islamic world.
Under Mansa Musa, the Empire became urbanized, with schools and mosques in hundreds of densely populated towns.
The king's rich legacy persisted for generations and to this day, there are mausoleums, libraries and mosques that stand as a testament to this golden age of Mali's history.
There's a common misconception that if you like to meticulously organize your things, keep your hands clean, or plan out your weekend to the last detail, you might have OCD.
In fact, OCD, which stands for obsessive compulsive disorder, is a serious psychiatric condition that is frequently misunderstood by society and mental health professionals alike.
So let's start by debunking some myths.
Myth one: repetitive or ritualistic behaviors are synonymous with OCD.
As its name suggests, obsessive compulsive disorder has two aspects: the intrusive thoughts, images, or impulses, known as obsessions, and the behavioral compulsions people engage in to relieve the anxiety the obsessions cause.
The kinds of actions that people often associate with OCD, like excessive hand washing, or checking things repeatedly, may be examples of obsessive or compulsive tendencies that many of us exhibit from time to time.
But the actual disorder is far more rare and can be quite debilitating.
People affected have little or no control over their obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors, which tend to be time consuming and interfere with work, school or social life to the point of causing significant distress.
This set of diagnostic criteria is what separates people suffering from OCD from those who may just be a bit more meticulous or hygiene obsessed than usual.
Myth two: the main symptom of OCD is excessive hand washing.
Although hand washing is the most common image of OCD in popular culture, obsessions and compulsions can take many different forms.
Obsessions can manifest as fears of contamination and illness, worries about harming others, or preoccupations with numbers, patterns, morality, or sexual identity.
And compulsions can range from excessive cleaning or double checking, to the fastidious arrangement of objects, or walking in predetermined patterns.
Myth three: individuals with OCD don't understand that they are acting irrationally.
Many individuals with OCD actually understand the relationship between their obsessions and compulsions quite well.
Being unable to avoid these thoughts and actions despite being aware of their irrationality is part of the reason why OCD is so distressing.
OCD sufferers report feeling crazy for experiencing anxiety based on irrational thoughts and finding it difficult to control their responses.
So what exactly causes OCD?
The frustrating answer is we don't really know.
However, we have some important clues.
OCD is considered a neurobiological disorder.
In other words, research suggests that OCD sufferers brains are actually hardwired to behave in a certain fashion.
Research has implicated three regions of the brain variously involved in social behavior and complex cognitive planning, voluntary movement, and emotional and motivational responses.
The other piece of the puzzle is that OCD is associated with low levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that communicates between brain structures and helps regulate vital processes, such as mood, aggression, impulse control, sleep, appetite, body temperature and pain.
But are serotonin and activity in these brain regions the sources of OCD or symptoms of an unknown underlying cause of the disorder.
We probably won't know until we have a much more intimate understanding of the brain.
The good news is there are effective treatments for OCD, including medications, which increase serotonin in the brain by limiting its reabsorption by brain cells, behavioral therapy that gradually desensitizes patients to their anxieties, and in some cases, electroconvulsive therapy, or surgery, when OCD doesn't respond to other forms of treatment.
Knowing that your own brain is lying to you while not being able to resist its commands can be agonizing.
But with knowledge and understanding comes the power to seek help, and future research into the brain may finally provide the answers we're looking for.
In 1997, in a game between France and Brazil, a young Brazilian player named Roberto Carlos set up for a 35 meter free kick.
With no direct line to the goal, Carlos decided to attempt the seemingly impossible.
His kick sent the ball flying wide of the players, but just before going out of bounds, it hooked to the left and soared into the goal.
According to Newton's first law of motion, an object will move in the same direction and velocity until a force is applied on it.
When Carlos kicked the ball, he gave it direction and velocity, but what force made the ball swerve and score one of the most magnificent goals in the history of the sport?
The trick was in the spin.
Carlos placed his kick at the lower right corner of the ball, sending it high and to the right, but also rotating around its axis.
The ball started its flight in an apparently direct route, with air flowing on both sides and slowing it down.
On one side, the air moved in the opposite direction to the ball's spin, causing increased pressure, while on the other side, the air moved in the same direction as the spin, creating an area of lower pressure.
That difference made the ball curve towards the lower pressure zone.
This phenomenon is called the Magnus effect.
This type of kick, often referred to as a banana kick, is attempted regularly, and it is one of the elements that makes the beautiful game beautiful.
But curving the ball with the precision needed to both bend around the wall and back into the goal is difficult.
Too high and it soars over the goal.
Too low and it hits the ground before curving.
Too wide and it never reaches the goal.
Not wide enough and the defenders intercept it.
Too slow and it hooks too early, or not at all.
Too fast and it hooks too late.
The same physics make it possible to score another apparently impossible goal, an unassisted corner kick.
The Magnus effect was first documented by Sir Isaac Newton after he noticed it while playing a game of tennis back in 1670.
It also applies to golf balls, frisbees and baseballs.
In every case, the same thing happens.
The ball's spin creates a pressure differential in the surrounding air flow that curves it in the direction of the spin.
And here's a question.
Could you theoretically kick a ball hard enough to make it boomerang all the way around back to you?
Sadly, no.
Even if the ball didn't disintegrate on impact, or hit any obstacles, as the air slowed it, the angle of its deflection would increase, causing it to spiral into smaller and smaller circles until finally stopping.
And just to get that spiral, you'd have to make the ball spin over 15 times faster than Carlos's immortal kick.
So good luck with that.
Imagine an island where 100 people, all perfect logicians, are imprisoned by a mad dictator.
There's no escape, except for one strange rule.
Any prisoner can approach the guards at night and ask to leave.
If they have green eyes, they'll be released.
If not, they'll be tossed into the volcano.
As it happens, all 100 prisoners have green eyes, but they've lived there since birth, and the dictator has ensured they can't learn their own eye color.
There are no reflective surfaces, all water is in opaque containers, and most importantly, they're not allowed to communicate among themselves.
Though they do see each other during each morning's head count.
Nevertheless, they all know no one would ever risk trying to leave without absolute certainty of success.
After much pressure from human rights groups, the dictator reluctantly agrees to let you visit the island and speak to the prisoners under the following conditions: you may only make one statement, and you cannot tell them any new information.
What can you say to help free the prisoners without incurring the dictator's wrath?
After thinking long and hard, you tell the crowd, "At least one of you has green eyes."
The dictator is suspicious but reassures himself that your statement couldn't have changed anything.
You leave, and life on the island seems to go on as before.
But on the hundredth morning after your visit, all the prisoners are gone, each having asked to leave the previous night.
So how did you outsmart the dictator?
It might help to realize that the amount of prisoners is arbitrary.
Let's simplify things by imagining just two, Adria and Bill.
Each sees one person with green eyes, and for all they know, that could be the only one.
For the first night, each stays put.
But when they see each other still there in the morning, they gain new information.
Adria realizes that if Bill had seen a non-green-eyed person next to him, he would have left the first night after concluding the statement could only refer to himself.
Bill simultaneously realizes the same thing about Adria.
The fact that the other person waited tells each prisoner his or her own eyes must be green.
And on the second morning, they're both gone.
Now imagine a third prisoner.
Adria, Bill and Carl each see two green-eyed people, but aren't sure if each of the others is also seeing two green-eyed people, or just one.
They wait out the first night as before, but the next morning, they still can't be sure.
Carl thinks, "If I have non-green eyes, Adria and Bill were just watching each other, and will now both leave on the second night."
But when he sees both of them the third morning, he realizes they must have been watching him, too.
Adria and Bill have each been going through the same process, and they all leave on the third night.
Using this sort of inductive reasoning, we can see that the pattern will repeat no matter how many prisoners you add.
The key is the concept of common knowledge, coined by philosopher David Lewis.
The new information was not contained in your statement itself, but in telling it to everyone simultaneously.
Now, besides knowing at least one of them has green eyes, each prisoner also knows that everyone else is keeping track of all the green-eyed people they can see, and that each of them also knows this, and so on.
What any given prisoner doesn't know is whether they themselves are one of the green-eyed people the others are keeping track of until as many nights have passed as the number of prisoners on the island.
Of course, you could have spared the prisoners 98 days on the island by telling them at least 99 of you have green eyes, but when mad dictators are involved, you're best off with a good headstart.
It may seem like the semicolon is struggling with an identity crisis.
It looks like a comma crossed with a period.
Maybe that's why we toss these punctuation marks around like grammatical confetti.
We're confused about how to use them properly.
In fact, it's the semicolon's half-half status that makes it useful.
It's stronger than a comma, and less final than a period.
It fills the spaces in between, and for that reason, it has some specific and important tasks.
For one, it can clarify ideas in a sentence that's already festooned with commas.
"Semicolons: At first, they may seem frightening, then, they become enlightening, finally, you'll find yourself falling for these delightful punctuation marks."
Even though the commas separate different parts of the sentence, it's easy to lose track of what belongs where.
But then the semicolon edges in to the rescue.
In list-like sentences, it can exert more force than commas do, cutting sentences into compartments and grouping items that belong together.
The semicolon breaks things up, but it also builds connections.
Another of its tasks is to link together independent clauses.
These are sentences that can stand on their own, but when connected by semicolons, look and sound better because they're related in some way.
"Semicolons were once a great mystery to me.
I had no idea where to put them."
Technically, there's nothing wrong with that.
These two sentences can stand alone.
But imagine they appeared in a long list of other sentences, all of the same length, each separated by periods.
Things would get monotonous very fast.
In that situation, semicolons bring fluidity and variation to writing by connecting related clauses.
But as beneficial as they are, semicolons don't belong just anywhere.
There are two main rules that govern their use.
Firstly, unless they're being used in lists, semicolons should only connect clauses that are related in some way.
You wouldn't use one here, for instance: "Semicolons were once a great mystery to me; I'd really like a sandwich."
Periods work best here because these are two totally different ideas.
A semicolon's job is to reunite two independent clauses that will benefit from one another's company because they refer to the same thing.
Secondly, you'll almost never find a semicolon willingly stationed before coordinating conjunctions: the words, "and," "but," "for," "nor," "or," "so," and "yet."
That's a comma's place, in fact.
But a semicolon can replace a conjunction to shorten a sentence or to give it some variety.
Ultimately, this underappreciated punctuation mark can give writing clarity, force, and style, all encompassed in one tiny dot and squiggle that's just waiting to be put in the right place.
Our ability to create and sustain economic growth is the defining challenge of our time.
Of course there are other challenges -- health care, disease burdens and pandemics, environmental challenges and, of course, radicalized terrorism.
However, to the extent that we can actually solve the economic growth challenge, it will take us a long way to solving the challenges that I've just elucidated.
More importantly, unless and until we solve economic growth and create sustainable, long-term economic growth, we'll be unable to address the seemingly intractable challenges that continue to pervade the globe today, whether it's health care, education or economic development.
The fundamental question is this: How are we going to create economic growth in advanced and developed economies like the United States and across Europe at a time when they continue to struggle to create economic growth after the financial crisis?
They continue to underperform and to see an erosion in the three key drivers of economic growth: capital, labor and productivity.
In particular, these developed economies continue to see debts and deficits, the decline and erosion of both the quality and quantity of labor and they also see productivity stalling.
In a similar vein, how are we going to create economic growth in the emerging markets, where 90 percent of the world's population lives and where, on average, 70 percent of the population is under the age of 25?
In these countries, it is essential that they grow at a minimum of seven percent a year in order to put a dent in poverty and to double per capita incomes in one generation.
And yet today, the largest emerging economies -- countries with at least 50 million people -- continue to struggle to reach that seven percent magic mark.
Worse than that, countries like India, Russia, South Africa, Brazil and even China are falling below that seven percent number and, in many cases, actually regressing.
Economic growth matters.
With economic growth, countries and societies enter into a virtuous cycle of upward mobility, opportunity and improved living standards.
Without growth, countries contract and atrophy, not just in the annals of economic statistics but also in the meaning of life and how lives are lived.
Economic growth matters powerfully for the individual.
If growth wanes, the risk to human progress and the risk of political and social instability rises, and societies become dimmer, coarser and smaller.
The context matters.
And countries in emerging markets do not need to grow at the same rates as developed countries.
Now, I know some of you in this room find this to be a risky proposition.
There are some people here who will turn around and be quite disillusioned by what's happened around the world and basically ascribe that to economic growth.
You worry about the overpopulation of the planet.
And looking at the UN's recent statistics and projections that the world will have 11 billion people on the planet before it plateaus in 2100, you're concerned about what that does to natural resources -- arable land, potable water, energy and minerals.
You are also concerned about the degradation of the environment.
And you worry about how man, embodied in the corporate globalist, has become greedy and corrupt.
But I'm here to tell you today that economic growth has been the backbone of changes in living standards of millions of people around the world.
And more importantly, it's not just economic growth that has been driven by capitalism.
The definition of capitalism, very simply put, is that the factors of production, such as trade and industry, capital and labor, are left in the hands of the private sector and not the state.
It's really essential here that we understand that fundamentally the critique is not for economic growth per se but what has happened to capitalism.
And to the extent that we need to create economic growth over the long term, we're going to have to pursue it with a better form of economic stance.
Economic growth needs capitalism, but it needs it to work properly.
And as I mentioned a moment ago, the core of the capitalist system has been defined by private actors.
And even this, however, is a very simplistic dichotomy.
Capitalism: good; non-capitalism: bad.
When in practical experience, capitalism is much more of a spectrum.
And we have countries such as China, which have practiced more state capitalism, and we have countries like the Unites States which are more market capitalist.
Our efforts to critique the capitalist system, however, have tended to focus on countries like China that are in fact not blatantly market capitalism.
However, there is a real reason and real concern for us to now focus our attentions on purer forms of capitalism, particularly those embodied by the United States.
This is really important because this type of capitalism has increasingly been afforded the critique that it is now fostering corruption and, worse still, it's increasing income inequality -- the idea that the few are benefiting at the expense of the many.
The two really critical questions that we need to address is how can we fix capitalism so that it can help create economic growth but at the same time can help to address social ills.
In order to think about that framing, we have to ask ourselves, how does capitalism work today?
Very simplistically, capitalism is set on the basis of an individual utility maximizer -- a selfish individual who goes after what he or she wants.
And only after they've maximized their utility do they then decide it's important to provide support to other social contracts.
Of course, in this system governments do tax, and they use part of their revenues to fund social programs, recognizing that government's role is not just regulation but also to be arbiter of social goods.
But nevertheless, this framework -- this two-stage framework -- is the basis from which we must now start to think about how we can improve the capitalist model.
I would argue that there are two sides to this challenge.
First of all, we can draw on the right-wing policies to see what could be beneficial for us to think about how we can improve capitalism.
In particular, right-leaning policies have tended to focus on things like conditional transfers, where we pay and reward people for doing the things that we actually think can help enhance economic growth.
For example, sending children to school, parents could earn money for that, or getting their children inoculated or immunized, parents could get paid for doing that.
Now, quite apart from the debate on whether or not we should be paying people to do what we think they should do anyway, the fact of the matter is that pay for performance has actually yielded some positive results in places like Mexico, in Brazil and also in pilot programs in New York.
But there are also benefits and significant changes underway on left-leaning policies.
Arguments that government should expand its role and responsibility so that it's not so narrowly defined and that government should be much more of an arbiter of the factors of production have become commonplace with the success of China.
But also we've started to have debates about how the role of the private sector should move away from just being a profit motive and really be more engaged in the delivery of social programs.
Things like the corporate social responsibility programs, albeit small in scale, are moving in that right direction.
Of course, left-leaning policies have also tended to blur the lines between government, NGOs and private sector.
Two very good examples of this are the 19th-century United States, when the infrastructure rollout was really about public-private partnerships.
More recently, of course, the advent of the Internet has also proven to the world that public and private can work together for the betterment of society.
My fundamental message to you is this: We cannot continue to try and solve the world economic growth challenges by being dogmatic and being unnecessarily ideological.
In order to create sustainable, long-term economic growth and solve the challenges and social ills that continue to plague the world today, we're going to have to be more broad-minded about what might work.
Ultimately, we have to recognize that ideology is the enemy of growth.
Thank you.
(Applause) Bruno Giussani: I want to ask a couple of questions, Dambisa, because one could react to your last sentence by saying growth is also an ideology, it's possibly the dominant ideology of our times.
What do you say to those who react that way?
DM: Well, I think that that's completely legitimate, and I think that we're already having that discussion.
There's a lot of work going on around happiness and other metrics being used for measuring people's success and improvements in living standards.
And so I think that we should be open to what could deliver improvements in people's living standards and continue to reduce poverty around the world.
BG: So you're basically pleading for rehabilitating growth, but the only way for that happen without compromising the capacity of the earth, to take us on a long journey, is for economic growth somehow to decouple from the underlying use of resources.
Do you see that happening?
DM: Well, I think that I'm more optimistic about human ability and ingenuity.
I think if we start to constrain ourselves using the finite, scarce and depleting resources that we know today, we could get quite negative and quite concerned about the way the world is.
However, we've seen the Club of Rome, we've seen previous claims that the world would be running out of resources, and it's not to argue that those things are not valid.
But I think, with ingenuity we could see desalination, I think we could reinvest in energy, so that we can actually get better outcomes.
And so in that sense, I'm much more optimistic about what humans can do.
BG: The thing that strikes me about your proposals for rehabilitating growth and taking a different direction is that you're kind of suggesting to fix capitalism with more capitalism -- with putting a price tag on good behavior as incentive or developing a bigger role for business in social issues.
Is that what you're suggesting?
DM: I'm suggesting we have to be open-minded.
I think it is absolutely the case that traditional models of economic growth are not working the way we would like them to.
And I think it's no accident that today the largest economy in the world, the United States, has democracy, liberal democracy, as it's core political stance and it has free market capitalism -- to the extent that it is free -- free market capitalism as its economic stance.
The second largest economy is China.
It has deprioritized democracy and it has state capitalism, which is a completely different model.
These two countries, completely different political models and completely different economic models, and yet they have the same income inequality number measured as a Gini coefficient.
I think those are the debates we should have, because it's not clear at all what model we should be adopting, and I think there needs to be much more discourse and much more humility about what we know and what we don't know.
BG: One last question. The COP21 is going on in Paris.
If you could send a tweet to all the heads of state and heads of delegations there, what would you say?
DM: Again, I would be very much about being open-minded.
As you're aware, the issues around the environmental concerns have been on the agenda many times now -- in Copenhagen, '72 in Stockholm -- and we keep revisiting these issues partly because there is not a fundamental agreement, in fact there's a schism between what the developed countries believe and want and what emerging market countries want.
Emerging market countries need to continue to create economic growth so that we don't have political uncertainty in the those countries.
Developed countries recognize that they have a real, important responsibility not only just to manage their CO2 emissions and some of the degradation that they're contributing to the world, but also as trendsetters in R&amp;D.
And so they have to come to the table as well.
But in essence, it cannot be a situation where we start ascribing policies to the emerging markets without developed countries themselves also taking quite a swipe at what they're doing both in demand and supply in developed markets.
BG: Dambisa, thank you for coming to TED. DM: Thank you very much.
(Applause)
We hear about calories all the time.
How many calories are in this cookie?
How many are burned by 100 jumping jacks, or long distance running, or fidgeting?
But what is a calorie, really, and how many of them do we actually need?
Calories are a way of keeping track of the body's energy budget.
A healthy balance occurs when we put in about as much energy as we lose.
If we consistently put more energy into our bodies than we burn, the excess will gradually be stored as fat in our cells, and we'll gain weight.
If we burn off more energy than we replenish, we'll lose weight.
So we have to be able to measure the energy we consume and use, and we do so with a unit called the calorie.
One calorie, the kind we measure in food, also called a large calorie, is defined as the amount of energy it would take to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius.
Everything we consume has a calorie count, a measure of how much energy the item stores in its chemical bonds.
The average pizza slice has 272 calories, there are about 78 in a piece of bread, and an apple has about 52.
That energy is released during digestion, and stored in other molecules that can be broken down to provide energy when the body needs it.
It's used in three ways: about 10% enables digestion, about 20% fuels physical activity, and the biggest chunk, around 70%, supports the basic functions of our organs and tissues.
That third usage corresponds to your basal metabolic rate, a number of calories you would need to survive if you weren't eating or moving around.
Add in some physical activity and digestion, and you arrive at the official guidelines for how many calories the average person requires each day: 2000 for women and 2500 for men.
Those estimates are based on factors like average weight, physical activity and muscle mass.
So does that mean everyone should shoot for around 2000 calories?
Not necessarily.
If you're doing an energy guzzling activity, like cycling the Tour de France, your body could use up to 9000 calories per day.
Pregnancy requires slightly more calories than usual, and elderly people typically have a slower metabolic rate, energy is burned more gradually, so less is needed.
Here's something else you should know before you start counting calories.
The calorie counts on nutrition labels measure how much energy the food contains, not how much energy you can actually get out of it.
Fibrous foods like celery and whole wheat take more energy to digest, so you'd actually wind up with less energy from a 100 calorie serving of celery than a 100 calorie serving of potato chips.
Not to mention the fact that some foods offer nutrients like protein and vitamins, while others provide far less nutritional value.
Eating too many of those foods could leave you overweight and malnourished.
And even with the exact same food, different people might not get the same number of calories.
Variations in things like enzyme levels, gut bacteria, and even intestine length, means that every individual's ability to extract energy from food is a little different.
So a calorie is a useful energy measure, but to work out exactly how many of them each of us requires we need to factor in things like exercise, food type, and our body's ability to process energy.
Good luck finding all of that on a nutrition label.
When we talk about English, we often think of it as a single language but what do the dialects spoken in dozens of countries around the world have in common with each other, or with the writings of Chaucer?
And how are any of them related to the strange words in Beowulf?
The answer is that like most languages, English has evolved through generations of speakers, undergoing major changes over time.
By undoing these changes, we can trace the language from the present day back to its ancient roots.
While modern English shares many similar words with Latin-derived romance languages, like French and Spanish, most of those words were not originally part of it.
Instead, they started coming into the language with the Norman invasion of England in 1066.
When the French-speaking Normans conquered England and became its ruling class, they brought their speech with them, adding a massive amount of French and Latin vocabulary to the English language previously spoken there.
Today, we call that language Old English.
This is the language of Beowulf.
It probably doesn't look very familiar, but it might be more recognizable if you know some German.
That's because Old English belongs to the Germanic language family, first brought to the British Isles in the 5th and 6th centuries by the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes.
The Germanic dialects they spoke would become known as Anglo-Saxon.
Viking invaders in the 8th to 11th centuries added more borrowings from Old Norse into the mix.
It may be hard to see the roots of modern English underneath all the words borrowed from French, Latin, Old Norse and other languages.
But comparative linguistics can help us by focusing on grammatical structure, patterns of sound changes, and certain core vocabulary.
For example, after the 6th century, German words starting with "p," systematically shifted to a "pf" sound while their Old English counterparts kept the "p" unchanged.
In another split, words that have "sk" sounds in Swedish developed an "sh" sound in English.
There are still some English words with "sk," like "skirt," and "skull," but they're direct borrowings from Old Norse that came after the "sk" to "sh" shift.
These examples show us that just as the various Romance languages descended from Latin, English, Swedish, German, and many other languages descended from their own common ancestor known as Proto-Germanic spoken around 500 B.C.E.
Because this historical language was never written down, we can only reconstruct it by comparing its descendants, which is possible thanks to the consistency of the changes.
We can even use the same process to go back one step further, and trace the origins of Proto-Germanic to a language called Proto-Indo-European, spoken about 6000 years ago on the Pontic steppe in modern day Ukraine and Russia.
This is the reconstructed ancestor of the Indo-European family that includes nearly all languages historically spoken in Europe, as well as large parts of Southern and Western Asia.
And though it requires a bit more work, we can find the same systematic similarities, or correspondences, between related words in different Indo-European branches.
Comparing English with Latin, we see that English has "t" where Latin has "d", and "f" where latin has "p" at the start of words.
Some of English's more distant relatives include Hindi, Persian and the Celtic languages it displaced in what is now Britain.
Proto-Indo-European itself descended from an even more ancient language, but unfortunately, this is as far back as historical and archeological evidence will allow us to go.
Many mysteries remain just out of reach, such as whether there might be a link between Indo-European and other major language families, and the nature of the languages spoken in Europe prior to its arrival.
But the amazing fact remains that nearly 3 billion people around the world, many of whom cannot understand each other, are nevertheless speaking the same words shaped by 6000 years of history.
Has anyone ever told you, "Stand up straight!"
or scolded you for slouching at a family dinner?
Comments like that might be annoying, but they're not wrong.
Your posture, the way you hold your body when you're sitting or standing, is the foundation for every movement your body makes, and can determine how well your body adapts to the stresses on it.
These stresses can be things like carrying weight, or sitting in an awkward position.
And the big one we all experience all day every day: gravity.
If your posture isn't optimal, your muscles have to work harder to keep you upright and balanced.
Some muscles will become tight and inflexbile.
Others will be inhibited.
Over time, these dysfunctional adaptations impair your body's ability to deal with the forces on it.
Poor posture inflicts extra wear and tear on your joints and ligaments, increases the likelihood of accidents, and makes some organs, like your lungs, less efficient.
Researchers have linked poor posture to scoliosis, tension headaches, and back pain, though it isn't the exclusive cause of any of them.
Posture can even influence your emotional state and your sensitivity to pain.
So there are a lot of reasons to aim for good posture.
But it's getting harder these days.
Sitting in an awkward position for a long time can promote poor posture, and so can using computers or mobile devices, which encourage you to look downward.
Many studies suggest that, on average, posture is getting worse.
So what does good posture look like?
When you look at the spine from the front or the back, all 33 vertebrae should appear stacked in a straight line.
From the side, the spine should have three curves: one at your neck, one at your shoulders, and one at the small of your back.
You aren't born with this s-shaped spine.
Babies' spines just have one curve like a "c."
The other curves usually develop by 12-18 months as the muscles strengthen.
These curves help us stay upright and absorb some of the stress from activities like walking and jumping.
If they are aligned properly, when you're standing up, you should be able to draw a straight line from a point just in front of your shoulders, to behind your hip, to the front of your knee, to a few inches in front of your ankle.
This keeps your center of gravity directly over your base of support, which allows you to move efficiently with the least amount of fatigue and muscle strain.
If you're sitting, your neck should be vertical, not tilted forward.
Your shoulders should be relaxed with your arms close to your trunk.
Your knees should be at a right angle with your feet flat on the floor.
But what if your posture isn't that great?
Try redesigning your environment.
Adjust your screen so it's at or slightly below eyelevel.
Make sure all parts of your body, like your elbows and wrists, are supported, using ergonomic aids if you need to.
Try sleeping on your side with your neck supported and with a pillow between your legs.
Wear shoes with low heels and good arch support, and use a headset for phone calls.
It's also not enough to just have good posture.
Keeping your muscles and joints moving is extremely important.
In fact, being stationary for long periods with good posture can be worse than regular movement with bad posture.
When you do move, move smartly.
Keep anything you're carrying close to your body.
Backpacks should be in contact with your back carried symetrically.
If you sit a lot, get up and move around on occassion, and be sure to exercise.
Using your muscles will keep them strong enough to support you effectively, on top of all the other benefits to your joints, bones, brain and heart.
And if you're really worried, check with a physical therapist, because yes, you really should stand up straight.
As a boy in Lima, my grandfather told me a legend of the Spanish conquest of Peru.
Atahualpa, emperor of the Inca, had been captured and killed.
Pizarro and his conquistadors had grown rich, and tales of their conquest and glory had reached Spain and was bringing new waves of Spaniards, hungry for gold and glory.
They would go into towns and ask the Inca, "Where's another civilization we can conquer? Where's more gold?"
And the Inca, out of vengeance, told them, "Go to the Amazon.
You'll find all the gold you want there.
In fact, there is a city called Paititi -- El Dorado in Spanish -- made entirely of gold."
The Spanish set off into the jungle, but the few that return come back with stories, stories of powerful shamans, of warriors with poisoned arrows, of trees so tall they blotted out the sun, spiders that ate birds, snakes that swallowed men whole and a river that boiled.
All this became a childhood memory.
And years passed.
I'm working on my PhD at SMU, trying to understand Peru's geothermal energy potential, when I remember this legend, and I began asking that question.
Could the boiling river exist?
I asked colleagues from universities, the government, oil, gas and mining companies, and the answer was a unanimous no.
And this makes sense.
You see, boiling rivers do exist in the world, but they're generally associated with volcanoes.
You need a powerful heat source to produce such a large geothermal manifestation.
And as you can see from the red dots here, which are volcanoes, we don't have volcanoes in the Amazon, nor in most of Peru.
So it follows: We should not expect to see a boiling river.
Telling this same story at a family dinner, my aunt tells me, "But no, Andrés, I've been there. I've swum in that river."
(Laughter) Then my uncle jumps in.
"No, Andrés, she's not kidding.
You see, you can only swim in it after a very heavy rain, and it's protected by a powerful shaman.
Your aunt, she's friends with his wife."
(Laughter) "¿Cómo?" ["Huh?"] You know, despite all my scientific skepticism, I found myself hiking into the jungle, guided by my aunt, over 700 kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center, and well, honestly, mentally preparing myself to behold the legendary "warm stream of the Amazon."
But then ...
I heard something, a low surge that got louder and louder as we came closer.
It sounded like ocean waves constantly crashing, and as we got closer, I saw smoke, vapor, coming up through the trees.
And then, I saw this.
I immediately grabbed for my thermometer, and the average temperatures in the river were 86 degrees C.
This is not quite the 100-degree C boiling but definitely close enough.
The river flowed hot and fast.
I followed it upriver and was led by, actually, the shaman's apprentice to the most sacred site on the river.
And this is what's bizarre -- It starts off as a cold stream.
And here, at this site, is the home of the Yacumama, mother of the waters, a giant serpent spirit who births hot and cold water.
And here we find a hot spring, mixing with cold stream water underneath her protective motherly jaws and thus bringing their legends to life.
The next morning, I woke up and -- (Laughter) I asked for tea.
I was handed a mug, a tea bag and, well, pointed towards the river.
To my surprise, the water was clean and had a pleasant taste, which is a little weird for geothermal systems.
What was amazing is that the locals had always known about this place, and that I was by no means the first outsider to see it.
It was just part of their everyday life.
They drink its water.
They take in its vapor.
They cook with it, clean with it, even make their medicines with it.
I met the shaman, and he seemed like an extension of the river and his jungle.
He asked for my intentions and listened carefully.
Then, to my tremendous relief -- I was freaking out, to be honest with you -- a smile began to snake across his face, and he just laughed.
(Laughter) I had received the shaman's blessing to study the river, on the condition that after I take the water samples and analyze them in my lab, wherever I was in the world, that I pour the waters back into the ground so that, as the shaman said, the waters could find their way back home.
I've been back every year since that first visit in 2011, and the fieldwork has been exhilarating, demanding and at times dangerous.
One story was even featured in National Geographic Magazine.
I was trapped on a small rock about the size of a sheet of paper in sandals and board shorts, in between an 80 degree C river and a hot spring that, well, looked like this, close to boiling.
And on top of that, it was Amazon rain forest.
Pshh, pouring rain, couldn't see a thing.
The temperature differential made it all white. It was a whiteout.
Intense.
Now, after years of work, I'll soon be submitting my geophysical and geochemical studies for publication.
And I'd like to share, today, with all of you here, on the TED stage, for the first time, some of these discoveries.
Well, first off, it's not a legend.
Surprise!
(Laughter) When I first started the research, the satellite imagery was too low-resolution to be meaningful.
There were just no good maps.
Thanks to the support of the Google Earth team, I now have this.
Not only that, the indigenous name of the river, Shanay-timpishka, "boiled with the heat of the sun," indicating that I'm not the first to wonder why the river boils, and showing that humanity has always sought to explain the world around us.
So why does the river boil?
(Bubbling sounds) It actually took me three years to get that footage.
Fault-fed hot springs.
As we have hot blood running through our veins and arteries, so, too, the earth has hot water running through its cracks and faults.
Where these arteries come to the surface, these earth arteries, we'll get geothermal manifestations: fumaroles, hot springs and in our case, the boiling river.
What's truly incredible, though, is the scale of this place.
Next time you cross the road, think about this.
The river flows wider than a two-lane road along most of its path.
It flows hot for 6.24 kilometers.
Truly impressive.
There are thermal pools larger than this TED stage, and that waterfall that you see there is six meters tall -- and all with near-boiling water.
We mapped the temperatures along the river, and this was by far the most demanding part of the fieldwork.
And the results were just awesome.
Sorry -- the geoscientist in me coming out.
And it showed this amazing trend.
You see, the river starts off cold.
It then heats up, cools back down, heats up, cools back down, heats up again, and then has this beautiful decay curve until it smashes into this cold river.
Now, I understand not all of you are geothermal scientists, so to put it in more everyday terms: Everyone loves coffee.
Yes? Good.
Your regular cup of coffee, 54 degrees C, an extra-hot one, well, 60.
So, put in coffee shop terms, the boiling river plots like this.
There you have your hot coffee.
Here you have your extra-hot coffee, and you can see that there's a bit point there where the river is still hotter than even the extra-hot coffee.
And these are average water temperatures.
We took these in the dry season to ensure the purest geothermal temperatures.
But there's a magic number here that's not being shown, and that number is 47 degrees C, because that's where things start to hurt, and I know this from very personal experience.
Above that temperature, you don't want to get in that water.
You need to be careful.
It can be deadly.
I've seen all sorts of animals fall in, and what's shocking to me, is the process is pretty much the same.
So they fall in and the first thing to go are the eyes.
Eyes, apparently, cook very quickly. They turn this milky-white color.
The stream is carrying them.
They're trying to swim out, but their meat is cooking on the bone because it's so hot.
So they're losing power, losing power, until finally they get to a point where hot water goes into their mouths and they cook from the inside out.
(Laughter) A bit sadistic, aren't we?
Jeez.
Leave them marinating for a little longer.
What's, again, amazing are these temperatures.
They're similar to things that I've seen on volcanoes all over the world and even super-volcanoes like Yellowstone.
But here's the thing: the data is showing that the boiling river exists independent of volcanism.
It's neither magmatic or volcanic in origin, and again, over 700 kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center.
How can a boiling river exist like this?
I've asked geothermal experts and volcanologists for years, and I'm still unable to find another non-volcanic geothermal system of this magnitude.
It's unique.
It's special on a global scale.
So, still -- how does it work?
Where do we get this heat?
There's still more research to be done to better constrain the problem and better understand the system, but from what the data is telling us now, it looks to be the result of a large hydrothermal system.
Basically, it works like this: So, the deeper you go into the earth, the hotter it gets.
We refer to this as the geothermal gradient.
The waters could be coming from as far away as glaciers in the Andes, then seeping down deep into the earth and coming out to form the boiling river after getting heated up from the geothermal gradient, all due to this unique geologic setting.
Now, we found that in and around the river -- this is working with colleagues from National Geographic, Dr. Spencer Wells, and Dr. Jon Eisen from UC Davis -- we genetically sequenced the extremophile lifeforms living in and around the river, and have found new lifeforms, unique species living in the boiling river.
But again, despite all of these studies, all of these discoveries and the legends, a question remains: What is the significance of the boiling river?
What is the significance of this stationary cloud that always hovers over this patch of jungle?
And what is the significance of a detail in a childhood legend?
To the shaman and his community, it's a sacred site.
To me, as a geoscientist, it's a unique geothermal phenomenon.
But to the illegal loggers and cattle farmers, it's just another resource to exploit.
And to the Peruvian government, it's just another stretch of unprotected land ready for development.
My goal is to ensure that whoever controls this land understands the boiling river's uniqueness and significance.
Because that's the question, one of significance.
And the thing there is, we define significance.
It's us. We have that power.
We are the ones who draw that line between the sacred and the trivial.
And in this age, where everything seems mapped, measured and studied, in this age of information, I remind you all that discoveries are not just made in the black void of the unknown but in the white noise of overwhelming data.
There remains so much to explore.
We live in an incredible world.
So go out.
Be curious.
Because we do live in a world where shamans still sing to the spirits of the jungle, where rivers do boil and where legends do come to life.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Throughout the history of mankind, three little words have sent poets to the blank page, philosophers to the Agora, and seekers to the oracles: "Who am I?"
From the ancient Greek aphorism inscribed on the Temple of Apollo, "Know thyself," to The Who's rock anthem, "Who Are You?"
philosophers, psychologists, academics, scientists, artists, theologians and politicians have all tackled the subject of identity.
Their hypotheses are widely varied and lack significant consensus.
These are smart, creative people, so what's so hard about coming up with the right answer?
One challenge certainly lies with the complex concept of the persistence of identity.
Which you is who?
The person you are today?
Five years ago?
Who you'll be in 50 years?
And when is "am"?
This week?
Today?
This hour?
This second?
And which aspect of you is "I"?
Are you your physical body?
Your thoughts and feelings?
Your actions?
These murky waters of abstract logic are tricky to navigate, and so it's probably fitting that to demonstrate the complexity, the Greek historian Plutarch used the story of a ship.
How are you "I"?
As the tale goes, Theseus, the mythical founder King of Athens, single-handedly slayed the evil Minotaur at Crete, then returned home on a ship.
To honor this heroic feat, for 1000 years Athenians painstakingly maintained his ship in the harbor, and annually reenacted his voyage.
Whenever a part of the ship was worn or damaged, it was replaced with an identical piece of the same material until, at some point, no original parts remained.
Plutarch noted the Ship of Theseus was an example of the philosophical paradox revolving around the persistence of identity.
How can every single part of something be replaced, yet it still remains the same thing?
Let's imagine there are two ships: the ship that Theseus docked in Athens, Ship A, and the ship sailed by the Athenians 1000 years later, Ship B.
Very simply, our question is this: does A equal B?
Some would say that for 1000 years there has been only one Ship of Theseus, and because the changes made to it happened gradually, it never at any point in time stopped being the legendary ship.
Though they have absolutely no parts in common, the two ships are numerically identical, meaning one and the same, so A equals B.
However, others could argue that Theseus never set foot on Ship B, and his presence on the ship is an essential qualitative property of the Ship of Theseus.
It cannot survive without him.
So, though the two ships are numerically identical, they are not qualitatively identical.
Thus, A does not equal B.
But what happens when we consider this twist?
What if, as each piece of the original ship was cast off, somebody collected them all, and rebuilt the entire original ship?
When it was finished, undeniably two physical ships would exist: the one that's docked in Athens, and the one in some guy's backyard.
Each could lay claim to the title, "The Ship of Theseus," but only would could actually be the real thing.
So which one is it, and more importantly, what does this have to do with you?
Like the Ship of Theseus, you are a collection of constantly changing parts: your physical body, mind, emotions, circumstances, and even your quirks, always changing, but still in an amazing and sometimes illogical way, you stay the same, too.
This is one of the reasons that the question, "Who am I?" is so complex.
And in order to answer it, like so many great minds before you, you must be willing to dive into the bottomless ocean of philosophical paradox.
Or maybe you could just answer, "I am a legendary hero sailing a powerful ship on an epic journey."
That could work, too.
What do Charles Darwin, Michael Jordan, and Yoda have in common?
They, like many other historical and fictive individuals, are bald, in some cases by their own choice.
For centuries, a shining dome has been a symbol of intelligence, but despite this, many balding people still wish their hair would return.
Scientists have long pondered, "Why do some people lose their hair, and how can we bring it back?"
The full-headed among us have about 100,000 to 150,000 hairs on our scalps, and scientists have discovered two things about this dense thicket.
Firstly, the sprouting hair we see is mostly made up of keratin, the protein leftover from dead cells that are forced upwards as new cells grow beneath them.
Secondly, the structures that drive hair growth are called hair follicles, a network of complex organs that forms before we're born, and grows hair in an everlasting cycle.
This cycle has three main phases.
The first is anagen, the growth phase, which up to 90% of your hair follicles are experiencing right now, causing them to push up hair at a rate of one centimeter per month.
Anagen can last for two to seven years, depending on your genes.
After this productive period, signals within the skin instruct some follicles to enter a new phase known as catagen, or the regressing stage, causing hair follicles to shrink to a fraction of their original length.
Catagen lasts for about two to three weeks and cuts blood supply to the follicle, creating a club hair, meaning it's ready to be shed.
Finally, hairs enter telogen, the resting phase, which lasts for ten to twelve weeks, and affects about 5-15% of your scalp follicles.
During telogen, up to 200 club hairs can be shed in a day, which is quite normal.
Then, the growth cycle begins anew.
But not all heads are hairy, and, in fact, some of them grow increasingly patchy over time in response to bodily changes.
95% of baldness in men can be attributed to male pattern baldness.
Baldness is inherited, and in people with this condition, follicles become incredibly sensitive to the effects of dihydrotestosterone, a hormonal product made from testosterone.
DHT causes shrinkage in these overly sensitive follicles, making hair shorter and wispier.
But loss isn't sudden.
It happens gradually, along a metric known as the Norwood Scale, which describes the severity of hair loss.
First, hair recedes along the temples, then hair on the crown begins to thin in a circular pattern.
At the highest rating on the scale, these balding areas meet and expand dramatically, eventually leaving only a ring of sparse hair around the temples and the back of the head.
Genetics isn't all that drives hair loss.
Long periods of stress can release signals that shock follicles and force them into the resting phase prematurely.
Some women experience this after childbirth.
Follicles might also lose the ability to go into anagen, the growth phase.
People going through chemotherapy treatment temporarily experience this.
But while balding may look permanent, scientific investigation has revealed the opposite.
Below the skin's surface, the roots that give rise to our hair actually remain alive.
Using this knowledge, scientists have developed drugs that shorten the resting phase, and force follicles into anagen.
Other drugs combat male pattern baldness by blocking the conversion of testosterone to DHT so that it doesn't affect those sensitive follicles.
Stem cells also play a role in regulating the growth cycle, and so scientists are investigating whether they can manipulate the activity of these cells to encourage follicles to start producing hair again.
And in the meantime, while scientists hone their hair-reviving methods, anyone going bald, or considering baldness, can remember that they're in great company.
Taking that internship in a remote mountain lab might not have been the best idea.
Pulling that lever with the skull symbol just to see what it did probably wasn't so smart, either, but now is not the time for regrets because you need to get away from these mutant zombies fast.
With you are the janitor, the lab assistant, and the old professor.
You've gotten a headstart, but there's only one way to safety: across an old rope bridge spanning a massive gorge.
You can dash across in a minute, while the lab assistant takes two minutes.
The janitor is a bit slower and needs five minutes, and the professor takes a whole ten minutes, holding onto the ropes every step of the way.
By the professor's calculations, the zombies will catch up to you in just over 17 minutes, so you only have that much time to get everyone across and cut the ropes.
Unfortunately, the bridge can only hold two people at a time.
To make matters worse, it's so dark out that you can barely see, and the old lantern you grabbed on your way only illuminates a tiny area.
Can you figure out a way to have everyone escape in time?
Remember: no more than two people can cross the bridge together, anyone crossing must either hold the lantern or stay right next to it, and any of you can safely wait in the dark on either side of the gorge.
Most importantly, everyone must be safely across before the zombies arrive.
Otherwise, the first zombie could step on the bridge while people are still on it.
Finally, there are no tricks to use here.
You can't swing across, use the bridge as a raft, or befriend the zombies.
Pause the video now if you want to figure it out for yourself!
Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 At first it might seem like no matter what you do, you're just a minute or two short of time, but there is a way.
The key is to minimize the time wasted by the two slowest people by having them cross together.
And because you'll need to make a couple of return trips with the lantern, you'll want to have the fastest people available to do so.
So, you and the lab assistant quickly run across with the lantern, though you have to slow down a bit to match her pace.
After two minutes, both of you are across, and you, as the quickest, run back with the lantern.
Only three minutes have passed.
So far, so good.
Now comes the hard part.
The professor and the janitor take the lantern and cross together.
This takes them ten minutes since the janitor has to slow down for the old professor who keeps muttering that he probably shouldn't have given the zombies night vision.
By the time they're across, there are only four minutes left, and you're still stuck on the wrong side of the bridge.
But remember, the lab assistant has been waiting on the other side, and she's the second fastest of the group.
So she grabs the lantern from the professor and runs back across to you.
Now with only two minutes left, the two of you make the final crossing.
As you step on the far side of the gorge, you cut the ropes and collapse the bridge behind you, just in the nick of time.
Maybe next summer, you'll just stick to the library.
You may never have heard of Kenema, Sierra Leone or Arua, Nigeria.
But I know them as two of the most extraordinary places on earth.
In hospitals there, there's a community of nurses, physicians and scientists that have been quietly battling one of the deadliest threats to humanity for years: Lassa virus.
Lassa virus is a lot like Ebola.
It can cause a severe fever and can often be fatal.
But these individuals, they risk their lives every day to protect the individuals in their communities, and by doing so, protect us all.
But one of the most extraordinary things I learned about them on one of my first visits out there many years ago was that they start each morning -- these challenging, extraordinary days on the front lines -- by singing.
They gather together, and they show their joy.
They show their spirit.
And over the years, from year after year as I've visited them and they've visited me, I get to gather with them and I sing and we write and we love it, because it reminds us that we're not just there to pursue science together; we're bonded through a shared humanity.
And that of course, as you can imagine, becomes extremely important, even essential, as things begin to change.
And that changed a great deal in March of 2014, when the Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea.
This is the first outbreak in West Africa, near the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
And it was frightening, frightening for us all.
We had actually suspected for some time that Lassa and Ebola were more widespread than thought, and we thought it could one day come to Kenema.
And so members of my team immediately went out and joined Dr. Humarr Khan and his team there, and we set up diagnostics to be able to have sensitive molecular tests to pick up Ebola if it came across the border and into Sierra Leone.
We'd already set up this kind of capacity for Lassa virus, we knew how to do it, the team is outstanding.
We just had to give them the tools and place to survey for Ebola.
And unfortunately, that day came.
On May 23, 2014, a woman checked into the maternity ward at the hospital, and the team ran those important molecular tests and they identified the first confirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
This was an exceptional work that was done.
They were able to diagnose the case immediately, to safely treat the patient and to begin to do contact tracing to follow what was going on.
It could've stopped something.
But by the time that day came, the outbreak had already been breeding for months.
With hundreds of cases, it had already eclipsed all previous outbreaks.
And it came into Sierra Leone not as that singular case, but as a tidal wave.
We had to work with the international community, with the Ministry of Health, with Kenema, to begin to deal with the cases, as the next week brought 31, then 92, then 147 cases -- all coming to Kenema, one of the only places in Sierra Leone that could deal with this.
And we worked around the clock trying to do everything we could, trying to help the individuals, trying to get attention, but we also did one other simple thing.
From that specimen that we take from a patient's blood to detect Ebola, we can discard it, obviously.
The other thing we can do is, actually, put in a chemical and deactivate it, so just place it into a box and ship it across the ocean, and that's what we did.
We sent it to Boston, where my team works.
And we also worked around the clock doing shift work, day after day, and we quickly generated 99 genomes of the Ebola virus.
This is the blueprint -- the genome of a virus is the blueprint.
We all have one.
It says everything that makes up us, and it tells us so much information.
The results of this kind of work are simple and they're powerful.
We could actually take these 99 different viruses, look at them and compare them, and we could see, actually, compared to three genomes that had been previously published from Guinea, we could show that the outbreak emerged in Guinea months before, once into the human population, and from there had been transmitting from human to human.
Now, that's incredibly important when you're trying to figure out how to intervene, but the important thing is contact tracing.
We also could see that as the virus was moving between humans, it was mutating.
And each of those mutations are so important, because the diagnostics, the vaccines, the therapies that we're using, are all based on that genome sequence, fundamentally -- that's what drives it.
And so global health experts would need to respond, would have to develop, to recalibrate everything that they were doing.
But the way that science works, the position I was in at that point is, I had the data, and I could have worked in a silo for many, many months, analyzed the data carefully, slowly, submitted the paper for publication, gone through a few back-and-forths, and then finally when the paper came out, might release that data.
That's the way the status quo works.
Well, that was not going to work at this point, right?
We had friends on the front lines and to us it was just obvious that what we needed is help, lots of help.
So the first thing we did is, as soon as the sequences came off the machines, we published it to the web.
We just released it to the whole world and said, "Help us."
And help came.
Before we knew it, we were being contacted from people all over, surprised to see the data out there and released.
Some of the greatest viral trackers in the world were suddenly part of our community.
We were working together in this virtual way, sharing, regular calls, communications, trying to follow the virus minute by minute, to see ways that we could stop it.
And there are so many ways that we can form communities like that.
Everybody, particularly when the outbreak started to expand globally, was reaching out to learn, to participate, to engage.
Everybody wants to play a part.
The amount of human capacity out there is just amazing, and the Internet connects us all.
And could you imagine that instead of being frightened of each other, that we all just said, "Let's do this.
Let's work together, and let's make this happen."
But the problem is that the data that all of us are using, Googling on the web, is just too limited to do what we need to do.
And so many opportunities get missed when that happens.
So in the early part of the epidemic from Kenema, we'd had 106 clinical records from patients, and we once again made that publicly available to the world.
And in our own lab, we could show that you could take those 106 records, we could train computers to predict the prognosis for Ebola patients to near 100 percent accuracy.
And we made an app that could release that, to make that available to health-care workers in the field.
But 106 is just not enough to make it powerful, to validate it.
So we were waiting for more data to release that.
and the data has still not come.
We are still waiting, tweaking away, in silos rather than working together.
And this just -- we can't accept that.
Right? You, all of you, cannot accept that.
It's our lives on the line.
And in fact, actually, many lives were lost, many health-care workers, including beloved colleagues of mine, five colleagues: Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi, Dr. Humarr Khan, Alice Kovoma and Mohamed Fullah.
These are just five of many health-care workers at Kenema and beyond that died while the world waited and while we all worked, quietly and separately.
See, Ebola, like all threats to humanity, it's fueled by mistrust and distraction and division.
When we build barriers amongst ourselves and we fight amongst ourselves, the virus thrives.
But unlike all threats to humanity, Ebola is one where we're actually all the same.
We're all in this fight together.
Ebola on one person's doorstep could soon be on ours.
And so in this place with the same vulnerabilities, the same strengths, the same fears, the same hopes, I hope that we work together with joy.
A graduate student of mine was reading a book about Sierra Leone, and she discovered that the word "Kenema," the hospital that we work at and the city where we work in Sierra Leone, is named after the Mende word for "clear like a river, translucent and open to the public gaze."
That was really profound for us, because without knowing it, we'd always felt that in order to honor the individuals in Kenema where we worked, we had to work openly, we had to share and we had to work together.
And we have to do that.
We all have to demand that of ourselves and others -- to be open to each other when an outbreak happens, to fight in this fight together.
Because this is not the first outbreak of Ebola, it will not be the last, and there are many other microbes out there that are lying in wait, like Lassa virus and others.
And the next time this happens, it could happen in a city of millions, it could start there.
It could be something that's transmitted through the air.
It could even be disseminated intentionally.
And I know that that is frightening, I understand that, but I know also, and this experience shows us, that we have the technology and we have the capacity to win this thing, to win this and have the upper hand over viruses.
But we can only do it if we do it together and we do it with joy.
So for Dr. Khan and for all of those who sacrificed their lives on the front lines in this fight with us always, let us be in this fight with them always.
And let us not let the world be defined by the destruction wrought by one virus, but illuminated by billions of hearts and minds working in unity.
Thank you.
(Applause)
This may look like a neatly arranged stack of numbers, but it's actually a mathematical treasure trove.
Indian mathematicians called it the Staircase of Mount Meru.
In Iran, it's the Khayyam Triangle.
And in China, it's Yang Hui's Triangle.
To much of the Western world, it's known as Pascal's Triangle after French mathematician Blaise Pascal, which seems a bit unfair since he was clearly late to the party, but he still had a lot to contribute.
So what is it about this that has so intrigued mathematicians the world over?
In short, it's full of patterns and secrets.
First and foremost, there's the pattern that generates it.
Start with one and imagine invisible zeros on either side of it.
Add them together in pairs, and you'll generate the next row.
Now, do that again and again.
Keep going and you'll wind up with something like this, though really Pascal's Triangle goes on infinitely.
Now, each row corresponds to what's called the coefficients of a binomial expansion of the form (x+y)^n, where n is the number of the row, and we start counting from zero.
So if you make n=2 and expand it, you get (x^2) + 2xy + (y^2).
The coefficients, or numbers in front of the variables, are the same as the numbers in that row of Pascal's Triangle.
You'll see the same thing with n=3, which expands to this.
So the triangle is a quick and easy way to look up all of these coefficients.
But there's much more.
For example, add up the numbers in each row, and you'll get successive powers of two.
Or in a given row, treat each number as part of a decimal expansion.
In other words, row two is (1x1) + (2x10) + (1x100).
You get 121, which is 11^2.
And take a look at what happens when you do the same thing to row six.
It adds up to 1,771,561, which is 11^6, and so on.
There are also geometric applications.
Look at the diagonals.
The first two aren't very interesting: all ones, and then the positive integers, also known as natural numbers.
But the numbers in the next diagonal are called the triangular numbers because if you take that many dots, you can stack them into equilateral triangles.
The next diagonal has the tetrahedral numbers because similarly, you can stack that many spheres into tetrahedra.
Or how about this: shade in all of the odd numbers.
It doesn't look like much when the triangle's small, but if you add thousands of rows, you get a fractal known as Sierpinski's Triangle.
This triangle isn't just a mathematical work of art.
It's also quite useful, especially when it comes to probability and calculations in the domain of combinatorics.
Say you want to have five children, and would like to know the probability of having your dream family of three girls and two boys.
In the binomial expansion, that corresponds to girl plus boy to the fifth power.
So we look at the row five, where the first number corresponds to five girls, and the last corresponds to five boys.
The third number is what we're looking for.
Ten out of the sum of all the possibilities in the row.
so 10/32, or 31.25%.
Or, if you're randomly picking a five-player basketball team out of a group of twelve friends, how many possible groups of five are there?
In combinatoric terms, this problem would be phrased as twelve choose five, and could be calculated with this formula, or you could just look at the sixth element of row twelve on the triangle and get your answer.
The patterns in Pascal's Triangle are a testament to the elegantly interwoven fabric of mathematics.
And it's still revealing fresh secrets to this day.
For example, mathematicians recently discovered a way to expand it to these kinds of polynomials.
What might we find next?
Well, that's up to you.
A 13,000 mile dragon of earth and stone winds its way through the countryside of China with a history almost as long and serpentine as the structure.
The Great Wall began as multiple walls of rammed earth built by individual feudal states during the Chunqiu period to protect against nomadic raiders north of China and each other.
When Emperor Qin Shi Huang unified the states in 221 BCE, the Tibetan Plateau and Pacific Ocean became natural barriers, but the mountains in the north remained vulnerable to Mongol, Turkish, and Xiongnu invasions.
To defend against them, the Emperor expanded the small walls built by his predecessors, connecting some and fortifying others.
As the structures grew from Lintao in the west to Liaodong in the east, they collectively became known as The Long Wall.
To accomplish this task, the Emperor enlisted soldiers and commoners, not always voluntarily.
Of the hundreds of thousands of builders recorded during the Qin Dynasty, many were forcibly conscripted peasants and others were criminals serving out sentences.
Under the Han Dynasty, the wall grew longer still, reaching 3700 miles, and spanning from Dunhuang to the Bohai Sea.
Forced labor continued under the Han Emperor Han-Wudi , and the walls reputation grew into a notorious place of suffering.
Poems and legends of the time told of laborers buried in nearby mass graves, or even within the wall itself.
And while no human remains have been found inside, grave pits do indicate that many workers died from accidents, hunger and exhaustion.
The wall was formidable but not invincible.
Both Genghis and his son Khublai Khan managed to surmount the wall during the Mongol invasion of the 13th Century.
After the Ming dynasty gained control in 1368, they began to refortify and further consolidate the wall using bricks and stones from local kilns.
Averaging 23 feet high and 21 feet wide, the walls 5500 miles were punctuated by watchtowers.
When raiders were sighted, fire and smoke signals traveled between towers until reinforcements arrived.
Small openings along the wall let archers fire on invaders, while larger ones were used to drop stones and more.
But even this new and improved wall was not enough.
In 1644, northern Manchu clans overthrew the Ming to establish the Qing dynasty, incorporating Mongolia as well, Thus, for the second time, China was ruled by the very people the wall had tried to keep out.
With the empire's borders now extending beyond the Great Wall, the fortifications lost their purpose.
And without regular reinforcement, the wall fell into disrepair, rammed earth eroded, while brick and stone were plundered for building materials.
But its job wasn't finished.
During World War II, China used sections for defense against Japanese invasion, and some parts are still rumored to be used for military training.
But the Wall's main purpose today is cultural.
As one of the largest man-made structures on Earth, it was granted UNESCO World Heritage Status in 1987.
Originally built to keep people out of China, the Great Wall now welcomes millions of visitors each year.
In fact, the influx of tourists has caused the wall to deteriorate, leading the Chinese government to launch preservation initiatives.
It's also often acclaimed as the only man-made structure visible from space.
Unfortunately, that's not at all true.
In low Earth orbit, all sorts of structures, like bridges, highways and airports are visible, and the Great Wall is only barely discernible.
From the moon, it doesn't stand a chance.
But regardless, it's the Earth we should be studying it from because new sections are still discovered every few years, branching off from the main body and expanding this remarkable monument to human achievement.
Think back to a really vivid memory.
Got it?
Okay, now try to remember what you had for lunch three weeks ago.
That second memory probably isn't as strong, but why not?
Why do we remember some things, and not others?
And why do memories eventually fade?
Let's look at how memories form in the first place.
When you experience something, like dialing a phone number, the experience is converted into a pulse of electrical energy that zips along a network of neurons.
Information first lands in short term memory, where it's available from anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes.
It's then transferred to long-term memory through areas such as the hippocampus, and finally to several storage regions across the brain.
Neurons throughout the brain communicate at dedicated sites called synapses using specialized neurotransmitters.
If two neurons communicate repeatedly, a remarkable thing happens: the efficiency of communication between them increases.
This process, called long term potentiation, is considered to be a mechanism by which memories are stored long-term, but how do some memories get lost?
Age is one factor.
As we get older, synapses begin to falter and weaken, affecting how easily we can retrieve memories.
Scientists have several theories about what's behind this deterioration, from actual brain shrinkage, the hippocampus loses 5% of its neurons every decade for a total loss of 20% by the time you're 80 years old to the drop in the production of neurotransmitters, like acetylcholine, which is vital to learning and memory.
These changes seem to affect how people retrieve stored information.
Age also affects our memory-making abilities.
Memories are encoded most strongly when we're paying attention, when we're deeply engaged, and when information is meaningful to us.
Mental and physical health problems, which tend to increase as we age, interfere with our ability to pay attention, and thus act as memory thieves.
Another leading cause of memory problems is chronic stress.
When we're constantly overloaded with work and personal responsibilites, our bodies are on hyperalert.
This response has evolved from the physiological mechanism designed to make sure we can survive in a crisis.
Stress chemicals help mobilize energy and increase alertness.
However, with chronic stress our bodies become flooded with these chemicals, resulting in a loss of brain cells and an inability to form new ones, which affects our ability to retain new information.
Depression is another culprit.
People who are depressed are 40% more likely to develop memory problems.
Low levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter connected to arousal, may make depressed individuals less attentive to new information.
Dwelling on sad events in the past, another symptom of depression, makes it difficult to pay attention to the present, affecting the ability to store short-term memories.
Isolation, which is tied to depression, is another memory thief.
A study by the Harvard School of Public Health found that older people with high levels of social integration had a slower rate of memory decline over a six-year period.
The exact reason remains unclear, but experts suspect that social interaction gives our brain a mental workout.
Just like muscle strength, we have to use our brain or risk losing it.
But don't despair.
There are several steps you can take to aid your brain in preserving your memories.
Make sure you keep physically active.
Increased blood flow to the brain is helpful.
And eat well.
Your brain needs all the right nutrients to keep functioning correctly.
And finally, give your brain a workout.
Exposing your brain to challenges, like learning a new language, is one of the best defenses for keeping your memories intact.
Hello.
My name is Matthew Williams, and I am a champion.
I have won medals in three different sports and national games in Canada, competed at the international level in basketball and was proud to represent Canada on the world stage.
(Applause) I train five days a week for basketball and speed skating, work with top quality coaches and mental performance consultants to be at my best in my sport.
By the way, all that is through Special Olympics.
Does that change the way you think of me and my accomplishments?
The world does not see all people like me as champions.
Not long ago, people like me were shunned and hidden away.
There has been lots of change since Special Olympics began in 1968, but in too many cases, people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to the wider population.
People use the r-word in front of me, and they think it doesn't matter.
That's the word "retard" or "retarded" used in a derogatory manner.
They're not thinking about how much it hurts me and my friends.
I don't want you to think I'm here because I'm a charity case.
I am here because there is still a big problem with the way many people see individuals with intellectual disabilities, or, too often, how they don't see them at all.
Did you know the World Games happened this year?
I was one of over 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 165 countries who competed in LA.
There was over 62,000 spectators watching opening ceremonies, and there was live coverage on TSN and ESPN.
Did you even know that happened?
What do you think of when you see someone like me?
I am here today to challenge you to look at us as equals.
Special Olympics transforms the self-identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities and the perceptions of everyone watching.
For those of you who aren't familiar, Special Olympics is for athletes with intellectual disabilities.
Special Olympics is separate from the Paralympics and Olympics.
We offer high-quality, year round sports programs for people with intellectual disabilities that changes lives and perceptions.
This movement has changed my life and those of so many others.
And it has changed the way the world sees people with intellectual disabilities.
I was born with epilepsy and an intellectual disability.
Growing up, I played hockey until I was 12 years old.
The older I got, the more I felt it was harder to keep up with everyone else, and I was angry and frustrated.
For a while, I did not play any sports, didn't have many friends and felt left out and sad.
There was a time when people with intellectual disabilities were hidden away from society.
No one thought they could participate in sports, let alone be a valued member of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the effects of regular exercise on the fitness levels of children with intellectual disabilities.
Using rigorous scientific research, Dr. Hayden and other researchers came to the conclusion that it was simply the lack of opportunity to participate that caused their fitness levels to suffer.
Lots of people doubted that people with intellectual disabilities could benefit from fitness programs and sports competition opportunities.
But pioneers like Dr. Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founder of Special Olympics, persevered, and Special Olympics athletes have proved them right four and a half million times over.
(Applause) Before I joined Special Olympics, I was nervous because I was young, shy, not confident and didn't have many friends.
When I got there, though, everyone was very encouraging, supportive, and let me be myself without being judged.
Now, I am a basketball player and speed skater who has competed at provincial, national games, and this year made it all the way to the World Summer Games in LA, where I was part of the first ever Canadian basketball team to compete at World Games.
(Applause) I am one of more than four and a half million athletes around the globe, and I've heard so many similar stories.
Being Special Olympics athletes restores our pride and dignity.
Special Olympics also addresses critical health needs.
Studies have shown that, on average, men with intellectual disabilities die 13 years younger than men without, and women with intellectual disabilities die 20 years younger than women without.
Special Olympics keeps us healthy by getting us active and participating in sport.
Also, our coaches teach us about nutrition and health.
Special Olympics also provides free health screening for athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctor or accessing health care.
At the 2015 World Summer Games, my Team Canada teammates and I played the Nigerian basketball team.
The day before our game, the Nigerian basketball team went to the World Games Healthy Athlete screening, where seven of 10 members were given hearing aids for free and got to hear clearly for the first time.
(Applause) The change in them was amazing.
They were more excited, happy and confident, because their coach could vocally communicate with them.
And they were emotional because they could hear the sounds of the basketball, the sounds of the whistle and the cheering fans in the stands -- sounds that we take for granted.
Special Olympics is transforming more than just the athlete in their sport.
Special Olympics is transforming their lives off the field.
This year, research findings showed that nearly half of the adults in the US don't know a single person with an intellectual disability, and the 44 percent of Americans who don't have personal contact with intellectual disabilities are significantly less accepting and positive.
Then there's the r-word, proving that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to far too many people.
People use it as a casual term or an insult.
It was tweeted more than nine million times last year, and it is deeply hurtful to me and my four and a half million fellow athletes around the planet.
People don't think it's insulting, but it is.
As my fellow athlete and global messenger John Franklin Stephens wrote in an open letter to a political pundit who used the r-word as an insult, "Come join us someday at Special Olympics.
See if you walk away with your heart unchanged."
(Applause) This year, at the 2015 World Summer Games, people lined up for hours to get into the final night of powerlifting competition.
So it was standing room only when my teammate Jackie Barrett, the Newfoundland Moose, deadlifted 655 pounds and lifted 611 pounds in the squat -- (Applause) setting huge new records for Special Olympics.
Jackie is a record holder among all powerlifters in Newfoundland -- not just Special Olympics, all powerlifters.
Jackie was a huge star in LA, and ESPN live-tweeted his record-breaking lifts and were wowed by his performance.
Fifty years ago, few imagined individuals with intellectual disabilities could do anything like that.
This year, 60,000 spectators filled the famous LA Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremonies of World Games and cheer athletes from 165 countries around the world.
Far from being hidden away, we were cheered and celebrated.
Special Olympics teaches athletes to be confident and proud of themselves.
Special Olympics teaches the world that people with intellectual disabilities deserve respect and inclusion.
(Applause) Now, I have dreams and achievements in my sport, great coaches, respect and dignity, better health, and I am pursuing a career as a personal trainer.
(Applause) I am no longer hidden, bullied and I am here doing a TED Talk.
(Applause) The world is a different place because of Special Olympics, but there is still farther to go.
So the next time you see someone with an intellectual disability, I hope you will see their ability.
The next time someone uses the r-word near you, I hope you will tell them how much it hurts.
I hope you will think about getting involved with Special Olympics.
(Applause) I would like to leave you with one final thought.
Nelson Mandela said, "Sports has the power to change the world."
Special Olympics is changing the world by transforming four and a half million athletes and giving us a place to be confident, meet friends, not be judged and get to feel like and be champions.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
You and nine other individuals have been captured by super intelligent alien overlords.
The aliens think humans look quite tasty, but their civilization forbids eating highly logical and cooperative beings.
Unfortunately, they're not sure whether you qualify, so they decide to give you all a test.
Through its universal translator, the alien guarding you tells you the following: You will be placed in a single-file line facing forward in size order so that each of you can see everyone lined up ahead of you.
You will not be able to look behind you or step out of line.
Each of you will have either a black or a white hat on your head assigned randomly, and I won't tell you how many of each color there are.
When I say to begin, each of you must guess the color of your hat starting with the person in the back and moving up the line.
And don't even try saying words other than black or white or signaling some other way, like intonation or volume; you'll all be eaten immediately.
If at least nine of you guess correctly, you'll all be spared.
You have five minutes to discuss and come up with a plan, and then I'll line you up, assign your hats, and we'll begin.
Can you think of a strategy guaranteed to save everyone?
Pause the video now to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 The key is that the person at the back of the line who can see everyone else's hats can use the words "black" or "white" to communicate some coded information.
So what meaning can be assigned to those words that will allow everyone else to deduce their hat colors?
It can't be the total number of black or white hats.
There are more than two possible values, but what does have two possible values is that number's parity, that is whether it's odd or even.
So the solution is to agree that whoever goes first will, for example, say "black" if he sees an odd number of black hats and "white" if he sees an even number of black hats.
Let's see how it would play out if the hats were distributed like this.
The tallest captive sees three black hats in front of him, so he says "black," telling everyone else he sees an odd number of black hats.
He gets his own hat color wrong, but that's okay since you're collectively allowed to have one wrong answer.
Prisoner two also sees an odd number of black hats, so she knows hers is white, and answers correctly.
Prisoner three sees an even number of black hats, so he knows that his must be one of the black hats the first two prisoners saw.
Prisoner four hears that and knows that she should be looking for an even number of black hats since one was behind her.
But she only sees one, so she deduces that her hat is also black.
Prisoners five through nine are each looking for an odd number of black hats, which they see, so they figure out that their hats are white.
Now it all comes down to you at the front of the line.
If the ninth prisoner saw an odd number of black hats, that can only mean one thing.
You'll find that this strategy works for any possible arrangement of the hats.
The first prisoner has a 50% chance of giving a wrong answer about his own hat, but the parity information he conveys allows everyone else to guess theirs with absolute certainty.
Each begins by expecting to see an odd or even number of hats of the specified color.
If what they count doesn't match, that means their own hat is that color.
And everytime this happens, the next person in line will switch the parity they expect to see.
So that's it, you're free to go.
It looks like these aliens will have to go hungry, or find some less logical organisms to abduct.
When faced with a big challenge where potential failure seems to lurk at every corner, maybe you've heard this advice before: "Be more confident."
And most likely, this is what you think when you hear it: "If only it were that simple."
But what is confidence?
Take the belief that you are valuable, worthwhile, and capable, also known as self-esteem, add in the optimism that comes when you are certain of your abilities, and then empowered by these, act courageously to face a challenge head-on.
This is confidence.
It turns thoughts into action.
So where does confidence even come from?
There are several factors that impact confidence.
One: what you're born with, such as your genes, which will impact things like the balance of neurochemicals in your brain.
Two: how you're treated.
This includes the social pressures of your environment.
And three: the part you have control over, the choices you make, the risks you take, and how you think about and respond to challenges and setbacks.
It isn't possible to completely untangle these three factors, but the personal choices we make certainly play a major role in confidence development.
So, by keeping in mind a few practical tips, we do actually have the power to cultivate our own confidence.
Tip 1: a quick fix.
There are a few tricks that can give you an immediate confidence boost in the short term.
Picture your success when you're beginning a difficult task, something as simple as listening to music with deep bass; it can promote feelings of power.
You can even strike a powerful pose or give yourself a pep talk.
Tip two: believe in your ability to improve.
If you're looking for a long-term change, consider the way you think about your abilities and talents.
Do you think they are fixed at birth, or that they can be developed, like a muscle?
These beliefs matter because they can influence how you act when you're faced with setbacks.
If you have a fixed mindset, meaning that you think your talents are locked in place, you might give up, assuming you've discovered something you're not very good at.
But if you have a growth mindset and think your abilities can improve, a challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow.
Neuroscience supports the growth mindset.
The connections in your brain do get stronger and grow with study and practice.
It also turns out, on average, people who have a growth mindset are more successful, getting better grades, and doing better in the face of challenges.
Tip three: practice failure.
Face it, you're going to fail sometimes.
Everyone does.
J.K. Rowling was rejected by twelve different publishers before one picked up "Harry Potter."
The Wright Brothers built on history's failed attempts at flight, including some of their own, before designing a successful airplane.
Studies show that those who fail regularly and keep trying anyway are better equipped to respond to challenges and setbacks in a constructive way.
They learn how to try different strategies, ask others for advice, and perservere.
So, think of a challenge you want to take on, realize it's not going to be easy, accept that you'll make mistakes, and be kind to yourself when you do.
Give yourself a pep talk, stand up, and go for it.
The excitement you'll feel knowing that whatever the result, you'll have gained greater knowledge and understanding.
This is confidence.
In medieval times, alchemists tried to achieve the seemingly impossible.
They wanted to transform lowly lead into gleaming gold.
History portrays these people as aged eccentrics, but if only they'd known that their dreams were actually achievable.
Indeed, today we can manufacture gold on Earth thanks to modern inventions that those medieval alchemists missed by a few centuries.
But to understand how this precious metal became embedded in our planet to start with, we have to gaze upwards at the stars.
Gold is extraterrestrial.
Instead of arising from the planet's rocky crust, it was actually cooked up in space and is present on Earth because of cataclysmic stellar explosions called supernovae.
Stars are mostly made up of hydrogen, the simplest and lightest element.
The enormous gravitational pressure of so much material compresses and triggers nuclear fusion in the star's core.
This process releases energy from the hydrogen, making the star shine.
Over many millions of years, fusion transforms hydrogen into heavier elements: helium, carbon, and oxygen, burning subsequent elements faster and faster to reach iron and nickel.
However, at that point nuclear fusion no longer releases enough energy, and the pressure from the core peters out.
The outer layers collapse into the center, and bouncing back from this sudden injection of energy, the star explodes forming a supernova.
The extreme pressure of a collapsing star is so high, that subatomic protons and electrons are forced together in the core, forming neutrons.
Neutrons have no repelling electric charge so they're easily captured by the iron group elements.
Multiple neutron captures enable the formation of heavier elements that a star under normal circumstances can't form, from silver to gold, past lead and on to uranium.
In extreme contrast to the million year transformation of hydrogen to helium, the creation of the heaviest elements in a supernova takes place in only seconds.
But what becomes of the gold after the explosion?
The expanding supernova shockwave propels its elemental debris through the interstellar medium, triggering a swirling dance of gas and dust that condenses into new stars and planets.
Earth's gold was likely delivered this way before being kneaded into veins by geothermal activity.
Billions of years later, we now extract this precious product by mining it, an expensive process that's compounded by gold's rarity.
In fact, all of the gold that we've mined in history could be piled into just three Olympic-size swimming pools, although this represents a lot of mass because gold is about 20 times denser than water.
So, can we produce more of this coveted commodity?
Actually, yes.
Using particle accelerators, we can mimic the complex nuclear reactions that create gold in stars.
But these machines can only construct gold atom by atom.
So it would take almost the age of the universe to produce one gram at a cost vastly exceeding the current value of gold.
So that's not a very good solution.
But if we were to reach a hypothetical point where we'd mined all of the Earth's buried gold, there are other places we could look.
The ocean holds an estimated 20 million tons of dissolved gold but at extremely miniscule concentrations making its recovery too costly at present.
Perhaps one day, we'll see gold rushes to tap the mineral wealth of the other planets of our solar system.
And who knows?
Maybe some future supernova will occur close enough to shower us with its treasure and hopefully not eradicate all life on Earth in the process.
A handful of species on Earth share a seemingly mysterious trait: a menstrual cycle.
We're one of the select few.
Monkeys, apes, bats, humans, and possibly elephant shrews are the only mammals on Earth that menstruate.
We also do it more than any other animal, even though its a waste of nutrients and can be a physical inconvenience.
So where's the sense in this uncommon biological process?
The answer begins with pregnancy.
During this process, the body's resources are cleverly used to shape a suitable environment for a fetus, creating an internal haven for a mother to nurture her growing child.
In this respect, pregnancy is awe-inspiring, but that's only half the story.
The other half reveals that pregnancy places a mother and her child at odds.
As for all living creatures, the human body evolved to promote the spread of its genes.
For the mother, that means she should try to provide equally for all her offspring.
But a mother and her fetus don't share exactly the same genes.
The fetus inherits genes from its father, as well, and those genes can promote their own survival by extracting more than their fair share of resources from the mother.
This evolutionary conflict of interests places a woman and her unborn child in a biological tug-of-war that plays out inside the womb.
One factor contributing to this internal tussle is the placenta, the fetal organ that connects to the mother's blood supply and nourishes the fetus while it grows.
In most mammals, the placenta is confined behind a barrier of maternal cells.
This barrier lets the mother control the supply of nutrients to the fetus.
But in humans and a few other species, the placenta actually penetrates right into the mother's circulatory system to directly access her blood stream.
Through its placenta, the fetus pumps the mother's arteries with hormones that keep them open to provide a permanent flow of nutrient-rich blood.
A fetus with such unrestricted access can manufacture hormones to increase the mother's blood sugar, dilate her arteries, and inflate her blood pressure.
Most mammal mothers can expel or reabsorb embryos if required, but in humans, once the fetus is connected to the blood supply, severing that connection can result in hemorrhage.
If the fetus develops poorly or dies, the mother's health is endangered.
As it grows, a fetus's ongoing need for resources can cause intense fatigue, high blood pressure, and conditions like diabetes and preeclampsia.
Because of these risks, pregnancy is always a huge, and sometimes dangerous, investment.
So it makes sense that the body should screen embryos carefully to find out which ones are worth the challenge.
This is where menstruation fits in.
Pregnancy starts with a process called implantation, where the embryo embeds itself in the endometrium that lines the uterus.
The endometrium evolved to make implantation difficult so that only the healthy embryos could survive.
But in doing so, it also selected for the most vigorously invasive embryos, creating an evolutionary feedback loop.
The embryo engages in a complex, exquisitely timed hormonal dialogue that transforms the endometrium to allow implantation.
What happens when an embryo fails the test?
It might still manage to attach, or even get partly through the endometrium.
As it slowly dies, it could leave its mother vulnerable to infection, and all the time, it may be emitting hormonal signals that disrupt her tissues.
The body avoids this problem by simply removing every possible risk.
Each time ovulation doesn't result in a healthy pregnancy, the womb gets rid of its endometrial lining, along with any unfertilized eggs, sick, dying, or dead embryos.
That protective process is known as menstruation, leading to the period.
This biological trait, bizarre as it may be, sets us on course for the continuation of the human race.
Cramming for a test?
Trying to get more done than you have time to do?
Stress is a feeling we all experience when we are challenged or overwhelmed.
But more than just an emotion, stress is a hardwired physical response that travels throughout your entire body.
In the short term, stress can be advantageous, but when activated too often or too long, your primitive fight or flight stress response not only changes your brain but also damages many of the other organs and cells throughout your body.
Your adrenal gland releases the stress hormones cortisol, epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, and norepinephrine.
As these hormones travel through your blood stream, they easily reach your blood vessels and heart.
Adrenaline causes your heart to beat faster and raises your blood pressure, over time causing hypertension.
Cortisol can also cause the endothelium, or inner lining of blood vessels, to not function normally.
Scientists now know that this is an early step in triggering the process of atherosclerosis or cholesterol plaque build up in your arteries.
Together, these changes increase your chances of a heart attack or stroke.
When your brain senses stress, it activates your autonomic nervous system.
Through this network of nerve connections, your big brain communicates stress to your enteric, or intestinal nervous system.
Besides causing butterflies in your stomach, this brain-gut connection can disturb the natural rhythmic contractions that move food through your gut, leading to irritable bowel syndrome, and can increase your gut sensitivity to acid, making you more likely to feel heartburn.
Via the gut's nervous system, stress can also change the composition and function of your gut bacteria, which may affect your digestive and overall health.
Speaking of digestion, does chronic stress affect your waistline?
Well, yes.
Cortisol can increase your appetite.
It tells your body to replenish your energy stores with energy dense foods and carbs, causing you to crave comfort foods.
High levels of cortisol can also cause you to put on those extra calories as visceral or deep belly fat.
This type of fat doesn't just make it harder to button your pants.
It is an organ that actively releases hormones and immune system chemicals called cytokines that can increase your risk of developing chronic diseases, such as heart disease and insulin resistance.
Meanwhile, stress hormones affect immune cells in a variety of ways.
Initially, they help prepare to fight invaders and heal after injury, but chronic stress can dampen function of some immune cells, make you more susceptible to infections, and slow the rate you heal.
Want to live a long life?
You may have to curb your chronic stress.
That's because it has even been associated with shortened telomeres, the shoelace tip ends of chromosomes that measure a cell's age.
Telomeres cap chromosomes to allow DNA to get copied every time a cell divides without damaging the cell's genetic code, and they shorten with each cell division.
When telomeres become too short, a cell can no longer divide and it dies.
As if all that weren't enough, chronic stress has even more ways it can sabotage your health, including acne, hair loss, sexual dysfunction, headaches, muscle tension, difficulty concentrating, fatigue, and irritability.
So, what does all this mean for you?
Your life will always be filled with stressful situations.
But what matters to your brain and entire body is how you respond to that stress.
If you can view those situations as challenges you can control and master, rather than as threats that are insurmountable, you will perform better in the short run and stay healthy in the long run.
How is it that so many intergalactic species in movies and TV just happen to speak perfect English?
The short answer is that no one wants to watch a starship crew spend years compiling an alien dictionary.
But to keep things consistent, the creators of Star Trek and other science-fiction worlds have introduced the concept of a universal translator, a portable device that can instantly translate between any languages.
So is a universal translator possible in real life?
We already have many programs that claim to do just that, taking a word, sentence, or entire book in one language and translating it into almost any other, whether it's modern English or Ancient Sanskrit.
And if translation were just a matter of looking up words in a dictionary, these programs would run circles around humans.
The reality, however, is a bit more complicated.
A rule-based translation program uses a lexical database, which includes all the words you'd find in a dictionary and all grammatical forms they can take, and set of rules to recognize the basic linguistic elements in the input language.
For a seemingly simple sentence like, "The children eat the muffins," the program first parses its syntax, or grammatical structure, by identifying the children as the subject, and the rest of the sentence as the predicate consisting of a verb "eat," and a direct object "the muffins."
It then needs to recognize English morphology, or how the language can be broken down into its smallest meaningful units, such as the word muffin and the suffix "s," used to indicate plural.
Finally, it needs to understand the semantics, what the different parts of the sentence actually mean.
To translate this sentence properly, the program would refer to a different set of vocabulary and rules for each element of the target language.
But this is where it gets tricky.
The syntax of some languages allows words to be arranged in any order, while in others, doing so could make the muffin eat the child.
Morphology can also pose a problem.
Slovene distinguishes between two children and three or more using a dual suffix absent in many other languages, while Russian's lack of definite articles might leave you wondering whether the children are eating some particular muffins, or just eat muffins in general.
Finally, even when the semantics are technically correct, the program might miss their finer points, such as whether the children "mangiano" the muffins, or "divorano" them.
Another method is statistical machine translation, which analyzes a database of books, articles, and documents that have already been translated by humans.
By finding matches between source and translated text that are unlikely to occur by chance, the program can identify corresponding phrases and patterns, and use them for future translations.
However, the quality of this type of translation depends on the size of the initial database and the availability of samples for certain languages or styles of writing.
The difficulty that computers have with the exceptions, irregularities and shades of meaning that seem to come instinctively to humans has led some researchers to believe that our understanding of language is a unique product of our biological brain structure.
In fact, one of the most famous fictional universal translators, the Babel fish from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", is not a machine at all but a small creature that translates the brain waves and nerve signals of sentient species through a form of telepathy.
For now, learning a language the old fashioned way will still give you better results than any currently available computer program.
But this is no easy task, and the sheer number of languages in the world, as well as the increasing interaction between the people who speak them, will only continue to spur greater advances in automatic translation.
Perhaps by the time we encounter intergalactic life forms, we'll be able to communicate with them through a tiny gizmo, or we might have to start compiling that dictionary, after all.
So I come from the tallest people on the planet -- the Dutch.
It hasn't always been this way.
In fact, all across the globe, people have been gaining height.
In the last 150 years, in developed countries, on average, we have gotten 10 centimeters taller.
And scientists have a lot of theories about why this is, but almost all of them involve nutrition, namely the increase of dairy and meat.
In the last 50 years, global meat consumption has more than quadrupled, from 71 million tons to 310 million tons.
Something similar has been going on with milk and eggs.
In every society where incomes have risen, so has protein consumption.
And we know that globally, we are getting richer.
And as the middle class is on the rise, so is our global population, from 7 billion of us today to 9.7 billion by 2050, which means that by 2050, we are going to need at least 70 percent more protein than what is available to humankind today.
And the latest prediction of the UN puts that population number, by the end of this century, at 11 billion, which means that we are going to need a lot more protein.
This challenge is staggering -- so much so, that recently, a team at Anglia Ruskin Global Sustainability Institute suggested that if we don't change our global policies and food production systems, our societies might actually collapse in the next 30 years.
Currently, our ocean serves as the main source of animal protein.
Over 2.6 billion people depend on it every single day.
At the same time, our global fisheries are two-and-a-half times larger than what our oceans can sustainably support, meaning that humans take far more fish from the ocean than the oceans can naturally replace.
WWF recently published a report showing that just in the last 40 years, our global marine life has been slashed in half.
And another recent report suggests that of our largest predatory species, such as swordfish and bluefin tuna, over 90 percent has disappeared since the 1950s.
And there are a lot of great, sustainable fishing initiatives across the planet working towards better practices and better-managed fisheries.
But ultimately, all of these initiatives are working towards keeping current catch constant.
It's unlikely, even with the best-managed fisheries, that we are going to be able to take much more from the ocean than we do today.
We have to stop plundering our oceans the way we have.
We need to alleviate the pressure on it.
And we are at a point where if we push much harder for more produce, we might face total collapse.
Our current systems are not going to feed a growing global population.
So how do we fix this?
What's the world going to look like in just 35 short years when there's 2.7 billion more of us sharing the same resources?
We could all become vegan.
Sounds like a great idea, but it's not realistic and it's impossibly hard to mandate globally.
People are eating animal protein whether we like it or not.
And suppose we fail to change our ways and continue on the current path, failing to meet demands.
The World Health Organization recently reported that 800 million people are suffering from malnutrition and food shortage, which is due to that same growing, global population and the declining access to resources like water, energy and land.
It takes very little imagination to picture a world of global unrest, riots and further malnutrition.
People are hungry, and we are running dangerously low on natural resources.
For so, so many reasons, we need to change our global food production systems.
We must do better and there is a solution.
And that solution lies in aquaculture -- the farming of fish, plants like seaweed, shellfish and crustaceans.
As the great ocean hero Jacques Cousteau once said, "We must start using the ocean as farmers instead of hunters.
That's what civilization is all about -- farming instead of hunting."
Fish is the last food that we hunt.
And why is it that we keep hearing phrases like, "Life's too short for farmed fish," or, "Wild-caught, of course!"
over fish that we know virtually nothing about?
We don't know what it ate during its lifetime, and we don't know what pollution it encounters.
And if it was a large predatory species, it might have gone through the coast of Fukushima yesterday.
We don't know.
Very few people realize the traceability in fisheries never goes beyond the hunter that caught the wild animal.
But let's back up for a second and talk about why fish is the best food choice.
It's healthy, it prevents heart disease, it provides key amino acids and key fatty acids like Omega-3s, which is very different from almost any other type of meat.
And aside from being healthy, it's also a lot more exciting and diverse.
Think about it -- most animal farming is pretty monotonous.
Cow is cow, sheep is sheep, pig's pig, and poultry -- turkey, duck, chicken -- pretty much sums it up.
And then there's 500 species of fish being farmed currently.
not that Western supermarkets reflect that on their shelves, but that's beside that point.
And you can farm fish in a very healthy manner that's good for us, good for the planet and good for the fish.
I know I sound fish-obsessed -- (Laughter) Let me explain: My brilliant partner and wife, Amy Novograntz, and I got involved in aquaculture a couple of years ago.
We were inspired by Sylvia Earle, who won the TED Prize in 2009.
We actually met on Mission Blue I in the Galapagos.
Amy was there as the TED Prize Director; me, an entrepreneur from the Netherlands and concerned citizen, love to dive, passion for the oceans.
Mission Blue truly changed our lives.
We fell in love, got married and we came away really inspired, thinking we really want to do something about ocean conservation -- something that was meant to last, that could make a real difference and something that we could do together.
Little did we expect that that would lead us to fish farming.
But a few months after we got off the boat, we got to a meeting at Conservation International, where the Director General of WorldFish was talking about aquaculture, asking a room full of environmentalists to stop turning from it, realize what was going on and to really get involved because aquaculture has the potential to be just what our oceans and populations need.
We were stunned when we heard the stats that we didn't know more about this industry already and excited about the chance to help get it right.
And to talk about stats -- right now, the amount of fish consumed globally, wild catch and farmed combined, is twice the tonnage of the total amount of beef produced on planet earth last year.
Every single fishing vessel combined, small and large, across the globe, together produce about 65 million tons of wild-caught seafood for human consumption.
Aquaculture this year, for the first time in history, actually produces more than what we catch from the wild.
But now this: Demand is going to go up.
In the next 35 years, we are going to need an additional 85 million tons to meet demand, which is one-and-a-half times as much, almost, as what we catch globally out of our oceans.
An enormous number.
It's safe to assume that that's not going to come from the ocean.
It needs to come from farming.
And talk about farming -- for farming you need resources.
As a human needs to eat to grow and stay alive, so does an animal.
A cow needs to eat eight to nine pounds of feed and drink almost 8,000 liters of water to create just one pound of meat.
Experts agree that it's impossible to farm cows for every inhabitant on this planet.
We just don't have enough feed or water.
And we can't keep cutting down rain forests for it.
And fresh water -- planet earth has a very limited supply.
We need something more efficient to keep humankind alive on this planet.
And now let's compare that with fish farming.
You can farm one pound of fish with just one pound of feed, and depending on species, even less.
And why is that?
Well, that's because fish, first of all, float.
They don't need to stand around all day resisting gravity like we do.
And most fish are cold-blooded -- they don't need to heat themselves.
Fish chills.
(Laughter) And it needs very little water, which is counterintuitive, but as we say, it swims in it but it hardly drinks it.
Fish are the most resource-efficient animal protein available to humankind, aside from insects.
How much we've learned since.
For example, on top of that 65 million tons that's annually caught for human consumption, there's an additional 30 million tons caught for animal feed, mostly sardines and anchovies for the aquaculture industry that's turned into fish meal and fish oil.
This is madness.
Sixty-five percent of these fisheries, globally, are badly managed.
Some of the worst issues of our time are connected to it.
It's destroying our oceans.
The worst slavery issues imaginable are connected to it.
Recently, an article came out of Stanford saying that if 50 percent of the world's aquaculture industry would stop using fish meal, our oceans would be saved.
Now think about that for a minute.
Now, we know that the oceans have far more problems -- they have pollution, there's acidification, coral reef destruction and so on.
But it underlines the impact of our fisheries, and it underlines how interconnected everything is.
Fisheries, aquaculture, deforestation, climate change, food security and so on.
In the search for alternatives, the industry, on a massive scale, has reverted to plant-based alternatives like soy, industrial chicken waste, blood meal from slaughterhouses and so on.
And we understand where these choices come from, but this is not the right approach.
It's not sustainable, it's not healthy.
Have you ever seen a chicken at the bottom of the ocean?
Of course not.
If you feed salmon soy with nothing else, it literally explodes.
Salmon is a carnivore, it has no way to digest soy.
Now, fish farming is by far the best animal farming available to humankind.
But it's had a really bad reputation.
There's been excessive use of chemicals, there's been virus and disease transfered to wild populations, ecosystem destruction and pollution, escaped fish breeding with wild populations, altering the overall genetic pool, and then of course, as just mentioned, the unsustainable feed ingredients.
How blessed were the days when we could just enjoy food that was on our plate, whatever it was.
Once you know, you know.
You can't go back.
It's not fun.
We really need a transparent food system that we can trust, that produces healthy food.
But the good news is that decades of development and research have led to a lot of new technologies and knowledge that allow us to do a lot better.
We can now farm fish without any of these issues.
I think of agriculture before the green revolution -- we are at aquaculture and the blue revolution.
New technologies means that we can now produce a feed that's perfectly natural, with a minimal footprint that consists of microbes, insects, seaweeds and micro-algae.
Healthy for the people, healthy for the fish, healthy for the planet.
Microbes, for example, can be a perfect alternative for high-grade fish meal -- at scale.
Insects are the -- well, first of all, the perfect recycling because they're grown on food waste; but second, think of fly-fishing, and you know how logical it actually is to use it as fish feed.
You don't need large tracts of land for it and you don't need to cut down rain forests for it.
And microbes and insects are actually net water producers.
This revolution is starting as we speak, it just needs scale.
We can now farm far more species than ever before in controlled, natural conditions, creating happy fish.
I imagine, for example, a closed system that's performing more efficiently than insect farming, where you can produce healthy, happy, delicious fish with little or no effluent, almost no energy and almost no water and a natural feed with a minimal footprint.
Or a system where you grow up to 10 species next to each other -- off of each other, mimicking nature.
You need very little feed, very little footprint.
I think of seaweed growing off the effluent of fish, for example.
There's great technologies popping up all over the globe.
From alternatives to battle disease so we don't need antibiotics and chemicals anymore, to automated feeders that feel when the fish are hungry, so we can save on feed and create less pollution.
Software systems that gather data across farms, so we can improve farm practices.
There's really cool stuff happening all over the globe.
And make no mistake -- all of these things are possible at a cost that's competitive to what a farmer spends today.
Tomorrow, there will be no excuse for anyone to not do the right thing.
So somebody needs to connect the dots and give these developments a big kick in the butt.
And that's what we've been working on the last couple of years, and that's what we need to be working on together -- rethinking everything from the ground up, with a holistic view across the value chain, connecting all these things across the globe, alongside great entrepreneurs that are willing to share a collective vision.
Now is the time to create change in this industry and to push it into a sustainable direction.
This industry is still young, much of its growth is still ahead.
It's a big task, but not as far-fetched as you might think.
It's possible.
So we need to take pressure off the ocean.
We want to eat good and healthy.
And if we eat an animal, it needs to be one that had a happy and healthy life.
We need to have a meal that we can trust, live long lives.
And this is not just for people in San Francisco or Northern Europe -- this is for all of us.
Even in the poorest countries, it's not just about money.
People prefer something fresh and healthy that they can trust over something that comes from far away that they know nothing about.
We're all the same.
The day will come where people will realize -- no, demand -- farmed fish on their plate that's farmed well and that's farmed healthy -- and refuse anything less.
You can help speed this up.
Ask questions when you order seafood.
Where does my fish come from?
Who raised it, and what did it eat?
Information about where your fish comes from and how it was produced needs to be much more readily available.
And consumers need to put pressure on the aquaculture industry to do the right thing.
So every time you order, ask for detail and show that you really care about what you eat and what's been given to you.
And eventually, they will listen.
And all of us will benefit.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Imagine an airplane flying one millimeter above the ground and circling the Earth once every 25 seconds while counting every blade of grass.
Shrink all that down so that it fits in the palm of your hand, and you'd have something equivalent to a modern hard drive, an object that can likely hold more information than your local library.
So how does it store so much information in such a small space?
At the heart of every hard drive is a stack of high-speed spinning discs with a recording head flying over each surface.
Each disc is coated with a film of microscopic magnetised metal grains, and your data doesn't live there in a form you can recognize.
Instead, it is recorded as a magnetic pattern formed by groups of those tiny grains.
In each group, also known as a bit, all of the grains have their magnetization's aligned in one of two possible states, which correspond to zeroes and ones.
Data is written onto the disc by converting strings of bits into electrical current fed through an electromagnet.
This magnet generates a field strong enough to change the direction of the metal grain's magnetization.
Once this information is written onto the disc, the drive uses a magnetic reader to turn it back into a useful form, much like a phonograph needle translates a record's grooves into music.
But how can you get so much information out of just zeroes and ones?
Well, by putting lots of them together.
For example, a letter is represented in one byte, or eight bits, and your average photo takes up several megabytes, each of which is 8 million bits.
Because each bit must be written onto a physical area of the disc, we're always seeking to increase the disc's areal density, or how many bits can be squeezed into one square inch.
The areal density of a modern hard drive is about 600 gigabits per square inch, 300 million times greater than that of IBM's first hard drive from 1957.
This amazing advance in storage capacity wasn't just a matter of making everything smaller, but involved multiple innovations.
A technique called the thin film lithography process allowed engineers to shrink the reader and writer.
And despite its size, the reader became more sensitive by taking advantage of new discoveries in magnetic and quantum properties of matter.
Bits could also be packed closer together thanks to mathematical algorithms that filter out noise from magnetic interference, and find the most likely bit sequences from each chunk of read-back signal.
And thermal expansion control of the head, enabled by placing a heater under the magnetic writer, allowed it to fly less than five nanometers above the disc's surface, about the width of two strands of DNA.
For the past several decades, the exponential growth in computer storage capacity and processing power has followed a pattern known as Moore's Law, which, in 1975, predicted that information density would double every two years.
But at around 100 gigabits per square inch, shrinking the magnetic grains further or cramming them closer together posed a new risk called the superparamagnetic effect.
When a magnetic grain volume is too small, its magnetization is easily disturbed by heat energy and can cause bits to switch unintentionally, leading to data loss.
Scientists resolved this limitation in a remarkably simple way: by changing the direction of recording from longitudinal to perpendicular, allowing areal density to approach one terabit per square inch.
Recently, the potential limit has been increased yet again through heat assisted magnetic recording.
This uses an even more thermally stable recording medium, whose magnetic resistance is momentarily reduced by heating up a particular spot with a laser and allowing data to be written.
And while those drives are currently in the prototype stage, scientists already have the next potential trick up their sleeves: bit-patterned media, where bit locations are arranged in separate, nano-sized structures, potentially allowing for areal densities of twenty terabits per square inch or more.
So it's thanks to the combined efforts of generations of engineers, material scientists, and quantum physicists that this tool of incredible power and precision can spin in the palm of your hand.
Muscles.
We have over 600 of them.
They make up between 1/3 and 1/2 of our body weight, and along with connective tissue, they bind us together, hold us up, and help us move.
And whether or not body building is your hobby, muscles need your constant attention because the way you treat them on a daily basis determines whether they will wither or grow.
Say you're standing in front of a door, ready to pull it open.
Your brain and muscles are perfectly poised to help you achieve this goal.
First, your brain sends a signal to motor neurons inside your arm.
When they receive this message, they fire, causing muscles to contract and relax, which pull on the bones in your arm and generate the needed movement.
The bigger the challenge becomes, the bigger the brain's signal grows, and the more motor units it rallies to help you achieve your task.
But what if the door is made of solid iron?
At this point, your arm muscles alone won't be able to generate enough tension to pull it open, so your brain appeals to other muscles for help.
You plant your feet, tighten your belly, and tense your back, generating enough force to yank it open.
Your nervous system has just leveraged the resources you already have, other muscles, to meet the demand.
While all this is happening, your muscle fibers undergo another kind of cellular change.
As you expose them to stress, they experience microscopic damage, which, in this context, is a good thing.
In response, the injured cells release inflammatory molecules called cytokines that activate the immune system to repair the injury.
This is when the muscle-building magic happens.
The greater the damage to the muscle tissue, the more your body will need to repair itself.
The resulting cycle of damage and repair eventually makes muscles bigger and stronger as they adapt to progressively greater demands.
Since our bodies have already adapted to most everyday activities, those generally don't produce enough stress to stimulate new muscle growth.
So, to build new muscle, a process called hypertrophy, our cells need to be exposed to higher workloads than they are used to.
In fact, if you don't continuously expose your muscles to some resistance, they will shrink, a process known as muscular atrophy.
In contrast, exposing the muscle to a high-degree of tension, especially while the muscle is lengthening, also called an eccentric contraction, generates effective conditions for new growth.
However, muscles rely on more than just activity to grow.
Without proper nutrition, hormones, and rest, your body would never be able to repair damaged muscle fibers.
Protein in our diet preserves muscle mass by providing the building blocks for new tissue in the form of amino acids.
Adequate protein intake, along with naturally occurring hormones, like insulin-like growth factor and testosterone, help shift the body into a state where tissue is repaired and grown.
This vital repair process mainly occurs when we're resting, especially at night while sleeping.
Gender and age affect this repair mechanism, which is why young men with more testosterone have a leg up in the muscle building game.
Genetic factors also play a role in one's ability to grow muscle.
Some people have more robust immune reactions to muscle damage, and are better able to repair and replace damaged muscle fibers, increasing their muscle-building potential.
The body responds to the demands you place on it.
If you tear your muscles up, eat right, rest and repeat, you'll create the conditions to make your muscles as big and strong as possible.
It is with muscles as it is with life: Meaningful growth requires challenge and stress.
Are you sleeping restlessly, feeling irritable or moody, forgetting little things, and feeling overwhelmed and isolated?
Don't worry. We've all been there.
You're probably just stressed out.
Stress isn't always a bad thing.
It can be handy for a burst of extra energy and focus, like when you're playing a competitive sport, or have to speak in public.
But when its continuous, the kind most of us face day in and day out, it actually begins to change your brain.
Chronic stress, like being overworked or having arguments at home, can affect brain size, its structure, and how it functions, right down to the level of your genes.
Stress begins with something called the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis, a series of interactions between endocrine glands in the brain and on the kidney, which controls your body's reaction to stress.
When your brain detects a stressful situation, your HPA axis is instantly activated and releases a hormone called cortisol, which primes your body for instant action.
But high levels of cortisol over long periods of time wreak havoc on your brain.
For example, chronic stress increases the activity level and number of neural connections in the amygdala, your brain's fear center.
And as levels of cortisol rise, electric signals in your hippocampus, the part of the brain associated with learning, memories, and stress control, deteriorate.
The hippocampus also inhibits the activity of the HPA axis, so when it weakens, so does your ability to control your stress.
That's not all, though.
Cortisol can literally cause your brain to shrink in size.
Too much of it results in the loss of synaptic connections between neurons and the shrinking of your prefrontal cortex, the part of your brain the regulates behaviors like concentration, decision-making, judgement, and social interaction.
It also leads to fewer new brain cells being made in the hippocampus.
This means chronic stress might make it harder for you to learn and remember things, and also set the stage for more serious mental problems, like depression and eventually Alzheimer's disease.
The effects of stress may filter right down to your brain's DNA.
An experiment showed that the amount of nurturing a mother rat provides its newborn baby plays a part in determining how that baby responds to stress later in life.
The pups of nurturing moms turned out less sensitive to stress because their brains developed more cortisol receptors, which stick to cortisol and dampen the stress response.
The pups of negligent moms had the opposite outcome, and so became more sensitive to stress throughout life.
These are considered epigenetic changes, meaning that they effect which genes are expressed without directly changing the genetic code.
And these changes can be reversed if the moms are swapped.
But there's a surprising result.
The epigenetic changes caused by one single mother rat were passed down to many generations of rats after her.
In other words, the results of these actions were inheritable.
It's not all bad news, though.
There are many ways to reverse what cortisol does to your stressed brain.
The most powerful weapons are exercise and meditation, which involves breathing deeply and being aware and focused on your surroundings.
Both of these activities decrease your stress and increase the size of the hippocampus, thereby improving your memory.
So don't feel defeated by the pressures of daily life.
Get in control of your stress before it takes control of you.
Imagine if you could plug your brain into a machine that would bring you ultimate pleasure for the rest of your life.
If you were given the choice to sign up for that kind of existence, would you?
That's the question philosopher Robert Nozick posed through a thought experiment he called the Experience Machine.
The experiment asks us to consider a world in which scientists have developed a machine that would simulate real life while guaranteeing experiences of only pleasure and never pain.
The catch?
You have to permanently leave reality behind, but you'll hardly know the difference.
Your experiences will be indistinguishable from reality.
Life's natural ups and downs will just be replaced with an endless series of ups.
Sounds great, right?
It may seem like a tempting offer, but perhaps it's not as ideal as it sounds.
The experiment was actually designed to refute a philosophical notion called hedonism.
According to hedonists, maximizing net pleasure is the most important thing in life because pleasure is the greatest good that life has to offer.
For hedonists, the best choice that a person could make for himself is one that brings him the greatest possible amount of pleasure while bringing him no pain.
Limitless pleasure minus zero pain equals maximum net pleasure, or in other words, the exact scenario the Experience Machine offers.
Therefore, if hedonism is your philosophy of choice, plugging in would be a no-brainer.
But what if there's more to life than just pleasure?
That's what Nozick believed he was demonstrating through his Experience Machine thought experiment.
Despite the machine's promise of maximum net pleasure, he still found reason not to plug in, as do many other experimenters who consider the proposition.
But what could possibly dissuade us from choosing a future of ultimate pleasure?
Consider this scenario.
Betsy and Xander are in a loving, committed relationship.
Betsy is head over heels and has never felt happier.
However, unbeknownst to Betsy, Xander has been romancing her sister, Angelica, with love letters and secret rendezvous for the duration of their relationship.
If Betsy found out, it would destroy her relationships with both Xander and Angelica, and the experience would be so traumatic, she would never love again.
Since Betsy is in blissful ignorance about Xander's infidelity, hedonists would say she's better off remaining in the dark and maintaining her high level of net pleasure.
As long as Betsy never finds out about the relationship, her life is guaranteed to go on as happily as it is right now.
So, is there value in Besty knowing the truth of her situation?
Imagine if you were Betsy.
Would you prefer to know the truth?
If the answer is yes, you'd be choosing an option that sharply decreases your net pleasure.
Perhaps, then, you believe that there are things in life with greater intrinsic value than pleasure.
Truth, knowledge, authentic connection with other human beings.
These are all things that might make the list.
By never learning the truth, Betsy is essentially living life in her own personal Experience Machine, a world of happiness that's not based in reality.
This love triangle is an extreme example, but it mirrors many of the decisions we make in day to day life.
So whether you're making a choice for Betsy or for yourself, why might you feel reality should be a factor?
Is there inherent value in real experiences, whether pleasurable or painful?
Do you yourself have more value when you're experiencing real life's pleasures and pains?
Nozick's experiment may not provide all the answers, but it forces us to consider whether real life, though imperfect, holds some intrinsic value beyond the pleasure of plugging in.
15 years ago, I volunteered to participate in a research study that involved a genetic test.
When I arrived at the clinic to be tested, I was handed a questionnaire.
One of the very first questions asked me to check a box for my race: White, black, Asian, or Native American.
I wasn't quite sure how to answer the question.
Was it aimed at measuring the diversity of research participants' social backgrounds?
In that case, I would answer with my social identity, and check the box for "black."
But what if the researchers were interested in investigating some association between ancestry and the risk for certain genetic traits?
In that case, wouldn't they want to know something about my ancestry, which is just as much European as African?
And how could they make scientific findings about my genes if I put down my social identity as a black woman?
After all, I consider myself a black woman with a white father rather than a white woman with a black mother entirely for social reasons.
Which racial identity I check has nothing to do with my genes.
Well, despite the obvious importance of this question to the study's scientific validity, I was told, "Don't worry about it, just put down however you identify yourself."
So I check "black," but I had no confidence in the results of a study that treated a critical variable so unscientifically.
That personal experience with the use of race in genetic testing got me thinking: Where else in medicine is race used to make false biological predictions?
Well, I found out that race runs deeply throughout all of medical practice.
It shapes physicians' diagnoses, measurements, treatments, prescriptions, even the very definition of diseases.
And the more I found out, the more disturbed I became.
Sociologists like me have long explained that race is a social construction.
When we identify people as black, white, Asian, Native American, Latina, we're referring to social groupings with made up demarcations that have changed over time and vary around the world.
As a legal scholar, I've also studied how lawmakers, not biologists, have invented the legal definitions of races.
And it's not just the view of social scientists.
You remember when the map of the human genome was unveiled at a White House ceremony in June 2000?
President Bill Clinton famously declared, "I believe one of the great truths to emerge from this triumphant expedition inside the human genome is that in genetic terms, human beings, regardless of race, are more than 99.9 percent the same."
And he might have added that that less than one percent of genetic difference doesn't fall into racial boxes.
Francis Collins, who led the Human Genome Project and now heads NIH, echoed President Clinton.
"I am happy that today, the only race we're talking about is the human race."
Doctors are supposed to practice evidence-based medicine, and they're increasingly called to join the genomic revolution.
But their habit of treating patients by race lags far behind.
Take the estimate of glomerular filtration rate, or GFR.
Doctors routinely interpret GFR, this important indicator of kidney function, by race.
As you can see in this lab test, the exact same creatinine level, the concentration in the blood of the patient, automatically produces a different GFR estimate depending on whether or not the patient is African-American.
Why?
I've been told it's based on an assumption that African-Americans have more muscle mass than people of other races.
But what sense does it make for a doctor to automatically assume I have more muscle mass than that female bodybuilder?
Wouldn't it be far more accurate and evidence-based to determine the muscle mass of individual patients just by looking at them?
Well, doctors tell me they're using race as a shortcut.
It's a crude but convenient proxy for more important factors, like muscle mass, enzyme level, genetic traits they just don't have time to look for.
But race is a bad proxy.
In many cases, race adds no relevant information at all.
It's just a distraction.
But race also tends to overwhelm the clinical measures.
It blinds doctors to patients' symptoms, family illnesses, their history, their own illnesses they might have -- all more evidence-based than the patient's race.
Race can't substitute for these important clinical measures without sacrificing patient well-being.
Doctors also tell me race is just one of many factors they take into account, but there are numerous medical tests, like the GFR, that use race categorically to treat black, white, Asian patients differently just because of their race.
Race medicine also leaves patients of color especially vulnerable to harmful biases and stereotypes.
Black and Latino patients are twice as likely to receive no pain medication as whites for the same painful long bone fractures because of stereotypes that black and brown people feel less pain, exaggerate their pain, and are predisposed to drug addiction.
The Food and Drug Administration has even approved a race-specific medicine.
It's a pill called BiDil to treat heart failure in self-identified African-American patients.
A cardiologist developed this drug without regard to race or genetics, but it became convenient for commercial reasons to market the drug to black patients.
The FDA then allowed the company, the drug company, to test the efficacy in a clinical trial that only included African-American subjects.
It speculated that race stood in as a proxy for some unknown genetic factor that affects heart disease or response to drugs.
But think about the dangerous message it sent, that black people's bodies are so substandard, a drug tested in them is not guaranteed to work in other patients.
In the end, the drug company's marketing scheme failed.
For one thing, black patients were understandably wary of using a drug just for black people.
One elderly black woman stood up in a community meeting and shouted, "Give me what the white people are taking!"
(Laughter) And if you find race-specific medicine surprising, wait until you learn that many doctors in the United States still use an updated version of a diagnostic tool that was developed by a physician during the slavery era, a diagnostic tool that is tightly linked to justifications for slavery.
Dr. Samuel Cartwright graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Medical School.
He practiced in the Deep South before the Civil War, and he was a well-known expert on what was then called "Negro medicine."
He promoted the racial concept of disease, that people of different races suffer from different diseases and experience common diseases differently.
Cartwright argued in the 1850s that slavery was beneficial for black people for medical reasons.
He claimed that because black people have lower lung capacity than whites, forced labor was good for them.
He wrote in a medical journal, "It is the red vital blood sent to the brain that liberates their minds when under the white man's control, and it is the want of sufficiency of red vital blood that chains their minds to ignorance and barbarism when in freedom."
To support this theory, Cartwright helped to perfect a medical device for measuring breathing called the spirometer to show the presumed deficiency in black people's lungs.
Today, doctors still uphold Cartwright's claim the black people as a race have lower lung capacity than white people.
Some even use a modern day spirometer that actually has a button labeled "race" so the machine adjusts the measurement for each patient according to his or her race.
It's a well-known function called "correcting for race."
The problem with race medicine extends far beyond misdiagnosing patients.
Its focus on innate racial differences in disease diverts attention and resources from the social determinants that cause appalling racial gaps in health: lack of access to high-quality medical care; food deserts in poor neighborhoods; exposure to environmental toxins; high rates of incarceration; and experiencing the stress of racial discrimination.
You see, race is not a biological category that naturally produces these health disparities because of genetic difference.
Race is a social category that has staggering biological consequences, but because of the impact of social inequality on people's health.
Yet race medicine pretends the answer to these gaps in health can be found in a race-specific pill.
It's much easier and more lucrative to market a technological fix for these gaps in health than to deal with the structural inequities that produce them.
The reason I'm so passionate about ending race medicine isn't just because it's bad medicine.
I'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to promote a false and toxic view of humanity.
Despite the many visionary breakthroughs in medicine we've been learning about, there's a failure of imagination when it comes to race.
Would you imagine with me, just a moment: What would happen if doctors stopped treating patients by race?
Suppose they rejected an 18th-century classification system and incorporated instead the most advanced knowledge of human genetic diversity and unity, that human beings cannot be categorized into biological races?
What if, instead of using race as a crude proxy for some more important factor, doctors actually investigated and addressed that more important factor?
What if doctors joined the forefront of a movement to end the structural inequities caused by racism, not by genetic difference?
Race medicine is bad medicine, it's poor science and it's a false interpretation of humanity.
It is more urgent than ever to finally abandon this backward legacy and to affirm our common humanity by ending the social inequalities that truly divide us.
Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you. Thanks.
Thank you.
Before he turned physics upside down, a young Albert Einstein supposedly showed off his genius by devising a complex riddle involving this list of clues.
Can you resist tackling a brain teaser written by one of the smartest people in history?
Let's give it a shot.
The world's rarest fish has been stolen from the city aquarium.
The police have followed the scent to a street with five identical looking houses.
But they can't search all the houses at once, and if they pick the wrong one, the thief will know they're on his trail.
It's up to you, the city's best detective, to solve the case.
When you arrive on the scene, the police tell you what they know.
One: each house's owner is of a different nationality, drinks a different beverage, and smokes a different type of cigar.
Two: each house's interior walls are painted a different color.
Three: each house contains a different animal, one of which is the fish.
After a few hours of expert sleuthing, you gather some clues.
It may look like a lot of information, but there's a clear logical path to the solution.
Solving the puzzle will be a lot like Sudoku, so you may find it helpful to organize your information in a grid, like this.
Pause the video on the following screen to examine your clues and solve the riddle.
Answer in: 3 2 1 To start, you fill in the information from clues eight and nine.
Immediately, you also realize that since the Norwegian is at the end of the street, there's only one house next to him, which must be the one with the blue walls in clue fourteen.
Clue five says the green-walled house's owner drinks coffee.
It can't be the center house since you already know its owner drinks milk, but it also can't be the second house, which you know has blue walls.
And since clue four says the green-walled house must be directly to the left of the white-walled one, it can't be the first or fifth house either.
The only place left for the green-walled house with the coffee drinker is the fourth spot, meaning the white-walled house is the fifth.
Clue one gives you a nationality and a color.
Since the only column missing both these values is the center one, this must be the Brit's red-walled home.
Now that the only unassigned wall color is yellow, this must be applied to the first house, where clue seven says the Dunhill smoker lives.
And clue eleven tells you that the owner of the horse is next door, which can only be the second house.
The next step is to figure out what the Norwegian in the first house drinks.
It can't be tea, clue three tells you that's the Dane.
As per clue twelve, it can't be root beer since that person smokes Bluemaster, and since you already assigned milk and coffee, it must be water.
From clue fifteen, you know that the Norwegian's neighbor, who can only be in the second house, smokes Blends.
Now that the only spot in the grid without a cigar and a drink is in the fifth column, that must be the home of the person in clue twelve.
And since this leaves only the second house without a drink, the tea-drinking Dane must live there.
The fourth house is now the only one missing a nationality and a cigar brand, so the Prince-smoking German from clue thirteen must live there.
Through elimination, you can conclude that the Brit smokes Pall Mall and the Swede lives in the fifth house, while clue six and clue two tell you that these two have a bird and a dog, respectively.
Clue ten tells you that the cat owner lives next to the Blend-smoking Dane, putting him in the first house.
Now with only one spot left on the grid, you know that the German in the green-walled house must be the culprit.
You and the police burst into the house, catching the thief fish-handed.
While that explanation was straightforward, solving puzzles like this often involves false starts and dead ends.
Part of the trick is to use the process of elimination and lots of trial and error to hone in on the right pieces, and the more logic puzzles you solve, the better your intuition will be for when and where there's enough information to make your deductions.
And did young Einstein really write this puzzle?
Probably not.
There's no evidence he did, and some of the brands mentioned are too recent.
But the logic here is not so different from what you'd use to solve equations with multiple variables, even those describing the nature of the universe.
What could octopuses possibly have in common with us?
After all, they don't have lungs, spines, or even a plural noun we can all agree on.
But what they do have is the ability to solve puzzles, learn through observation, and even use tools, just like some other animals we know.
And what makes octopus intelligence so amazing is that it comes from a biological structure completely different from ours.
The 200 or so species of octopuses are mollusks belonging to the order cephalopoda, Greek for head-feet.
Those heads contain impressively large brains, with a brain to body ratio similar to that of other intelligent animals, and a complex nervous system with about as many neurons as that of a dog.
But instead of being centralized in the brain, these 500 million neurons are spread out in a network of interconnected ganglia organized into three basic structures.
The central brain only contains about 10% of the neurons, while the two huge optic lobes contain about 30%.
The other 60% are in the tentacles, which for humans would be like our arms having minds of their own.
This is where things get even more interesting.
Vertebrates like us have a rigid skeleton to support our bodies, with joints that allow us to move.
But not all types of movement are allowed.
You can't bend your knee backwards, or bend your forearm in the middle, for example.
Cephalopods, on the other hand, have no bones at all, allowing them to bend their limbs at any point and in any direction.
So shaping their tentacles into any one of the virtually limitless number of possible arrangements is unlike anything we are used to.
Consider a simple task, like grabbing and eating an apple.
The human brain contains a neurological map of our body.
When you see the apple, your brain's motor center activates the appropriate muscles, allowing you to reach out with your arm, grab it with your hand, bend your elbow joint, and bring it to your mouth.
For an octopus, the process is quite different.
Rather than a body map, the cephalopod brain has a behavior library.
So when an octopus sees food, its brain doesn't activate a specific body part, but rather a behavioral response to grab.
As the signal travels through the network, the arm neurons pick up the message and jump into action to command the movement.
As soon as the arm touches the food, a muscle activation wave travels all the way through the arm to its base, while the arm sends back another wave from the base to the tip.
The signals meet halfway between the food and the base of the arm, letting it know to bend at that spot.
What all this means is that each of an octopus's eight arms can essentially think for itself.
This gives it amazing flexibility and creativity when facing a new situation or problem, whether its opening a bottle to reach food, escaping through a maze, moving around in a new environment, changing the texture and the color of its skin to blend into the scenery, or even mimicking other creatures to scare away enemies.
Cephalopods may have evolved complex brains long before our vertebrate relatives.
And octopus intelligence isn't just useful for octopuses.
Their radically different nervous system and autonomously thinking appendages have inspired new research in developing flexible robots made of soft materials.
And studying how intelligence can arise along such a divergent evolutionary path can help us understand more about intelligence and consciousness in general.
Who knows what other forms of intelligent life are possible, or how they process the world around them.
In the third millenium BCE, Mesopotamian kings recorded and interpreted their dreams on wax tablets.
A thousand years later, Ancient Egyptians wrote a dream book listing over a hundred common dreams and their meanings.
And in the years since, we haven't paused in our quest to understand why we dream.
So, after a great deal of scientific research, technological advancement, and persistence, we still don't have any definite answers, but we have some interesting theories.
We dream to fulfill our wishes.
In the early 1900s, Sigmund Freud proposed that while all of our dreams, including our nightmares, are a collection of images from our daily conscious lives, they also have symbolic meanings, which relate to the fulfillment of our subconscious wishes.
Freud theorized that everything we remember when we wake up from a dream is a symbolic representation of our unconscious primitive thoughts, urges, and desires.
Freud believed that by analyzing those remembered elements, the unconscious content would be revealed to our conscious mind, and psychological issues stemming from its repression could be addressed and resolved.
We dream to remember.
To increase performance on certain mental tasks, sleep is good, but dreaming while sleeping is better.
In 2010, researchers found that subjects were much better at getting through a complex 3-D maze if they had napped and dreamed of the maze prior to their second attempt.
In fact, they were up to ten times better at it than those who only thought of the maze while awake between attempts, and those who napped but did not dream about the maze.
Researchers theorize that certain memory processes can happen only when we are asleep, and our dreams are a signal that these processes are taking place.
We dream to forget.
There are about 10,000 trillion neural connections within the architecture of your brain.
They are created by everything you think and everything you do.
A 1983 neurobiological theory of dreaming, called reverse learning, holds that while sleeping, and mainly during REM sleep cycles, your neocortex reviews these neural connections and dumps the unnecessary ones.
Without this unlearning process, which results in your dreams, your brain could be overrun by useless connections and parasitic thoughts could disrupt the necessary thinking you need to do while you're awake.
We dream to keep our brains working.
The continual activation theory proposes that your dreams result from your brain's need to constantly consolidate and create long-term memories in order to function properly.
So when external input falls below a certain level, like when you're asleep, your brain automatically triggers the generation of data from its memory storages, which appear to you in the form of the thoughts and feelings you experience in your dreams.
In other words, your dreams might be a random screen saver your brain turns on so it doesn't completely shut down.
We dream to rehearse.
Dreams involving dangerous and threatening situations are very common, and the primitive instinct rehearsal theory holds that the content of a dream is significant to its purpose.
Whether it's an anxiety-filled night of being chased through the woods by a bear or fighting off a ninja in a dark alley, these dreams allow you to practice your fight or flight instincts and keep them sharp and dependable in case you'll need them in real life.
But it doesn't always have to be unpleasant.
For instance, dreams about your attractive neighbor could actually give your reproductive instinct some practice, too.
We dream to heal.
Stress neurotransmitters in the brain are much less active during the REM stage of sleep, even during dreams of traumatic experiences, leading some researchers to theorize that one purpose of dreaming is to take the edge off painful experiences to allow for psychological healing.
Reviewing traumatic events in your dreams with less mental stress may grant you a clearer perspective and enhanced ability to process them in psychologically healthy ways.
People with certain mood disorders and PTSD often have difficulty sleeping, leading some scientists to believe that lack of dreaming may be a contributing factor to their illnesses.
We dream to solve problems.
Unconstrained by reality and the rules of conventional logic, in your dreams, your mind can create limitless scenarios to help you grasp problems and formulate solutions that you may not consider while awake.
John Steinbeck called it the committee of sleep, and research has demonstrated the effectiveness of dreaming on problem solving.
It's also how renowned chemist August Kekule discovered the structure of the benzene molecule, and it's the reason that sometimes the best solution for a problem is to sleep on it.
And those are just a few of the more prominent theories.
As technology increases our capability for understanding the brain, it's possible that one day we will discover the definitive reason for them.
But until that time arrives, we'll just have to keep on dreaming.
Depression is the leading cause of disability in the world.
In the United States, close to 10% of adults struggle with depression.
But because it's a mental illness, it can be a lot harder to understand than, say, high cholesterol.
One major source of confusion is the difference between having depression and just feeling depressed.
Almost everyone feels down from time to time.
Getting a bad grade, losing a job, having an argument, even a rainy day can bring on feelings of sadness.
Sometimes there's no trigger at all.
It just pops up out of the blue.
Then circumstances change, and those sad feelings disappear.
Clinical depression is different.
It's a medical disorder, and it won't go away just because you want it to.
It lingers for at least two consecutive weeks, and significantly interferes with one's ability to work, play, or love.
Depression can have a lot of different symptoms: a low mood, loss of interest in things you'd normally enjoy, changes in appetite, feeling worthless or excessively guilty, sleeping either too much or too little, poor concentration, restlessness or slowness, loss of energy, or recurrent thoughts of suicide.
If you have at least five of those symptoms, according to psychiatric guidelines, you qualify for a diagnosis of depression.
And it's not just behavioral symptoms.
Depression has physical manifestations inside the brain.
First of all, there are changes that could be seen with the naked eye and X-ray vision.
These include smaller frontal lobes and hippocampal volumes.
On a more microscale, depression is associated with a few things: the abnormal transmission or depletion of certain neurotransmitters, especially serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, blunted circadian rhythms, or specific changes in the REM and slow-wave parts of your sleep cycle, and hormone abnormalities, such as high cortisol and deregulation of thyroid hormones.
But neuroscientists still don't have a complete picture of what causes depression.
It seems to have to do with a complex interaction between genes and environment, but we don't have a diagnostic tool that can accurately predict where or when it will show up.
And because depression symptoms are intangible, it's hard to know who might look fine but is actually struggling.
According to the National Institute of Mental Health, it takes the average person suffering with a mental illness over ten years to ask for help.
But there are very effective treatments.
Medications and therapy complement each other to boost brain chemicals.
In extreme cases, electroconvulsive therapy, which is like a controlled seizure in the patient's brain, is also very helpful.
Other promising treatments, like transcranial magnetic stimulation, are being investigated, too.
So, if you know someone struggling with depression, encourage them, gently, to seek out some of these options.
You might even offer to help with specific tasks, like looking up therapists in the area, or making a list of questions to ask a doctor.
To someone with depression, these first steps can seem insurmountable.
If they feel guilty or ashamed, point out that depression is a medical condition, just like asthma or diabetes.
It's not a weakness or a personality trait, and they shouldn't expect themselves to just get over it anymore than they could will themselves to get over a broken arm.
If you haven't experienced depression yourself, avoid comparing it to times you've felt down.
Comparing what they're experiencing to normal, temporary feelings of sadness can make them feel guilty for struggling.
Even just talking about depression openly can help.
For example, research shows that asking someone about suicidal thoughts actually reduces their suicide risk.
Open conversations about mental illness help erode stigma and make it easier for people to ask for help.
And the more patients seek treatment, the more scientists will learn about depression, and the better the treatments will get.
So I'm a neurosurgeon.
And like most of my colleagues, I have to deal, every day, with human tragedies.
I realize how your life can change from one second to the other after a major stroke or after a car accident.
And what is very frustrating for us neurosurgeons is to realize that unlike other organs of the body, the brain has very little ability for self-repair.
And after a major injury of your central nervous system, the patients often remain with a severe handicap.
And that's probably the reason why I've chosen to be a functional neurosurgeon.
What is a functional neurosurgeon?
It's a doctor who is trying to improve a neurological function through different surgical strategies.
You've certainly heard of one of the famous ones called deep brain stimulation, where you implant an electrode in the depths of the brain in order to modulate a circuit of neurons to improve a neurological function.
It's really an amazing technology in that it has improved the destiny of patients with Parkinson's disease, with severe tremor, with severe pain.
However, neuromodulation does not mean neuro-repair.
And the dream of functional neurosurgeons is to repair the brain.
I think that we are approaching this dream.
And I would like to show you that we are very close to this.
And that with a little bit of help, the brain is able to help itself.
So the story started 15 years ago.
At that time, I was a chief resident working days and nights in the emergency room.
I often had to take care of patients with head trauma.
You have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma, his brain is swelling and he's increasing his intracranial pressure.
And in order to save his life, you have to decrease this intracranial pressure.
And to do that, you sometimes have to remove a piece of swollen brain.
So instead of throwing away these pieces of swollen brain, we decided with Jean-François Brunet, who is a colleague of mine, a biologist, to study them.
What do I mean by that?
We wanted to grow cells from these pieces of tissue.
It's not an easy task.
Growing cells from a piece of tissue is a bit the same as growing very small children out from their family.
So you need to find the right nutrients, the warmth, the humidity and all the nice environments to make them thrive.
So that's exactly what we had to do with these cells.
And after many attempts, Jean-François did it.
And that's what he saw under his microscope.
And that was, for us, a major surprise.
Why?
Because this looks exactly the same as a stem cell culture, with large green cells surrounding small, immature cells.
And you may remember from biology class that stem cells are immature cells, able to turn into any type of cell of the body.
The adult brain has stem cells, but they're very rare and they're located in deep and small niches in the depths of the brain.
So it was surprising to get this kind of stem cell culture from the superficial part of swollen brain we had in the operating theater.
And there was another intriguing observation: Regular stem cells are very active cells -- cells that divide, divide, divide very quickly.
And they never die, they're immortal cells.
But these cells behave differently.
They divide slowly, and after a few weeks of culture, they even died.
So we were in front of a strange new cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.
And it took us a long time to understand where they came from.
They come from these cells.
These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.
All of you have them in your brain.
They represent four percent of your cortical brain cells.
They have a very important role during the development stage.
When you were fetuses, they helped your brain to fold itself.
But why do they stay in your head?
This, we don't know.
We think that they may participate in brain repair because we find them in higher concentration close to brain lesions.
But it's not so sure.
But there is one clear thing -- that from these cells, we got our stem cell culture.
And we were in front of a potential new source of cells to repair the brain.
And we had to prove this.
So to prove it, we decided to design an experimental paradigm.
The idea was to biopsy a piece of brain in a non-eloquent area of the brain, and then to culture the cells exactly the way Jean-François did it in his lab.
And then label them, to put color in them in order to be able to track them in the brain.
And the last step was to re-implant them in the same individual.
We call these autologous grafts -- autografts.
So the first question we had, "What will happen if we re-implant these cells in a normal brain, and what will happen if we re-implant the same cells in a lesioned brain?"
Thanks to the help of professor Eric Rouiller, we worked with monkeys.
So in the first-case scenario, we re-implanted the cells in the normal brain and what we saw is that they completely disappeared after a few weeks, as if they were taken from the brain, they go back home, the space is already busy, they are not needed there, so they disappear.
In the second-case scenario, we performed the lesion, we re-implanted exactly the same cells, and in this case, the cells remained -- and they became mature neurons.
And that's the image of what we could observe under the microscope.
Those are the cells that were re-implanted.
And the proof they carry, these little spots, those are the cells that we've labeled in vitro, when they were in culture.
But we could not stop here, of course.
Do these cells also help a monkey to recover after a lesion?
So for that, we trained monkeys to perform a manual dexterity task.
They had to retrieve food pellets from a tray.
They were very good at it.
And when they had reached a plateau of performance, we did a lesion in the motor cortex corresponding to the hand motion.
So the monkeys were plegic, they could not move their hand anymore.
And exactly the same as humans would do, they spontaneously recovered to a certain extent, exactly the same as after a stroke.
Patients are completely plegic, and then they try to recover due to a brain plasticity mechanism, they recover to a certain extent, exactly the same for the monkey.
So when we were sure that the monkey had reached his plateau of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.
So on the left side, you see the monkey that has spontaneously recovered.
He's at about 40 to 50 percent of his previous performance before the lesion.
He's not so accurate, not so quick.
And look now when we re-implant the cells: Two months after re-implantation, the same individual.
(Applause) It was also very exciting results for us, I tell you.
Since that time, we've understood much more about these cells.
We know that we can cryopreserve them, we can use them later on.
We know that we can apply them in other neuropathological models, like Parkinson's disease, for example.
But our dream is still to implant them in humans.
And I really hope that I'll be able to show you soon that the human brain is giving us the tools to repair itself.
Thank you.
(Applause) Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is amazing, and I'm sure that right now, there are several dozen people in the audience, possibly even a majority, who are thinking, "I know somebody who can use this."
I do, in any case.
And of course the question is, what are the biggest obstacles before you can go into human clinical trials?
Jocelyne Bloch: The biggest obstacles are regulations. (Laughs) So, from these exciting results, you need to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to be able to go through these kind of trials.
BG: Which is understandable, the brain is delicate, etc.
JB: Yes, it is, but it takes a long time and a lot of patience and almost a professional team to do it, you know?
BG: If you project yourself -- having done the research and having tried to get permission to start the trials, if you project yourself out in time, how many years before somebody gets into a hospital and this therapy is available?
JB: So, it's very difficult to say.
It depends, first, on the approval of the trial.
Will the regulation allow us to do it soon?
And then, you have to perform this kind of study in a small group of patients.
So it takes, already, a long time to select the patients, do the treatment and evaluate if it's useful to do this kind of treatment.
And then you have to deploy this to a multicentric trial.
You have to really prove first that it's useful before offering this treatment up for everybody.
BG: And safe, of course. JB: Of course.
BG: Jocelyne, thank you for coming to TED and sharing this.
BG: Thank you.
(Applause)
Which of these has the least carbohydrates?
This roll of bread?
This bowl of rice?
Or this can of soda?
It's a trick question.
Although they may differ in fats, vitamins, and other nutritional content, when it comes to carbs, they're pretty much the same.
So what exactly does that mean for your diet?
First of all, carbohydrate is the nutritional category for sugars and molecules that your body breaks down to make sugars.
Carbohydrates can be simple or complex depending on their structure.
This is a simple sugar, or monosaccharide.
Glucose, fructose, and galactose are all simple sugars.
Link two of them together, and you've got a disaccharide, lactose, maltose, or sucrose.
Complex carbohydrates, on the other hand, have three or more simple sugars strung together.
Complex carbohydrates with three to ten linked sugars are oligosaccharides.
Those with more than ten are polysaccharides.
During digestion, your body breaks down those complex carbohydrates into their monosaccharide building blocks, which your cells can use for energy.
So when you eat any carbohydrate-rich food, the sugar level in your blood, normally about a teaspoon, goes up.
But your digestive tract doesn't respond to all carbohydrates the same.
Consider starch and fiber, both polysaccharides, both derived from plants, both composed of hundreds to thousands of monosaccharides joined together, but they're joined together differently, and that changes the effect they have on your body.
In starches, which plants mostly store for energy in roots and seeds, glucose molecules are joined together by alpha linkages, most of which can be easily cleaved by enzymes in your digestive tract.
But in fiber, the bonds between monosaccharide molecules are beta bonds, which your body can't break down.
Fiber can also trap some starches, preventing them from being cleaved, resulting in something called resistant starch.
So foods high in starch, like crackers and white bread, are digested easily, quickly releasing a whole bunch of glucose into your blood, exactly what would happen if you drank something high in glucose, like soda.
These foods have a high glycemic index, the amount that a particular food raises the sugar level in your blood.
Soda and white bread have a similar glycemic index because they have a similar effect on your blood sugar.
But when you eat foods high in fiber, like vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, those indigestible beta bonds slow the release of glucose into the blood.
Those foods have a lower glycemic index, and foods like eggs, cheese, and meats have the lowest glycemic index.
When sugar moves from the digestive tract to the blood stream, your body kicks into action to transfer it into your tissues where it can be processed and used for energy.
Insulin, a hormone synthesized in the pancreas, is one of the body's main tools for sugar management.
When you eat and your blood sugar rises, insulin is secreted into the blood.
It prompts your muscle and fat cells to let glucose in and jump starts the conversion of sugar to energy.
The degree to which a unit of insulin lowers the blood sugar helps us understand something called insulin sensitivity.
The more a given unit of insulin lowers blood sugar, the more sensitive you are to insulin.
If insulin sensitivity goes down, that's known as insulin resistance.
The pancreas still sends out insulin, but cells, especially muscle cells, are less and less responsive to it, so blood sugar fails to decrease, and blood insulin continues to rise.
Chronically consuming a lot of carbohydrates may lead to insulin resistance, and many scientists believe that insulin resistance leads to a serious condition called metabolic syndrome.
That involves a constellation of symptoms, including high blood sugar, increased waist circumference, and high blood pressure.
It increases the risk of developing conditions, like cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes.
And its prevalence is rapidly increasing all over the world.
As much as 32% of the population in the U.S. has metabolic syndrome.
So let's get back to your diet.
Whether your food tastes sweet or not, sugar is sugar, and too many carbs can be a problem.
So maybe you'll want to take a pass on that pasta sushi roll pita burrito donut burger sandwich.
Statistics are persuasive.
So much so that people, organizations, and whole countries base some of their most important decisions on organized data.
But there's a problem with that.
Any set of statistics might have something lurking inside it, something that can turn the results completely upside down.
For example, imagine you need to choose between two hospitals for an elderly relative's surgery.
Out of each hospital's last 1000 patient's, 900 survived at Hospital A, while only 800 survived at Hospital B.
So it looks like Hospital A is the better choice.
But before you make your decision, remember that not all patients arrive at the hospital with the same level of health.
And if we divide each hospital's last 1000 patients into those who arrived in good health and those who arrived in poor health, the picture starts to look very different.
Hospital A had only 100 patients who arrived in poor health, of which 30 survived.
But Hospital B had 400, and they were able to save 210.
So Hospital B is the better choice for patients who arrive at hospital in poor health, with a survival rate of 52.5%.
And what if your relative's health is good when she arrives at the hospital?
Strangely enough, Hospital B is still the better choice, with a survival rate of over 98%.
So how can Hospital A have a better overall survival rate if Hospital B has better survival rates for patients in each of the two groups?
What we've stumbled upon is a case of Simpson's paradox, where the same set of data can appear to show opposite trends depending on how it's grouped.
This often occurs when aggregated data hides a conditional variable, sometimes known as a lurking variable, which is a hidden additional factor that significantly influences results.
Here, the hidden factor is the relative proportion of patients who arrive in good or poor health.
Simpson's paradox isn't just a hypothetical scenario.
It pops up from time to time in the real world, sometimes in important contexts.
One study in the UK appeared to show that smokers had a higher survival rate than nonsmokers over a twenty-year time period.
That is, until dividing the participants by age group showed that the nonsmokers were significantly older on average, and thus, more likely to die during the trial period, precisely because they were living longer in general.
Here, the age groups are the lurking variable, and are vital to correctly interpret the data.
In another example, an analysis of Florida's death penalty cases seemed to reveal no racial disparity in sentencing between black and white defendants convicted of murder.
But dividing the cases by the race of the victim told a different story.
In either situation, black defendants were more likely to be sentenced to death.
The slightly higher overall sentencing rate for white defendants was due to the fact that cases with white victims were more likely to elicit a death sentence than cases where the victim was black, and most murders occurred between people of the same race.
So how do we avoid falling for the paradox?
Unfortunately, there's no one-size-fits-all answer.
Data can be grouped and divided in any number of ways, and overall numbers may sometimes give a more accurate picture than data divided into misleading or arbitrary categories.
All we can do is carefully study the actual situations the statistics describe and consider whether lurking variables may be present.
Otherwise, we leave ourselves vulnerable to those who would use data to manipulate others and promote their own agendas.
Symmetry is everywhere in nature, and we usually associate it with beauty: a perfectly shaped leaf, or a butterfly with intricate patterns mirrored on each wing.
But it turns out that asymmetry is pretty important, too, and more common than you might think, from crabs with one giant pincer claw to snail species whose shells' always coil in the same direction.
Some species of beans only climb up their trellises clockwise, others, only counterclockwise, and even though the human body looks pretty symmetrical on the outside, it's a different story on the inside.
Most of your vital organs are arranged asymmetrically.
The heart, stomach, spleen, and pancreas lie towards the left.
The gallbladder and most of your liver are on the right.
Even your lungs are different.
The left one has two lobes, and the right one has three.
The two sides of your brain look similar, but function differently.
Making sure this asymmetry is distributed the right way is critical.
If all your internal organs are flipped, a condition called situs inversus, it's often harmless.
But incomplete reversals can be fatal, especially if the heart is involved.
But where does this asymmetry come from, since a brand-new embryo looks identical on the right and left.
One theory focuses on a small pit on the embryo called a node.
The node is lined with tiny hairs called cilia, while tilt away from the head and whirl around rapidly, all in the same direction.
This synchronized rotation pushes fluid from the right side of the embryo to the left.
On the node's left-hand rim, other cilia sense this fluid flow and activate specific genes on the embryo's left side.
These genes direct the cells to make certain proteins, and in just a few hours, the right and left sides of the embryo are chemically different.
Even though they still look the same, these chemical differences are eventually translated into asymmetric organs.
Asymmetry shows up in the heart first.
It begins as a straight tube along the center of the embryo, but when the embryo is around three weeks old, the tube starts to bend into a c-shape and rotate towards the right side of the body.
It grows different structures on each side, eventually turning into the familiar asymmetric heart.
Meanwhile, the other major organs emerge from a central tube and grow towards their ultimate positions.
But some organisms, like pigs, don't have those embryonic cilia and still have asymmetric internal organs.
Could all cells be intrinsically asymmetric?
Probably.
Bacterial colonies grow lacy branches that all curl in the same direction, and human cells cultured inside a ring-shaped boundary tend to line up like the ridges on a cruller.
If we zoom in even more, we see that many of cells' basic building blocks, like nucleic acids, proteins, and sugars, are inherently asymmetric.
Proteins have complex asymmetric shapes, and those proteins control which way cells migrate and which way embryonic cilia twirl.
These biomolecules have a property called chirality, which means that a molecule and its mirror image aren't identical.
Like your right and left hands, they look the same, but trying to put your right in your left glove proves they're not.
This asymmetry at the molecular level is reflected in asymmetric cells, asymmetric embryos, and finally asymmetric organisms.
So while symmetry may be beautiful, asymmetry holds an allure of its own, found in its graceful whirls, its organized complexity, and its striking imperfections.
I have given the slide show that I gave here two years ago about 2,000 times.
I'm giving a short slide show this morning that I'm giving for the very first time, so -- well it's -- I don't want or need to raise the bar, I'm actually trying to lower the bar.
Because I've cobbled this together to try to meet the challenge of this session.
And I was reminded by Karen Armstrong's fantastic presentation that religion really properly understood is not about belief, but about behavior.
Perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism.
How dare we be optimistic?
Optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief, an intellectual posture.
As Mahatma Gandhi famously said, "You must become the change you wish to see in the world."
And the outcome about which we wish to be optimistic is not going to be created by the belief alone, except to the extent that the belief brings about new behavior. But the word "behavior" is also, I think, sometimes misunderstood in this context.
I'm a big advocate of changing the lightbulbs and buying hybrids, and Tipper and I put 33 solar panels on our house, and dug the geothermal wells, and did all of that other stuff.
But, as important as it is to change the lightbulbs, it is more important to change the laws.
And when we change our behavior in our daily lives, we sometimes leave out the citizenship part and the democracy part. In order to be optimistic about this, we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy.
In order to solve the climate crisis, we have to solve the democracy crisis.
And we have one.
I have been trying to tell this story for a long time.
I was reminded of that recently, by a woman who walked past the table I was sitting at, just staring at me as she walked past. She was in her 70s, looked like she had a kind face. I thought nothing of it until I saw from the corner of my eye she was walking from the opposite direction, also just staring at me. And so I said, "How do you do?"
And she said, "You know, if you dyed your hair black, you would look just like Al Gore." (Laughter) Many years ago, when I was a young congressman, I spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge of nuclear arms control -- the nuclear arms race.
And the military historians taught me, during that quest, that military conflicts are typically put into three categories: local battles, regional or theater wars, and the rare but all-important global, world war -- strategic conflicts.
And each level of conflict requires a different allocation of resources, a different approach, a different organizational model.
Environmental challenges fall into the same three categories, and most of what we think about are local environmental problems: air pollution, water pollution, hazardous waste dumps. But there are also regional environmental problems, like acid rain from the Midwest to the Northeast, and from Western Europe to the Arctic, and from the Midwest out the Mississippi into the dead zone of the Gulf of Mexico.
And there are lots of those. But the climate crisis is the rare but all-important global, or strategic, conflict.
Everything is affected. And we have to organize our response appropriately. We need a worldwide, global mobilization for renewable energy, conservation, efficiency and a global transition to a low-carbon economy.
We have work to do. And we can mobilize resources and political will. But the political will has to be mobilized, in order to mobilize the resources.
Let me show you these slides here.
I thought I would start with the logo. What's missing here, of course, is the North Polar ice cap.
Greenland remains. Twenty-eight years ago, this is what the polar ice cap -- the North Polar ice cap -- looked like at the end of the summer, at the fall equinox.
This last fall, I went to the Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado, and talked to the researchers here in Monterey at the Naval Postgraduate Laboratory.
This is what's happened in the last 28 years.
To put it in perspective, 2005 was the previous record.
Here's what happened last fall that has really unnerved the researchers.
The North Polar ice cap is the same size geographically -- doesn't look quite the same size -- but it is exactly the same size as the United States, minus an area roughly equal to the state of Arizona.
The amount that disappeared in 2005 was equivalent to everything east of the Mississippi.
The extra amount that disappeared last fall was equivalent to this much. It comes back in the winter, but not as permanent ice, as thin ice -- vulnerable. The amount remaining could be completely gone in summer in as little as five years.
That puts a lot of pressure on Greenland.
Already, around the Arctic Circle -- this is a famous village in Alaska. This is a town in Newfoundland. Antarctica. Latest studies from NASA.
The amount of a moderate-to-severe snow melting of an area equivalent to the size of California.
"They were the best of times, they were the worst of times": the most famous opening sentence in English literature. I want to share briefly a tale of two planets. Earth and Venus are exactly the same size. Earth's diameter is about 400 kilometers larger, but essentially the same size.
They have exactly the same amount of carbon.
But the difference is, on Earth, most of the carbon has been leeched over time out of the atmosphere, deposited in the ground as coal, oil, natural gas, etc. On Venus, most of it is in the atmosphere. The difference is that our temperature is 59 degrees on average. On Venus, it's 855. This is relevant to our current strategy of taking as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible, and putting it into the atmosphere.
It's not because Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
It's three times hotter than Mercury, which is right next to the Sun. Now, briefly, here's an image you've seen, as one of the only old images, but I show it because I want to briefly give you CSI: Climate.
The global scientific community says: man-made global warming pollution, put into the atmosphere, thickening this, is trapping more of the outgoing infrared.
You all know that. At the last IPCC summary, the scientists wanted to say, "How certain are you?" They wanted to answer that "99 percent."
The Chinese objected, and so the compromise was "more than 90 percent."
Now, the skeptics say, "Oh, wait a minute, this could be variations in this energy coming in from the sun." If that were true, the stratosphere would be heated as well as the lower atmosphere, if it's more coming in.
If it's more being trapped on the way out, then you would expect it to be warmer here and cooler here. Here is the lower atmosphere.
Here's the stratosphere: cooler.
CSI: Climate.
Now, here's the good news. Sixty-eight percent of Americans now believe that human activity is responsible for global warming. Sixty-nine percent believe that the Earth is heating up in a significant way. There has been progress, but here is the key: when given a list of challenges to confront, global warming is still listed at near the bottom.
What is missing is a sense of urgency.
If you agree with the factual analysis, but you don't feel the sense of urgency, where does that leave you?
Well, the Alliance for Climate Protection, which I head in conjunction with Current TV -- who did this pro bono -- did a worldwide contest to do commercials on how to communicate this.
This is the winner.
NBC -- I'll show all of the networks here -- the top journalists for NBC asked 956 questions in 2007 of the presidential candidates: two of them were about the climate crisis. ABC: 844 questions, two about the climate crisis.
Fox: two. CNN: two. CBS: zero.
From laughs to tears -- this is one of the older tobacco commercials.
So here's what we're doing.
This is gasoline consumption in all of these countries. And us.
But it's not just the developed nations.
The developing countries are now following us and accelerating their pace. And actually, their cumulative emissions this year are the equivalent to where we were in 1965. And they're catching up very dramatically. The total concentrations: by 2025, they will be essentially where we were in 1985.
If the wealthy countries were completely missing from the picture, we would still have this crisis.
But we have given to the developing countries the technologies and the ways of thinking that are creating the crisis. This is in Bolivia -- over thirty years.
This is peak fishing in a few seconds. The '60s.
'70s. '80s. '90s. We have to stop this. And the good news is that we can.
We have the technologies.
We have to have a unified view of how to go about this: the struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions, all has a single, very simple solution.
People say, "What's the solution?" Here it is.
Put a price on carbon. We need a CO2 tax, revenue neutral, to replace taxation on employment, which was invented by Bismarck -- and some things have changed since the 19th century.
In the poor world, we have to integrate the responses to poverty with the solutions to the climate crisis.
Plans to fight poverty in Uganda are mooted, if we do not solve the climate crisis.
But responses can actually make a huge difference in the poor countries. This is a proposal that has been talked about a lot in Europe.
This was from Nature magazine. These are concentrating solar, renewable energy plants, linked in a so-called "supergrid" to supply all of the electrical power to Europe, largely from developing countries -- high-voltage DC currents.
This is not pie in the sky; this can be done.
We need to do it for our own economy.
The latest figures show that the old model is not working. There are a lot of great investments that you can make. If you are investing in tar sands or shale oil, then you have a portfolio that is crammed with sub-prime carbon assets.
And it is based on an old model.
Junkies find veins in their toes when the ones in their arms and their legs collapse. Developing tar sands and coal shale is the equivalent. Here are just a few of the investments that I personally think make sense.
I have a stake in these, so I'll have a disclaimer there.
But geothermal, concentrating solar, advanced photovoltaics, efficiency and conservation.
You've seen this slide before, but there's a change.
The only two countries that didn't ratify -- and now there's only one. Australia had an election.
And there was a campaign in Australia that involved television and Internet and radio commercials to lift the sense of urgency for the people there.
And we trained 250 people to give the slide show in every town and village and city in Australia.
Lot of other things contributed to it, but the new Prime Minister announced that his very first priority would be to change Australia's position on Kyoto, and he has. Now, they came to an awareness partly because of the horrible drought that they have had.
This is Lake Lanier. My friend Heidi Cullen said that if we gave droughts names the way we give hurricanes names, we'd call the one in the southeast now Katrina, and we would say it's headed toward Atlanta.
We can't wait for the kind of drought Australia had to change our political culture.
Here's more good news. The cities supporting Kyoto in the U.S.
are up to 780 -- and I thought I saw one go by there, just to localize this -- which is good news.
Now, to close, we heard a couple of days ago about the value of making individual heroism so commonplace that it becomes banal or routine.
What we need is another hero generation. Those of us who are alive in the United States of America today especially, but also the rest of the world, have to somehow understand that history has presented us with a choice -- just as Jill [Bolte] Taylor was figuring out how to save her life while she was distracted by the amazing experience that she was going through.
We now have a culture of distraction.
But we have a planetary emergency.
And we have to find a way to create, in the generation of those alive today, a sense of generational mission.
I wish I could find the words to convey this.
This was another hero generation that brought democracy to the planet.
Another that ended slavery. And that gave women the right to vote.
We can do this. Don't tell me that we don't have the capacity to do it.
If we had just one week's worth of what we spend on the Iraq War, we could be well on the way to solving this challenge.
We have the capacity to do it.
One final point: I'm optimistic, because I believe we have the capacity, at moments of great challenge, to set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge that history is presenting to us.
Sometimes I hear people respond to the disturbing facts of the climate crisis by saying, "Oh, this is so terrible.
What a burden we have." I would like to ask you to reframe that. How many generations in all of human history have had the opportunity to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts?
A challenge that can pull from us more than we knew we could do? I think we ought to approach this challenge with a sense of profound joy and gratitude that we are the generation about which, a thousand years from now, philharmonic orchestras and poets and singers will celebrate by saying, they were the ones that found it within themselves to solve this crisis and lay the basis for a bright and optimistic human future.
Let's do that. Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: For so many people at TED, there is deep pain that basically a design issue on a voting form -- one bad design issue meant that your voice wasn't being heard like that in the last eight years in a position where you could make these things come true.
That hurts.
Al Gore: You have no idea. (Laughter) CA: When you look at what the leading candidates in your own party are doing now -- I mean, there's -- are you excited by their plans on global warming?
AG: The answer to the question is hard for me because, on the one hand, I think that we should feel really great about the fact that the Republican nominee -- certain nominee -- John McCain, and both of the finalists for the Democratic nomination -- all three have a very different and forward-leaning position on the climate crisis. All three have offered leadership, and all three are very different from the approach taken by the current administration. And I think that all three have also been responsible in putting forward plans and proposals. But the campaign dialogue that -- as illustrated by the questions -- that was put together by the League of Conservation Voters, by the way, the analysis of all the questions -- and, by the way, the debates have all been sponsored by something that goes by the Orwellian label, "Clean Coal." Has anybody noticed that?
Every single debate has been sponsored by "Clean Coal."
"Now, even lower emissions!"
The richness and fullness of the dialogue in our democracy has not laid the basis for the kind of bold initiative that is really needed.
So they're saying the right things and they may -- whichever of them is elected -- may do the right thing, but let me tell you: when I came back from Kyoto in 1997, with a feeling of great happiness that we'd gotten that breakthrough there, and then confronted the United States Senate, only one out of 100 senators was willing to vote to confirm, to ratify that treaty. Whatever the candidates say has to be laid alongside what the people say.
This challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization.
CO2 is the exhaling breath of our civilization, literally.
And now we mechanized that process. Changing that pattern requires a scope, a scale, a speed of change that is beyond what we have done in the past.
So that's why I began by saying, be optimistic in what you do, but be an active citizen.
Demand -- change the light bulbs, but change the laws. Change the global treaties.
We have to speak up. We have to solve this democracy -- this -- We have sclerosis in our democracy. And we have to change that.
Use the Internet. Go on the Internet.
Connect with people. Become very active as citizens.
Have a moratorium -- we shouldn't have any new coal-fired generating plants that aren't able to capture and store CO2, which means we have to quickly build these renewable sources.
Now, nobody is talking on that scale. But I do believe that between now and November, it is possible.
This Alliance for Climate Protection is going to launch a nationwide campaign -- grassroots mobilization, television ads, Internet ads, radio, newspaper -- with partnerships with everybody from the Girl Scouts to the hunters and fishermen.
We need help. We need help.
CA: In terms of your own personal role going forward, Al, is there something more than that you would like to be doing?
AG: I have prayed that I would be able to find the answer to that question. What can I do?
Buckminster Fuller once wrote, "If the future of all human civilization depended on me, what would I do?
How would I be?" It does depend on all of us, but again, not just with the light bulbs.
We, most of us here, are Americans. We have a democracy.
We can change things, but we have to actively change.
What's needed really is a higher level of consciousness.
And that's hard to -- that's hard to create -- but it is coming.
There's an old African proverb that some of you know that says, "If you want to go quickly, go alone; if you want to go far, go together." We have to go far, quickly.
So we have to have a change in consciousness.
A change in commitment. A new sense of urgency.
A new appreciation for the privilege that we have of undertaking this challenge.
CA: Al Gore, thank you so much for coming to TED.
AG: Thank you. Thank you very much.
On January 26, 2013, a band of al-Qaeda militants entered the ancient city of Timbuktu on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert.
There, they set fire to a medieval library of 30,000 manuscripts written in Arabic and several African languages and ranging in subject from astronomy to geography, history to medicine, including one book which records perhaps the first treatment for male erectile dysfunction.
Unknown in the West, this was the collected wisdom of an entire continent, the voice of Africa at a time when Africa was thought not to have a voice at all.
The mayor of Bamako, who witnessed the event, called the burning of the manuscripts "a crime against world cultural heritage."
And he was right -- or he would have been, if it weren't for the fact that he was also lying.
In fact, just before, African scholars had collected a random assortment of old books and left them out for the terrorists to burn.
Today, the collection lies hidden in Bamako, the capital of Mali, moldering in the high humidity.
What was rescued by ruse is now once again in jeopardy, this time by climate.
But Africa, and the far-flung corners of the world, are not the only places, or even the main places in which manuscripts that could change the history of world culture are in jeopardy.
Several years ago, I conducted a survey of European research libraries and discovered that, at the barest minimum, there are 60,000 manuscripts pre-1500 that are illegible because of water damage, fading, mold and chemical reagents.
The real number is likely double that, and that doesn't even count Renaissance manuscripts and modern manuscripts and cultural heritage objects such as maps.
What if there were a technology that could recover these lost and unknown works?
Imagine worldwide how a trove of hundreds of thousands of previously unknown texts could radically transform our knowledge of the past.
Imagine what unknown classics we would discover which would rewrite the canons of literature, history, philosophy, music -- or, more provocatively, that could rewrite our cultural identities, building new bridges between people and culture.
These are the questions that transformed me from a medieval scholar, a reader of texts, into a textual scientist.
What an unsatisfying word "reader" is.
For me, it conjures up images of passivity, of someone sitting idly in an armchair waiting for knowledge to come to him in a neat little parcel.
How much better to be a participant in the past, an adventurer in an undiscovered country, searching for the hidden text.
As an academic, I was a mere reader.
I read and taught the same classics that people had been reading and teaching for hundreds of years -- Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer, Petrarch -- and with every scholarly article that I published I added to human knowledge in ever-diminishing slivers of insight.
What I wanted to be was an archaeologist of the past, a discoverer of literature, an Indiana Jones without the whip -- or, actually, with the whip.
(Laughter) And I wanted it not just for myself but I wanted it for my students as well.
And so six years ago, I changed the direction of my career.
At the time, I was working on "The Chess of Love," the last important long poem of the European Middle Ages never to have been edited.
And it wasn't edited because it existed in only one manuscript which was so badly damaged during the firebombing of Dresden in World War II that generations of scholars had pronounced it lost.
For five years, I had been working with an ultraviolet lamp trying to recover traces of the writing and I'd gone about as far as technology at the time could actually take me.
And so I did what many people do.
I went online, and there I learned about how multispectral imaging had been used to recover two lost treatises of the famed Greek mathematician Archimedes from a 13th-century palimpsest.
A palimpsest is a manuscript which has been erased and overwritten.
And so, out of the blue, I decided to write to the lead imaging scientist on the Archimedes palimpsest project, Professor Roger Easton, with a plan and a plea.
And to my surprise, he actually wrote back.
With his help, I was able to win a grant from the US government to build a transportable, multispectral imaging lab, And with this lab, I transformed what was a charred and faded mess into a new medieval classic.
So how does multispectral imaging actually work?
Well, the idea behind multispectral imaging is something that anyone who is familiar with infrared night vision goggles will immediately appreciate: that what we can see in the visible spectrum of light is only a tiny fraction of what's actually there.
The same is true with invisible writing.
Our system uses 12 wavelengths of light between the ultraviolet and the infrared, and these are shown down onto the manuscript from above from banks of LEDs, and another multispectral light source which comes up through the individual leaves of the manuscript.
Up to 35 images per sequence per leaf are imaged this way using a high-powered digital camera equipped with a lens which is made out of quartz.
There are about five of these in the world.
And once we capture these images, we feed them through statistical algorithms to further enhance and clarify them, using software which was originally designed for satellite images and used by people like geospatial scientists and the CIA.
The results can be spectacular.
You may already have heard of what's been done for the Dead Sea Scrolls, which are slowly gelatinizing.
Using infrared, we've been able to read even the darkest corners of the Dead Sea Scrolls.
You may not be aware, however, of other Biblical texts that are in jeopardy.
Here, for example, is a leaf from a manuscript that we imaged, which is perhaps the most valuable Christian Bible in the world.
The Codex Vercellensis is the oldest translation of the Gospels into Latin, and it dates from the first half of the fourth century.
This is the closest we can come to the Bible at the time of the foundation of Christendom under Emperor Constantine, and at the time also of the Council of Nicaea, when the basic creed of Christianity was being agreed upon.
This manuscript, unfortunately, has been very badly damaged, and it's damaged because for centuries it had been used and handled in swearing in ceremonies in the church.
In fact, that purple splotch that you see in the upper left hand corner is Aspergillus, which is a fungus which originates in the unwashed hands of a person with tuberculosis.
Our imaging has enabled me to make the first transcription of this manuscript in 250 years.
Having a lab that can travel to collections where it's needed, however, is only part of the solution.
The technology is expensive and very rare, and the imaging and image processing skills are esoteric.
That means that mounting recoveries is beyond the reach of most researchers and all but the wealthiest institutions.
That's why I founded the Lazarus Project, a not-for-profit initiative to bring multispectral imaging to individual researchers and smaller institutions at little or no cost whatsoever.
Over the past five years, our team of imaging scientists, scholars and students has travelled to seven different countries and have recovered some of the world's most valuable damaged manuscripts, included the Vercelli Book, which is the oldest book of English, the Black Book of Carmarthen, the oldest book of Welsh, and some of the most valuable earliest Gospels located in what is now the former Soviet Georgia.
So, spectral imaging can recover lost texts.
More subtly, though, it can recover a second story behind every object, the story of how, when and by whom a text was created, and, sometimes, what the author was thinking at the time he wrote.
Take, for example, a draft of the Declaration of Independence written in Thomas Jefferson's own hand, which some colleagues of mine imaged a few years ago at the Library of Congress.
Curators had noticed that one word throughout had been scratched out and overwritten.
The word overwritten was "citizens."
Perhaps you can guess what the word underneath was.
"Subjects."
There, ladies and gentlemen, is American democracy evolving under the hand of Thomas Jefferson.
Or consider the 1491 Martellus Map, which we imaged at Yale's Beinecke Library.
This was the map that Columbus likely consulted before he traveled to the New World and which gave him his idea of what Asia looked like and where Japan was located.
The problem with this map is that its inks and pigments had so degraded over time that this large, nearly seven-foot map, made the world look like a giant desert.
Until now, we had very little idea, detailed idea, that is, of what Columbus knew of the world and how world cultures were represented.
The main legend of the map was entirely illegible under normal light.
Ultraviolet did very little for it.
Multispectral gave us everything.
In Asia, we learned of monsters with ears so long that they could cover the creature's entire body.
In Africa, about a snake who could cause the ground to smoke.
Like starlight, which can convey images of the way the Universe looked in the distant past, so multispectral light can take us back to the first stuttering moments of an object's creation.
Through this lens, we witness the mistakes, the changes of mind, the naïvetés, the uncensored thoughts, the imperfections of the human imagination that allow these hallowed objects and their authors to become more real, that make history closer to us.
What about the future?
There's so much of the past, and so few people with the skills to rescue it before these objects disappear forever.
That's why I have begun to teach this new hybrid discipline that I call "textual science."
Textual science is a marriage of the traditional skills of a literary scholar -- the ability to read old languages and old handwriting, the knowledge of how texts are made in order to be able to place and date them -- with new techniques like imaging science, the chemistry of inks and pigments, computer-aided optical character recognition.
Last year, a student in my class, a freshman, with a background in Latin and Greek, was image-processing a palimpsest that we had photographed at a famous library in Rome.
As he worked, tiny Greek writing began to appear from behind the text.
Everyone gathered around, and he read a line from a lost work of the Greek comic dramatist Menander.
This was the first time in well over a thousand years that those words had been pronounced aloud.
In that moment, he became a scholar.
Ladies and gentlemen, that is the future of the past.
Thank you very much.

You've found the hidden switches, evaded the secret traps, and now your expedition finally stands at the heart of the ancient temple inside The Lost City.
But as you study the inscriptions in the near total darkness, two of the eight graduate students accompanying you bump into the alter.
Suddenly, two whisps of green smoke burst forth and the walls begin to shake.
Fleeing for your lives, you come to a room you passed before with five hallways, including the one to the altar and the one leading back outside.
The giant sandglass in the center is now flowing, with less than an hour before it empties, and the rumbling tells you that you don't want to be around when that happens.
From what you recall of your way here, it would take about 20 minutes to reach the exit at a fast pace.
You know this is the last junction before the exit, but your trail markings have been erased, and no one remembers the way.
If nine of you split up, there should be just enough time for each group to explore one of the four halls ahead and report back to this room, with everyone then making a run down the correct path.
There's just one problem; the inscriptions told of the altar's curse: the spirits of the city's King and Queen possessing intruders and leading them to their doom through deception.
Remembering the green smoke, you realize two of the students have been cursed.
At any time, one or both of them might lie, though they also might tell the truth.
You know for sure that the curse didn't get you, but you don't know which students can't be trusted, and because the possessed students may lie only occasionally, there is no guaranteed way to test them to determine which are cursed.
Can you figure out a way to ensure that you all escape?
Don't worry about the possessed students attacking or otherwise harming the others.
This curse only affects their communication.
Pause the video now if you want to figure it out by yourself!
Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 The first thing to realize is that since you know you aren't possessed, you can explore one of the halls alone.
This leaves eight students for the remaining three paths.
Sending groups of four down just two of the paths won't work because if one group came back split two versus two, you'd have to guess who to trust.
But splitting them into one pair and two trios would work every time, and here's why.
The possessed students might lie, or they might not, but you know there are only two of them, while the other six will always tell the truth.
When each group returns to the hall, all of its members will either give the same report or argue about whether they found the exit.
If a trio returns in total agreement, then you know none of them are lying.
With the pair, you can't be sure either way, but all you need is reliable evidence about three of the four paths.
The fourth you can figure out using the process of elimination.
Of course, none of this matters if you're lucky enough to find the exit yourself, but otherwise, putting everything together leaves you with three possibilities.
If each group gives a consistent answer, either everyone is telling the truth, or the two possessed students are paired together.
In either case, ignore the duo.
If there's only one group arguing, both others must be telling the truth, and if there are two conflicts, then the possessed students are in separate groups and you can safely trust the majority in both trios since at least two people in each will be truthful.
The temple collapses behind you as greenish vapors escape from two of the students.
You're all safe and free from the curse.
After that ordeal, you tell your group they all deserve a vacation, and you just happen to have another expedition coming up.
After the French Revolution erupted in 1789, Europe was thrown into chaos.
Neighboring countries' monarchs feared they would share the fate of Louis XVI, and attacked the New Republic, while at home, extremism and mistrust between factions lead to bloodshed.
In the midst of all this conflict, a powerful figure emerged to take charge of France.
But did he save the revolution or destroy it?
"Order, order, who's the defendant today? I don't see anyone."
"Your Honor, this is Napoléon Bonaparte, the tyrant who invaded nearly all of Europe to compensate for his personal stature-based insecurities."
"Actually, Napoléon was at least average height for his time.
The idea that he was short comes only from British wartime propaganda.
And he was no tyrant.
He was safeguarding the young Republic from being crushed by the European monarchies."
"By overthrowing its government and seizing power himself?"
"Your Honor, as a young and successful military officer, Napoléon fully supported the French Revolution, and its ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity.
But the revolutionaries were incapable of real leadership.
Robespierre and the Jacobins who first came to power unleashed a reign of terror on the population, with their anti-Catholic extremism and nonstop executions of everyone who disagreed with them.
And The Directory that replaced them was an unstable and incompetent oligarchy.
They needed a strong leader who could govern wisely and justly."
"So, France went through that whole revolution just to end up with another all-powerful ruler?"
"Not quite.
Napoléon's new powers were derived from the constitution that was approved by a popular vote in the Consulate."
"Ha! The constitution was practically dictated at gunpoint in a military coup, and the public only accepted the tyrant because they were tired of constant civil war."
"Be that as it may, Napoléon introduced a new constitution and a legal code that kept some of the most important achievements of the revolution in tact: freedom of religion abolition of hereditary privilege, and equality before the law for all men."
"All men, indeed.
He deprived women of the rights that the revolution had given them and even reinstated slavery in the French colonies.
Haiti is still recovering from the consequences centuries later.
What kind of equality is that?"
"The only kind that could be stably maintained at the time, and still far ahead of France's neighbors."
"Speaking of neighbors, what was with all the invasions?"
"Great question, Your Honor."
"Which invasions are we talking about?
It was the neighboring empires who had invaded France trying to restore the monarchy, and prevent the spread of liberty across Europe, twice by the time Napoléon took charge.
Having defended France as a soldier and a general in those wars, he knew that the best defense is a good offense."
"An offense against the entire continent?
Peace was secured by 1802, and other European powers recognized the new French Regime.
But Bonaparte couldn't rest unless he had control of the whole continent, and all he knew was fighting.
He tried to enforce a European-wide blockade of Britain, invaded any country that didn't comply, and launched more wars to hold onto his gains.
And what was the result?
Millions dead all over the continent, and the whole international order shattered."
"You forgot the other result: the spread of democratic and liberal ideals across Europe.
It was thanks to Napoléon that the continent was reshaped from a chaotic patchwork of fragmented feudal and religious territories into efficient, modern, and secular nation states where the people held more power and rights than ever before."
"Should we also thank him for the rise of nationalism and the massive increase in army sizes?
You can see how well that turned out a century later."
"So what would European history have been like if it weren't for Napoléon?"
"Unimaginably better/worse."
Napoléon seemingly unstoppable momentum would die in the Russian winter snows, along with most of his army.
But even after being deposed and exiled, he refused to give up, escaping from his prison and launching a bold attempt at restoring his empire before being defeated for the second and final time.
Bonaparte was a ruler full of contradictions, defending a popular revolution by imposing absolute dictatorship, and spreading liberal ideals through imperial wars, and though he never achieved his dream of conquering Europe, he undoubtedly left his mark on it, for better or for worse.
Ah, romantic love - beautiful and intoxicating, heartbreaking and soul-crushing, often all at the same time.
Why do we choose to put ourselves through its emotional wringer?
Does love make our lives meaningful, or is it an escape from our loneliness and suffering?
Is love a disguise for our sexual desire, or a trick of biology to make us procreate?
Is it all we need?
Do we need it at all?
If romantic love has a purpose, neither science nor psychology has discovered it yet.
But over the course of history, some of our most respected philosophers have put forward some intriguing theories.
Love makes us whole, again.
The ancient Greek philosopher Plato explored the idea that we love in order to become complete.
In his "Symposium", he wrote about a dinner party, at which Aristophanes, a comic playwright, regales the guests with the following story: humans were once creatures with four arms, four legs, and two faces.
One day, they angered the gods, and Zeus sliced them all in two.
Since then, every person has been missing half of him or herself.
Love is the longing to find a soulmate who'll make us feel whole again, or, at least, that's what Plato believed a drunken comedian would say at a party.
Love tricks us into having babies.
Much, much later, German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer maintained that love based in sexual desire was a voluptuous illusion.
He suggested that we love because our desires lead us to believe that another person will make us happy, but we are sorely mistaken.
Nature is tricking us into procreating, and the loving fusion we seek is consummated in our children.
When our sexual desires are satisfied, we are thrown back into our tormented existences, and we succeed only in maintaining the species and perpetuating the cycle of human drudgery.
Sounds like somebody needs a hug.
Love is escape from our loneliness.
According to the Nobel Prize-winning British philosopher Bertrand Russell, we love in order to quench our physical and psychological desires.
Humans are designed to procreate, but without the ecstasy of passionate love, sex is unsatisfying.
Our fear of the cold, cruel world tempts us to build hard shells to protect and isolate ourselves.
Love's delight, intimacy, and warmth helps us overcome our fear of the world, escape our lonely shells, and engage more abundantly in life.
Love enriches our whole being, making it the best thing in life.
Love is a misleading affliction.
Siddhārtha Gautama, who became known as the Buddha, or the Enlightened One, probably would have had some interesting arguments with Russell.
Buddha proposed that we love because we are trying to satisfy our base desires.
Yet, our passionate cravings are defects, and attachments, even romantic love, are a great source of suffering.
Luckily, Buddha discovered the eight-fold path, a sort of program for extinguishing the fires of desire so that we can reach Nirvana, an enlightened state of peace, clarity, wisdom, and compassion.
The novelist Cao Xueqin illustrated this Buddhist sentiment that romantic love is folly in one of China's greatest classical novels, "Dream of the Red Chamber."
In a subplot, Jia Rui falls in love with Xi-feng who tricks and humiliates him.
Conflicting emotions of love and hate tear him apart, so a Taoist gives him a magic mirror that can cure him as long as he doesn't look at the front of it.
But of course, he looks at the front of it.
He sees Xi-feng.
His soul enters the mirror and he is dragged away in iron chains to die.
Not all Buddhists think this way about romantic and erotic love, but the moral of this story is that such attachments spell tragedy, and should, along with magic mirrors, be avoided.
Love lets us reach beyond ourselves.
Let's end on a slightly more positive note.
The French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir proposed that love is the desire to integrate with another and that it infuses our lives with meaning.
However, she was less concerned with why we love and more interested in how we can love better.
She saw that the problem with traditional romantic love is it can be so captivating, that we are tempted to make it our only reason for being.
Yet, dependence on another to justify our existence easily leads to boredom and power games.
To avoid this trap, Beauvoir advised loving authentically, which is more like a great friendship.
Lovers support each other in discovering themselves, reaching beyond themselves, and enriching their lives and the world together.
Though we might never know why we fall in love, we can be certain that it will be an emotional rollercoaster ride.
It's scary and exhilarating.
It makes us suffer and makes us soar.
Maybe we lose ourselves.
Maybe we find ourselves.
It might be heartbreaking, or it might just be the best thing in life.
Will you dare to find out?
Have you ever talked with a friend about a problem only to realize that he just doesn't seem to grasp why the issue is so important to you?
Have you ever presented an idea to a group and it's met with utter confusion?
Or maybe you've been in an argument when the other person suddenly accuses you of not listening to what they're saying at all?
What's going on here?
The answer is miscommunication, and in some form or another, we've all experienced it.
It can lead to confusion, animosity, misunderstanding, or even crashing a multimillion dollar probe into the surface of Mars.
The fact is even when face-to-face with another person, in the very same room, and speaking the same language, human communication is incredibly complex.
But the good news is that a basic understanding of what happens when we communicate can help us prevent miscommunication.
For decades, researchers have asked, "What happens when we communicate?"
One interpretation, called the transmission model, views communication as a message that moves directly from one person to another, similar to someone tossing a ball and walking away.
But in reality, this simplistic model doesn't account for communication's complexity.
Enter the transactional model, which acknowledges the many added challenges of communicating.
With this model, it's more accurate to think of communication between people as a game of catch.
As we communicate our message, we receive feedback from the other party.
Through the transaction, we create meaning together.
But from this exchange, further complications arise.
It's not like the Star Trek universe, where some characters can Vulcan mind meld, fully sharing thoughts and feelings.
As humans, we can't help but send and receive messages through our own subjective lenses.
When communicating, one person expresses her interpretation of a message, and the person she's communicating with hears his own interpretation of that message.
Our perceptual filters continually shift meanings and interpretations.
Remember that game of catch?
Imagine it with a lump of clay.
As each person touches it, they shape it to fit their own unique perceptions based on any number of variables, like knowledge or past experience, age, race, gender, ethnicity, religion, or family background.
Simultaneously, every person interprets the message they receive based on their relationship with the other person, and their unique understanding of the semantics and connotations of the exact words being used.
They could also be distracted by other stimuli, such as traffic or a growling stomach.
Even emotion might cloud their understanding, and by adding more people into a conversation, each with their own subjectivities, the complexity of communication grows exponentially.
So as the lump of clay goes back and forth from one person to another, reworked, reshaped, and always changing, it's no wonder our messages sometimes turn into a mush of miscommunication.
But, luckily, there are some simple practices that can help us all navigate our daily interactions for better communication.
One: recognize that passive hearing and active listening are not the same.
Engage actively with the verbal and nonverbal feedback of others, and adjust your message to facilitate greater understanding.
Two: listen with your eyes and ears, as well as with your gut.
Remember that communication is more than just words.
Three: take time to understand as you try to be understood.
In the rush to express ourselves, it's easy to forget that communication is a two-way street.
Be open to what the other person might say.
And finally, four: Be aware of your personal perceptual filters.
Elements of your experience, including your culture, community, and family, influence how you see the world.
Say, "This is how I see the problem, but how do you see it?"
Don't assume that your perception is the objective truth.
That'll help you work toward sharing a dialogue with others to reach a common understanding together.
I believe big institutions have unique potential to create change, and I believe that we as individuals have unique power to influence the direction that those institutions take.
Now, these beliefs did not come naturally to me, because trusting big institutions, not really part of my family legacy.
My mother escaped North Korea when she was 10 years old.
To do so, she had to elude every big institution in her life: repressive governments, occupying armies and even armed border patrols.
Later, when she decided she wanted to emigrate to the United States, she had to defy an entire culture that said the girls would never be the best and brightest.
Only because her name happens to sound like a boy's was she able to finagle her way into the government immigration exam to come to the United States.
Because of her bravery and passion, I've had all the opportunities that she never did, and that has made my story so different.
Instead of running away from big institutions, I've actually run toward them.
I've had the chance over the course of my career to work for The Wall Street Journal, the White House and now one of the largest financial institutions in the world, where I lead sustainable investing.
Now, these institutions are like tankers, and working inside of them, I've come to appreciate what large wakes they can leave, and I've become convinced that the institution of the global capital markets, the nearly 290 trillion dollars of stocks and bonds in the world, that that may be one of our most powerful forces for positive social change at our disposal, if we ask it to be.
Now, I know some of you are thinking, global capital markets, positive social change, not usually in the same sentence or even the same paragraph.
I think many people think of the capital markets kind of like an ocean.
It's a vast, impersonal, uncaring force of nature that is not affected by our wishes or desires.
So the best that our little savings accounts or retirement accounts can do is to try to catch some waves in the good cycles and hope that we don't get inundated in the turbulent ones, but certainly our decisions on how to steer our little retirement accounts don't affect the tides, don't change the shape or size or direction of the waves.
But why is that?
Because actually, one third of this ocean of capital actually belongs to individuals like us, and most of the rest of the capital markets is controlled by the institutions that get their power and authority and their capital from us, as members, participants, beneficiaries, shareholders or citizens.
So if we are the ultimate owners of the capital markets, why aren't we able to make our voices heard?
Why can't we make some waves?
So let me ask you a different question: did any of you buy fair trade coffee the last time you were at a supermarket or at Starbucks?
OK. Do any of you go to the restaurant and order the sustainably farmed trout instead of the miso-glazed Chilean sea bass that you really wish you could have?
Do any of you drive hybrid cars or even electric cars?
So why do we do these things?
Right? One electric car doesn't amount to much in a fleet of 1.2 billion combustion engine vehicles.
One fish is just one fish in the sea.
And one cup of coffee doesn't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.
But we do these things because we believe they matter, that our actions add up, that our choices might influence others and collectively, what an impact we can have.
So, in my bag I have a coffee mug that I bought a couple of years ago.
It's a reusable mug. It has all these things printed on it.
Look at some of the things that are on it, that it says.
"This one cup can be used again and again."
"This one cup may inspire others to use one too."
"This one cup helps save the planet."
I had no idea this plastic cup was so powerful.
(Laughter) So why do we think that our choice of a four dollar shade-grown fair trade artisanal cup of coffee in a reusable mug matters, but what we do with 4,000 dollars in our investment account for our IRA doesn't?
Why can't we tell the supermarket and the capital markets that we care, that we care about fair labor standards, that we care about sustainable production methods and about healthy communities?
Why aren't we voting with our investment dollars, but we would vote with our lattes?
So I think it has something to do with the myths, the fables that we all carry around in our collective consciousness.
Do you remember the Grimm's fairy tale about the magic porridge pot?
If you said to the pot, "Boil, little pot, boil," it would fill up with sweet porridge.
And if you said, "Stop, little pot, stop," it would stop.
But if you got the words wrong, it wouldn't listen, and things could go terribly awry.
So I think when it comes to markets, we have a little bit of a similar fable in our heads.
We believe that the markets is this magic pot that obeys only one command: make more money.
Only those words said exactly that way will make the pot fill up with gold.
Add in some extra words like "protect the environment," the spell might not work.
Put in the wrong words like "promote social justice," and you might see your gold coins shrink or even vanish entirely, according to this fable.
So we asked people, what do you really think?
And we actually went out and polled a thousand individual investors, and we found something fascinating.
Overwhelmingly, people wanted to add those extra words into the formula.
71 percent of people said yes, they were interested in sustainable investing, which we define as taking the best in class investment process that you already have traditionally and adding in the extra information you get when you think about the environment and society and good governance.
71 percent wanted that.
72 percent said that they believe that companies who did that would actually do better financially.
So people really do believe that you can do well by doing good.
But here was the weird thing: 54 percent of the people still said if they put their money in those kinds of stocks, they thought that they would make less money.
So is it true?
Do you get less sweet porridge if you invest in shade-grown coffee instead of drinking it?
Well, you know, the investors in companies like Burt's Bees or Ben &amp; Jerry's wouldn't say so.
Right? Both of those started out as small, socially conscious companies that ended up becoming so popular with consumers that the giants Unilever and Clorox bought them for hundreds of millions of dollars each.
But here's the important thing.
Those corporations realized that if they wanted to protect the value of their investments, they had to preserve that socially conscious mission.
If they didn't keep adding in those extra words of environmentally friendly and socially conscious, those brands wouldn't make more money.
But maybe this is just the exception the proves the rule, right?
The serious companies that fund our economy and that fund our retirements and that really make the world go round, they need to stick to making more money.
So, Harvard Business School actually researched this, and they found something fascinating.
If you had invested a dollar 20 years ago in a portfolio of companies that focused narrowly on making more money quarter by quarter, that one dollar would have grown to 14 dollars and 46 cents.
That's not bad until you consider that if instead you'd invested that same dollar in a portfolio of companies that focused on growing their business and on the most important environmental and social issues, that one dollar would have grown to 28 dollars and 36 cents.
almost twice as much sweet porridge.
Now, let's be clear, they didn't make that outperformance by giving away money to seem like a nice corporate citizen.
They did it by focusing on the things that matter to their business, like wasting less energy and water in their manufacturing processes; like making sure the CEO contracts had the CEOs incentivized for the long-term results of the company and the communities they served, not just quarterly results; or building a first class culture that would have higher employee loyalty, retention and productivity.
Now, Harvard's not alone.
Oxford also did a research study where they examined 120 different studies looking at the effect of sustainability and economic results, and they found time and time and time again that the companies that cared about these kinds of important things actually had better operational efficiency, lower cost of capital and better performance in their stock price.
And then there's Al Gore.
So 20 years ago, when I worked for Al Gore in the White House, he was one of the early pioneers pleading with businesses and governments to pay attention to the challenges of climate change.
Post-White House, he opened an investment firm called Generation, where he baked environmental sustainability and other things right into the core investment process.
And at the time there was a good bit of skepticism about his views.
Ten years later, his track record is one more proof point that sustainable investing done right can be sound investing.
Far from making less sweet porridge because he added sustainability into the mix, he actually significantly outperformed the benchmark.
Now, sustainable investing, the good news is it doesn't require a magic spell and it doesn't require some investment secret, and it's not just for the elite.
It is not just about private equity for billionaires.
It's not just groovy-sounding investments like clean technology or microfinance in emerging markets or artisanal bakeries in Brooklyn.
It's about stocks and bonds and Fortune 500 companies.
It's about mutual funds.
It's about all the things we already see in the market today.
So here's why I'm convinced that we collectively have the power to make sustainable investing the new normal.
First, the proof points are coming out all the time that sustainable investing done right, preserving all the same good principles of investing, the traditional sphere, can pay.
It makes sense.
Secondly, the biggest obstacle standing in our way may actually just be in our heads.
We just need to let go of that myth that if you add your values into your investment thinking, that you get less sweet porridge.
And once you get rid of the fable, you can actually start appreciating those facts we've been talking about.
And third, the future is already here.
Sustainable investment today is a 20 trillion dollar market and it's the fastest-growing segment of the investment industry.
In the United States, it has grown enormously, as you can see.
It now represents one out of every six dollars under professional management in the United States.
So what are we waiting for?
For me, it goes back to the inspiration that I received from my mother.
She knew that she wanted a life where she would have the freedom to make her own choices and to have her voice heard and write her own story.
She was passionate about that goal and she was clear that she would let no army, no obstacle, no big institution stand in her way.
She made it to the States, and she became a teacher, an award-winning author and a mother, and ended up sending her daughters to Harvard.
And these days, you can tell that she is amply comfortable holding court in the most powerful institutions in the world.
It seems almost too prophetic that her name in Korean means "passionate clarity."
Passionate clarity: that's what I think we need to drive change.
Passion about the change we want to see in the world, and clarity that we are able to help chart the course.
We have more opportunity today than ever before to make choices.
We have more power than ever before to make our voices heard.
So change your perspective.
Vote with your small change.
Invest in the change you want to see in the world.
Change the fables and change the markets.
Thank you.
(Applause)
When we hear the word radiation, it's tempting to picture huge explosions and frightening mutations, but that's not the full story.
Radiation also applies to rainbows and a doctor examining an x-ray.
So what is radiation really, and how much should we worry about its effects?
The answer begins with understanding that the word radiation describes two very different scientific phenomena: electromagnetic radiation and nuclear radiation.
Electromagnetic radiation is pure energy consisting of interacting electrical and magnetic waves oscillating through space.
As these waves oscillate faster, they scale up in energy.
At the lower end of the spectrum, there's radio, infrared, and visible light.
At the higher end are ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma rays.
Modern society is shaped by sending and detecting electromagnetic radiation.
We might download an email to our phone via radio waves to open an image of an X-ray print, which we can see because our screen emits visible light.
Nuclear radiation, on the other hand, originates in the atomic nucleus, where protons repel each other due to their mutually positive charges.
A phenomenon known as the strong nuclear force struggles to overcome this repulsion and keep the nucleus intact.
However, some combinations of protons and neutrons, known as isotopes, remain unstable, or radioactive.
They will randomly eject matter and/or energy, known as nuclear radiation, to achieve greater stability.
Nuclear radiation comes from natural sources, like radon, a gas which seeps up from the ground.
We also refine naturally occurring radioactive ores to fuel nuclear power plants.
Even bananas contain trace amounts of a radioactive potassium isotope.
So if we live in a world of radiation, how can we escape its dangerous effects?
To start, not all radiation is hazardous.
Radiation becomes risky when it rips atoms' electrons away upon impact, a process that can damage DNA.
This is known as ionizing radiation because an atom that has lost or gained electrons is called an ion.
All nuclear radiation is ionizing, while only the highest energy electromagnetic radiation is.
That includes gamma rays, X-rays, and the high-energy end of ultraviolet.
That's why as an extra precaution during X-rays, doctors shield body parts they don't need to examine, and why beach-goers use sunscreen.
In comparison, cell phones and microwaves operate at the lower end of the spectrum, so there is no risk of ionizing radiation from their use.
The biggest health risk occurs when lots of ionizing radiation hits us in a short time period, also known as an acute exposure.
Acute exposures overwhelm the body's natural ability to repair the damage.
This can trigger cancers, cellular dysfunction, and potentially even death.
Fortunately, acute exposures are rare, but we are exposed daily to lower levels of ionizing radiation from both natural and man-made sources.
Scientists have a harder time quantifying these risks.
Your body often repairs damage from small amounts ionizing radiation, and if it can't, the results of damage may not manifest for a decade or more.
One way scientists compare ionizing radiation exposure is a unit called the sievert.
An acute exposure to one sievert will probably cause nausea within hours, and four sieverts could be fatal.
However, our normal daily exposures are far lower.
The average person receives 6.2 millisieverts of radiation from all sources annually, around a third due to radon.
At only five microsieverts each, you'd need to get more than 1200 dental X-rays to rack up your annual dosage.
And remember that banana?
If you could absorb all the banana's radiation, you'd need around 170 a day to hit your annual dosage.
We live in a world of radiation.
However, much of that radiation is non-ionizing.
For the remainder that is ionizing, our exposures are usually low, and choices like getting your home tested for radon and wearing sunscreen can help reduce the associated health risks.
Marie Curie, one of the early radiation pioneers, summed up the challenge as follows: "Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood.
Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less."
Every day, a sea of decisions stretches before us.
Some are small and unimportant, but others have a larger impact on our lives.
For example, which politician should I vote for?
Should I try the latest diet craze?
Or will email make me a millionaire?
We're bombarded with so many decisions that it's impossible to make a perfect choice every time.
But there are many ways to improve our chances, and one particularly effective technique is critical thinking.
This is a way of approaching a question that allows us to carefully deconstruct a situation, reveal its hidden issues, such as bias and manipulation, and make the best decision.
If the critical part sounds negative that's because in a way it is.
Rather than choosing an answer because it feels right, a person who uses critical thinking subjects all available options to scrutiny and skepticism.
Using the tools at their disposal, they'll eliminate everything but the most useful and reliable information.
There are many different ways of approaching critical thinking, but here's one five-step process that may help you solve any number of problems.
One: formulate your question.
In other words, know what you're looking for.
This isn't always as straightforward as it sounds.
For example, if you're deciding whether to try out the newest diet craze, your reasons for doing so may be obscured by other factors, like claims that you'll see results in just two weeks.
But if you approach the situation with a clear view of what you're actually trying to accomplish by dieting, whether that's weight loss, better nutrition, or having more energy, that'll equip you to sift through this information critically, find what you're looking for, and decide whether the new fad really suits your needs.
Two: gather your information.
There's lots of it out there, so having a clear idea of your question will help you determine what's relevant.
If you're trying to decide on a diet to improve your nutrition, you may ask an expert for their advice, or seek other people's testimonies.
Information gathering helps you weigh different options, moving you closer to a decision that meets your goal.
Three: apply the information, something you do by asking critical questions.
Facing a decision, ask yourself, "What concepts are at work?"
"What assumptions exist?"
"Is my interpretation of the information logically sound?"
For example, in an email that promises you millions, you should consider, "What is shaping my approach to this situation?"
"Do I assume the sender is telling the truth?"
"Based on the evidence, is it logical to assume I'll win any money?"
Four: consider the implications.
Imagine it's election time, and you've selected a political candidate based on their promise to make it cheaper for drivers to fill up on gas.
At first glance, that seems great.
But what about the long-term environmental effects?
If gasoline use is less restricted by cost, this could also cause a huge surge in air pollution, an unintended consequence that's important to think about.
Five: explore other points of view.
Ask yourself why so many people are drawn to the policies of the opposing political candidate.
Even if you disagree with everything that candidate says, exploring the full spectrum of viewpoints might explain why some policies that don't seem valid to you appeal to others.
This will allow you to explore alternatives, evaluate your own choices, and ultimately help you make more informed decisions.
This five-step process is just one tool, and it certainly won't eradicate difficult decisions from our lives.
But it can help us increase the number of positive choices we make.
Critical thinking can give us the tools to sift through a sea of information and find what we're looking for.
And if enough of us use it, it has the power to make the world a more reasonable place.
Your rich, eccentric uncle just passed away, and you and your 99 nasty relatives have been invited to the reading of his will.
He wanted to leave all of his money to you, but he knew that if he did, your relatives would pester you forever.
So he is banking on the fact that he taught you everything you need to know about riddles.
Your uncle left the following note in his will: "I have created a puzzle.
If all 100 of you answer it together, you will share the money evenly.
However, if you are the first to find the pattern and solve the problem without going through all of the leg work, you will get the entire inheritance all to yourself.
Good luck."
The lawyer takes you and your 99 relatives to a secret room in the mansion that contains 100 lockers, each hiding a single word.
He explains: Every relative is assigned a number from 1 to 100.
Heir 1 will open every locker.
Heir 2 will then close every second locker.
Heir 3 will change the status of every third locker, specifically if it's open, she'll close it, but if it's closed, she'll open it.
This pattern will continue until all 100 of you have gone.
The words in the lockers that remain open at the end will help you crack the code for the safe.
Before cousin Thaddeus can even start down the line, you step forward and tell the lawyer you know which lockers will remain open.
But how?
Pause the video now if you want to figure it out for yourself!
Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 The key is realizing that the number of times a locker is touched is the same as the number of factors in the locker number.
For example, in locker #6, Person 1 will open it, Person 2 will close it, Person 3 will open it, and Person 6 will close it.
The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 6 are the factors of 6.
So when a locker has an even number of factors it will remain closed, and when it has an odd number of factors, it will remain open.
Most of the lockers have an even number of factors, which makes sense because factors naturally pair up.
In fact, the only lockers that have an odd number of factors are perfect squares because those have one factor that when multiplied by itself equals the number.
For Locker 9, 1 will open it, 3 will close, and 9 will open it.
3 x 3 = 9, but the 3 can only be counted once.
Therefore, every locker that is a perfect square will remain open.
You know that these ten lockers are the solution, so you open them immediately and read the words inside: "The code is the first five lockers touched only twice."
You realize that the only lockers touched twice have to be prime numbers since each only has two factors: 1 and itself.
So the code is 2-3-5-7-11.
The lawyer brings you to the safe, and you claim your inheritance.
Too bad your relatives were always too busy being nasty to each other to pay attention to your eccentric uncle's riddles.
Water is virtually everywhere, from soil moisture and ice caps, to the cells inside our own bodies.
Depending on factors like location, fat index, age, and sex, the average human is between 55-60% water.
At birth, human babies are even wetter.
Being 75% water, they are swimmingly similar to fish.
But their water composition drops to 65% by their first birthday.
So what role does water play in our bodies, and how much do we actually need to drink to stay healthy?
The H20 in our bodies works to cushion and lubricate joints, regulate temperature, and to nourish the brain and spinal cord.
Water isn't only in our blood.
An adult's brain and heart are almost three quarters water.
That's roughly equivalent to the amount of moisture in a banana.
Lungs are more similar to an apple at 83%.
And even seemingly dry human bones are 31% water.
If we are essentially made of water, and surrounded by water, why do we still need to drink so much?
Well, each day we lose two to three liters through our sweat, urine, and bowel movements, and even just from breathing.
While these functions are essential to our survival, we need to compensate for the fluid loss.
Maintaining a balanced water level is essential to avoid dehydration or over-hydration, both of which can have devastating effects on overall health.
At first detection of low water levels, sensory receptors in the brain's hypothalamus signal the release of antidiuretic hormone.
When it reached the kidneys, it creates aquaporins, special channels that enable blood to absorb and retain more water, leading to concentrated, dark urine.
Increased dehydration can cause notable drops in energy, mood, skin moisture, and blood pressure, as well as signs of cognitive impairment.
A dehydrated brain works harder to accomplish the same amount as a normal brain, and it even temporarily shrinks because of its lack of water.
Over-hydration, or hyponatremia, is usually caused by overconsumption of water in a short amount of time.
Athletes are often the victims of over-hydration because of complications in regulating water levels in extreme physical conditions.
Whereas the dehydrated brain amps up the production of antidiuretic hormone, the over-hydrated brain slows, or even stops, releasing it into the blood.
Sodium electrolytes in the body become diluted, causing cells to swell.
In severe cases, the kidneys can't keep up with the resulting volumes of dilute urine.
Water intoxication then occurs, possibly causing headache, vomiting, and, in rare instances, seizures or death.
But that's a pretty extreme situation.
On a normal, day-to-day basis, maintaining a well-hydrated system is easy to manage for those of us fortunate enough to have access to clean drinking water.
For a long time, conventional wisdom said that we should drink eight glasses a day.
That estimate has since been fine-tuned.
Now, the consensus is that the amount of water we need to imbibe depends largely on our weight and environment.
The recommended daily intake varies from between 2.5-3.7 liters of water for men, and about 2-2.7 liters for women, a range that is pushed up or down if we are healthy, active, old, or overheating.
While water is the healthiest hydrator, other beverages, even those with caffeine like coffee or tea, replenish fluids as well.
And water within food makes up about a fifth of our daily H20 intake.
Fruits and vegetables like strawberries, cucumbers, and even broccoli are over 90% water, and can supplement liquid intake while providing valuable nutrients and fiber.
Drinking well might also have various long-term benefits.
Studies have shown that optimal hydration can lower the chance of stroke, help manage diabetes, and potentially reduce the risk of certain types of cancer.
No matter what, getting the right amount of liquid makes a world of difference in how you'll feel, think, and function day to day.
How do schools of fish swim in harmony?
And how do the tiny cells in your brain give rise to the complex thoughts, memories, and consciousness that are you?
Oddly enough, those questions have the same general answer: emergence, or the spontaneous creation of sophisticated behaviors and functions from large groups of simple elements.
Like many animals, fish stick together in groups, but that's not just because they enjoy each other's company.
It's a matter of survival.
Schools of fish exhibit complex swarming behaviors that help them evade hungry predators, while a lone fish is quickly singled out as easy prey.
So which brilliant fish leader is the one in charge?
Actually, no one is, and everyone is.
So what does that mean?
While the school of fish is elegantly twisting, turning, and dodging sharks in what looks like deliberate coordination, each individual fish is actually just following two basic rules that have nothing to do with the shark: one, stay close, but not too close to your neighbor, and two, keep swimmming.
As individuals, the fish are focused on the minutiae of these local interactions, but if enough fish join the group, something remarkable happens.
The movement of individual fish is eclipsed by an entirely new entity: the school, which has its own unique set of behaviors.
The school isn't controlled by any single fish.
It simply emerges if you have enough fish following the right set of local rules.
It's like an accident that happens over and over again, allowing fish all across the ocean to reliably avoid predation.
And it's not just fish.
Emergence is a basic property of many complex systems of interacting elements.
For example, the specific way in which millions of grains of sand collide and tumble over each other almost always produces the same basic pattern of ripples.
And when moisture freezes in the atmosphere, the specific binding properties of water molecules reliably produce radiating lattices that form into beautiful snowflakes.
What makes emergence so complex is that you can't understand it by simply taking it apart, like the engine of a car.
Taking things apart is a good first step to understanding a complex system.
But if you reduce a school of fish to individuals, it loses the ability to evade predators, and there's nothing left to study.
And if you reduce the brain to individual neurons, you're left with something that is notoriously unreliable, and nothing like how we think and behave, at least most of the time.
Regardless, whatever you're thinking about right now isn't reliant on a single neuron lodged in the corner of your brain.
Rather, the mind emerges from the collective activities of many, many neurons.
There are billions of neurons in the human brain, and trillions of connections between all those neurons.
When you turn such a complicated system like that on, it could behave in all sorts of weird ways, but it doesn't.
The neurons in our brain follow simple rules, just like the fish, so that as a group, their activity self-organizes into reliable patterns that let you do things like recognize faces, successfully repeat the same task over and over again, and keep all those silly little habits that everyone likes about you.
So, what are the simple rules when it comes to the brain?
The basic function of each neuron in the brain is to either excite or inhibit other neurons.
If you connect a few neurons together into a simple circuit, you can generate rhythmic patterns of activity, feedback loops that ramp up or shut down a signal, coincidence detectors, and disinhibition, where two inhibitory neurons can actually activate another neuron by removing inhibitory brakes.
As more and more neurons are connected, increasingly complex patterns of activity emerge from the network.
Soon, so many neurons are interacting in so many different ways at once that the system becomes chaotic.
The trajectory of the network's activity cannot be easily explained by the simple local circuits described earlier.
And yet, from this chaos, patterns can emerge, and then emerge again and again in a reproducible manner.
At some point, these emergent patterns of activity become sufficiently complex, and curious to begin studying their own biological origins, not to mention emergence.
And what we found in emergent phenomena at vastly different scales is that same remarkable characteristic as the fish displayed: That emergence doesn't require someone or something to be in charge.
If the right rules are in place, and some basic conditions are met, a complex system will fall into the same habits over and over again, turning chaos into order.
That's true in the molecular pandemonium that lets your cells function, the tangled thicket of neurons that produces your thoughts and identity, your network of friends and family, all the way up to the structures and economies of our cities across the planet.
In 1996, 56 volunteers took part in a study to test a new painkiller called Trivaricaine.
On each subject, one index finger was covered in the new painkiller while the other remained untouched.
Then, both were squeezed in painful clamps.
The subjects reported that the treated finger hurt less than the untreated one.
This shouldn't be surprising, except Trivaricaine wasn't actually a painkiller, just a fake concotion with no pain-easing properties at all.
What made the students so sure this dummy drug had worked?
The answer lies in the placebo effect, an unexplained phenomenon wherein drugs, treatments, and therapies that aren't supposed to have an effect, and are often fake, miraculously make people feel better.
Doctors have used the term placebo since the 1700s when they realized the power of fake drugs to improve people's symptoms.
These were administered when proper drugs weren't available, or if someone imagined they were ill.
In fact, the word placebo means "I shall please" in Latin, hinting at a history of placating troubled patients.
Placebos had to mimic the real treatments in order to be convincing, so they took the form of sugar pills, water-filled injections, and even sham surgeries.
Soon, doctors realized that duping people in this way had another use: in clinical trials.
By the 1950s, researchers were using placebos as a standard tool to test new treatments.
To evaluate a new drug, for instance, half the patients in a trial might receive the real pill.
The other half would get a placebo that looked the same.
Since patients wouldn't know whether they'd received the real thing or a dud, the results wouldn't be biased, researchers believed.
Then, if the new drug showed a significant benefit compared to the placebo, it was proved effective.
Nowadays, it's less common to use placebos this way because of ethical concerns.
If it's possible to compare a new drug against an older version, or another existing drug, that's preferable to simply giving someone no treatment at all, especially if they have a serious ailment.
In these cases, placebos are often used as a control to fine-tune the trial so that the effects of the new versus the old or alternative drug can be precisely compared.
But of course, we know the placebos exert their own influence, too.
Thanks to the placebo effect, patients have experienced relief from a range of ailments, including heart problems, asthma, and severe pain, even though all they'd received was a fake drug or sham surgery.
We're still trying to understand how.
Some believe that instead of being real, the placebo effect is merely confused with other factors, like patients trying to please doctors by falsely reporting improvements.
On the other hand, researchers think that if a person believes a fake treatment is real, their expectations of recovery actually do trigger physiological factors that improve their symptoms.
Placebos seem to be capable of causing measurable change in blood pressure, heart rate, and the release of pain-reducing chemicals, like endorphins.
That explains why subjects in pain studies often say placebos ease their discomfort.
Placebos may even reduce levels of stress hormones, like adrenaline, which can slow the harmful effects of an ailment.
So shouldn't we celebrate the placebo's bizarre benefits?
Not necessarily.
If somebody believes a fake treatment has cured them, they may miss out on drugs or therapies that are proven to work.
Plus, the positive effects may fade over time, and often do.
Placebos also cloud clinical results, making scientists even more motivated to discover how they wield such power over us.
Despite everything we know about the human body, there are still some strange and enduring mysteries, like the placebo effect.
So what other undiscovered marvels might we contain?
It's easy to investigate the world around us and forget that one of its most fascinating subjects lies right behind our eyes.
You're telling a friend an amazing story, and you just get to the best part when suddenly he interrupts, "The alien and I," not "Me and the alien."
Most of us would probably be annoyed, but aside from the rude interruption, does your friend have a point?
Was your sentence actually grammatically incorrect?
And if he still understood it, why does it even matter?
From the point of view of linguistics, grammar is a set of patterns for how words are put together to form phrases or clauses, whether spoken or in writing.
Different languages have different patterns.
In English, the subject normally comes first, followed by the verb, and then the object, while in Japanese and many other languages, the order is subject, object, verb.
Some scholars have tried to identify patterns common to all languages, but apart from some basic features, like having nouns or verbs, few of these so-called linguistic universals have been found.
And while any language needs consistent patterns to function, the study of these patterns opens up an ongoing debate between two positions known as prescriptivism and descriptivism.
Grossly simplified, prescriptivists think a given language should follow consistent rules, while descriptivists see variation and adaptation as a natural and necessary part of language.
For much of history, the vast majority of language was spoken.
But as people became more interconnected and writing gained importance, written language was standardized to allow broader communication and ensure that people in different parts of a realm could understand each other.
In many languages, this standard form came to be considered the only proper one, despite being derived from just one of many spoken varieties, usually that of the people in power.
Language purists worked to establish and propagate this standard by detailing a set of rules that reflected the established grammar of their times.
And rules for written grammar were applied to spoken language, as well.
Speech patterns that deviated from the written rules were considered corruptions, or signs of low social status, and many people who had grown up speaking in these ways were forced to adopt the standardized form.
More recently, however, linguists have understood that speech is a separate phenomenon from writing with its own regularities and patterns.
Most of us learn to speak at such an early age that we don't even remember it.
We form our spoken repertoire through unconscious habits, not memorized rules.
And because speech also uses mood and intonation for meaning, its structure is often more flexible, adapting to the needs of speakers and listeners.
This could mean avoiding complex clauses that are hard to parse in real time, making changes to avoid awkward pronounciation, or removing sounds to make speech faster.
The linguistic approach that tries to understand and map such differences without dictating correct ones is known as descriptivism.
Rather than deciding how language should be used, it describes how people actually use it, and tracks the innovations they come up with in the process.
But while the debate between prescriptivism and descriptivism continues, the two are not mutually exclusive.
At its best, prescriptivism is useful for informing people about the most common established patterns at a given point in time.
This is important, not only for formal contexts, but it also makes communication easier between non-native speakers from different backgrounds.
Descriptivism, on the other hand, gives us insight into how our minds work and the instinctive ways in which we structure our view of the world.
Ultimately, grammar is best thought of as a set of linguistic habits that are constantly being negotiated and reinvented by the entire group of language users.
Like language itself, it's a wonderful and complex fabric woven through the contributions of speakers and listeners, writers and readers, prescriptivists and descriptivists, from both near and far.
There are a few things that all of us need.
We all need air to breathe.
We need clean water to drink.
We need food to eat. We need shelter and love.
You know. Love is great, too.
And we all need a safe place to pee.
(Laughter) Yeah?
As a trans person who doesn't fit neatly into the gender binary, if I could change the world tomorrow to make it easier for me to navigate, the very first thing I would do is blink and create single stall, gender-neutral bathrooms in all public places.
(Applause) Trans people and trans issues, they've been getting a lot of mainstream media attention lately.
And this is a great and necessary thing, but most of that attention has been focused on a very few individuals, most of whom are kinda rich and pretty famous, and probably don't have to worry that much anymore about where they're going to pee in between classes at their community college, or where they're going to get changed into their gym strip at their public high school.
Fame and money insulates these television star trans people from most of the everyday challenges that the rest of us have to tackle on a daily basis.
Public bathrooms.
They've been a problem for me since as far back as I can remember, first when I was just a little baby tomboy and then later as a masculine-appearing, predominantly estrogen-based organism.
(Laughter) Now, today as a trans person, public bathrooms and change rooms are where I am most likely to be questioned or harassed.
I've often been verbally attacked behind their doors.
I've been hauled out by security guards with my pants still halfway pulled up.
I've been stared at, screamed at, whispered about, and one time I got smacked in the face by a little old lady's purse that from the looks of the shiner I took home that day I am pretty certain contained at least 70 dollars of rolled up small change and a large hard candy collection.
(Laughter) And I know what some of you are thinking, and you're mostly right.
I can and do just use the men's room most of the time these days.
But that doesn't solve my change room dilemmas, does it?
And I shouldn't have to use the men's room because I'm not a man.
I'm a trans person.
And now we've got these fearmongering politicians that keep trying to pass these bathroom bills.
Have you heard about these?
They try to legislate to try and force people like myself to use the bathroom that they deem most appropriate according to the gender I was assigned at birth.
And if these politicians ever get their way, in Arizona or California or Florida or just last week in Houston, Texas, or Ottawa, well then, using the men's room will not be a legal option for me either.
And every time one of these politicians brings one of these bills to the table, I can't help but wonder, you know, just who will and exactly how would we go about enforcing laws like these. Right?
Panty checks?
Really.
Genital inspections outside of bath change rooms at public pools?
There's no legal or ethical or plausible way to enforce laws like these anyway.
They exist only to foster fear and promote transphobia.
They don't make anyone safer.
But they do for sure make the world more dangerous for some of us.
And meanwhile, our trans children suffer.
They drop out of school, or they opt out of life altogether.
Trans people, especially trans and gender-nonconforming youth face additional challenges when accessing pools and gyms, but also universities, hospitals, libraries.
Don't even get me started on how they treat us in airports.
If we don't move now to make sure that these places are truly open and accessible to everyone, then we just need to get honest and quit calling them public places.
We need to just admit that they are really only open for people who fit neatly into one of two gender boxes, which I do not.
I never have.
And this starts very early.
I know a little girl. She's the daughter of a friend of mine.
She's a self-identified tomboy.
I'm talking about cowboy boots and Caterpillar yellow toy trucks and bug jars, the whole nine yards.
One time I asked her what her favorite color was.
She told me, "Camouflage."
(Laughter) So that awesome little kid, she came home from school last October from her half day of preschool with soggy pants on because the other kids at school were harassing her when she tried to use the girls' bathroom.
And the teacher had already instructed her to stay out of the boys' bathroom.
And she had drank two glasses of that red juice at the Halloween party, and I mean, who can resist that red juice, right? It's so good.
And she couldn't hold her pee any longer.
Her and her classmates were four years old.
They already felt empowered enough to police her use of the so-called public bathrooms.
She was four years old.
She had already been taught the brutal lesson that there was no bathroom door at preschool with a sign on it that welcomed people like her.
She'd already learned that bathrooms were going to be a problem, and that problem started with her and was hers alone.
So my friend asked me to talk to her little daughter, and I did.
I wanted to tell her that me and her mom were going to march on down and talk to that school, and the problem was going to go away, but I knew that wasn't true.
I wanted to tell her that it was all going to get better when she got older, but I couldn't.
So I asked her to tell me the story of what had happened, asked her to tell me how it made her feel.
"Mad and sad," she told me.
So I told her that she wasn't alone and that it wasn't right what had happened to her, and then she asked me if I had ever peed in my pants before.
I said yes, I had, but not for a really long time.
(Laughter) Which of course was a lie, because you know how you hit, like, 42 or 43, and sometimes you just, I don't know, you pee a little bit when you cough or sneeze, when you're running upstairs, or you're stretching.
Don't lie.
It happens. Right?
She doesn't need to know that, I figure.
(Laughter) I told her, when you get older, your bladder is going to grow bigger, too.
When you get old like me, you're going to be able to hold your pee for way longer, I promised her.
"Until you can get home?"
she asked me.
I said, "Yes, until you can get home."
She seemed to take some comfort in that.
So let's just build some single stall, gender-neutral bathrooms with a little bench for getting changed into your gym clothes.
We can't change the world overnight for our children, but we can give them a safe and private place to escape that world, if only for just a minute.
This we can do.
So let's just do it.
And if you are one of those people who is sitting out there right now already coming up with a list of reasons in your head why this is not a priority, or it's too expensive, or telling yourself that giving a trans person a safe place to pee or get changed in supports a lifestyle choice that you feel offends your morality, or your masculinity, or your religious beliefs, then let me just appeal to the part of your heart that probably, hopefully, does care about the rest of the population.
If you can't bring yourself to care enough about people like me, then what about women and girls with body image issues?
What about anyone with body image stuff going on?
What about that boy at school who is a foot shorter than his classmates, whose voice still hasn't dropped yet? Hey?
Oh, grade eight, what a cruel master you can be.
Right?
What about people with anxiety issues?
What about people with disabilities or who need assistance in there?
What about folks with bodies who, for whatever reason, don't fit into the mainstream idea of what a body should look like?
How many of us still feel shy or afraid to disrobe in front of our peers, and how many of us allow that fear to keep us from something as important as physical exercise?
Would all those people not benefit from these single stall facilities?
We can't change transphobic minds overnight, but we can give everybody a place to get changed in so that we can all get to work making the world safer for all of us.
Thank you for listening.
(Applause) Thank you.
(Applause)
Imagine a police lineup where ten witnesses are asked to identify a bank robber they glimpsed fleeing the crime scene.
If six of them pick out the same person, there's a good chance that's the real culprit, and if all ten make the same choice, you might think the case is rock solid, but you'd be wrong.
For most of us, this sounds pretty strange.
After all, much of our society relies on majority vote and consensus, whether it's politics, business, or entertainment.
So it's natural to think that more consensus is a good thing.
And up until a certain point, it usually is.
But sometimes, the closer you start to get to total agreement, the less reliable the result becomes.
This is called the paradox of unanimity.
The key to understanding this apparent paradox is in considering the overall level of uncertainty involved in the type of situation you're dealing with.
If we asked witnesses to identify the apple in this lineup, for example, we shouldn't be surprised by a unanimous verdict.
But in cases where we have reason to expect some natural variance, we should also expect varied distribution.
If you toss a coin one hundred times, you would expect to get heads somewhere around 50% of the time.
But if your results started to approach 100% heads, you'd suspect that something was wrong, not with your individual flips, but with the coin itself.
Of course, suspect identifications aren't as random as coin tosses, but they're not as clear cut as telling apples from bananas, either.
In fact, a 1994 study found that up to 48% of witnesses tend to pick the wrong person out of a lineup, even when many are confident in their choice.
Memory based on short glimpses can be unreliable, and we often overestimate our own accuracy.
Knowing all this, a unanimous identification starts to seem less like certain guilt, and more like a systemic error, or bias in the lineup.
And systemic errors don't just appear in matters of human judgement.
From 1993-2008, the same female DNA was found in multiple crime scenes around Europe, incriminating an elusive killer dubbed the Phantom of Heilbronn.
But the DNA evidence was so consistent precisely because it was wrong.
It turned out that the cotton swabs used to collect the DNA samples had all been accidentally contaminated by a woman working in the swab factory.
In other cases, systematic errors arise through deliberate fraud, like the presidential referendum held by Saddam Hussein in 2002, which claimed a turnout of 100% of voters with all 100% supposedly voting in favor of another seven-year term.
When you look at it this way, the paradox of unanimity isn't actually all that paradoxical.
Unanimous agreement is still theoretically ideal, especially in cases when you'd expect very low odds of variability and uncertainty, but in practice, achieving it in situations where perfect agreement is highly unlikely should tell us that there's probably some hidden factor affecting the system.
Although we may strive for harmony and consensus, in many situations, error and disagreement should be naturally expected.
And if a perfect result seems too good to be true, it probably is.
It starts with a tickle in your throat that becomes a cough.
Your muscles begin to ache, you grow irritable, and you lose your appetite.
It's official: you've got the flu.
It's logical to assume that this miserable medley of symptoms is the result of the infection coursing through your body, but is that really the case?
What's actually making you feel sick?
What if your body itself was driving this vicious onslaught?
You first get ill when a pathogen like the flu virus gets into your system, infecting and killing your cells.
But this unwelcome intrusion has another effect: it alerts your body's immune system to your plight.
As soon as it becomes aware of infection, your body leaps to your defense.
Cells called macrophages charge in as the first line of attack, searching for and destroying the viruses and infected cells.
Afterwards, the macrophages release protein molecules called cytokines whose job is to recruit and organize more virus-busting cells from your immune system.
If this coordinated effort is strong enough, it'll wipe out the infection before you even notice it.
But that's just your body setting the scene for some real action.
In some cases, viruses spread further, even into the blood and vital organs.
To avoid this sometimes dangerous fate, your immune system must launch a stronger attack, coordinating its activity with the brain.
That's where those unpleasant symptoms come in, starting with the surging temperature, aches and pains, and sleepiness.
So why do we experience this?
When the immune system is under serious attack, it secretes more cytokines, which trigger two responses.
First, the vagus nerve, which runs through the body into the brain, quickly transmits the information to the brain stem, passing near an important area of pain processing.
Second, cytokines travel through the body to the hypothalamus, the part of the brain responsible for controlling temperature, thirst, hunger, and sleep, among other things.
When it receives this message, the hypothalamus produces another molecule called prostaglandin E2, which gears it up for war.
The hypothalamus sends signals that instruct your muscles to contract and causes a rise in body temperature.
It also makes you sleepy, and you lose your appetite and thirst.
But what's the point of all of these unpleasant symptoms?
Well, we're not yet sure, but some theorize that they aid in recovery.
The rise in temperature can slow bacteria and help your immune system destroy pathogens.
Sleep lets your body channel more energy towards fighting infection.
When you stop eating, your liver can take up much of the iron in your blood, and since iron is essential for bacterial survival, that effectively starves them.
Your reduced thirst makes you mildly dehydrated, diminishing transmission through sneezes, coughs, vomit, or diarrhea.
Though it's worth noting that if you don't drink enough water, that dehydration can become dangerous.
Even the body's aches make you more sensitive, drawing attention to infected cuts that might be worsening, or even causing your condition.
In addition to physical symptoms, sickness can also make you irritable, sad, and confused.
That's because cytokines and prostaglandin can reach even higher structures in your brain, disrupting the activity of neurotransmitters, like glutamate, endorphins, serotonin, and dopamine.
This affects areas like the limbic system, which oversees emotions, and your cerebral cortex, which is involved in reasoning.
So it's actually the body's own immune response that causes much of the discomfort you feel every time you get ill.
Unfortunately, it doesn't always work perfectly.
Most notably, millions of people worldwide suffer from autoimmune diseases, in which the immune system treats normal bodily cues as threats, so the body attacks itself.
But for the majority of the human race, millions of years of evolution have fine-tuned the immune system so that it works for, rather than against us.
The symptoms of our illnesses are annoying, but collectively, they signify an ancient process that will continue barricading our bodies against the outside world for centuries to come.
In many ways, our memories make us who we are, helping us remember our past, learn and retain skills, and plan for the future.
And for the computers that often act as extensions of ourselves, memory plays much the same role, whether it's a two-hour movie, a two-word text file, or the instructions for opening either, everything in a computer's memory takes the form of basic units called bits, or binary digits.
Each of these is stored in a memory cell that can switch between two states for two possible values, 0 and 1.
Files and programs consist of millions of these bits, all processed in the central processing unit, or CPU, that acts as the computer's brain.
And as the number of bits needing to be processed grows exponentially, computer designers face a constant struggle between size, cost, and speed.
Like us, computers have short-term memory for immediate tasks, and long-term memory for more permanent storage.
When you run a program, your operating system allocates area within the short-term memory for performing those instructions.
For example, when you press a key in a word processor, the CPU will access one of these locations to retrieve bits of data.
It could also modify them, or create new ones.
The time this takes is known as the memory's latency.
And because program instructions must be processed quickly and continuously, all locations within the short-term memory can be accessed in any order, hence the name random access memory.
The most common type of RAM is dynamic RAM, or DRAM.
There, each memory cell consists of a tiny transistor and a capacitor that store electrical charges, a 0 when there's no charge, or a 1 when charged.
Such memory is called dynamic because it only holds charges briefly before they leak away, requiring periodic recharging to retain data.
But even its low latency of 100 nanoseconds is too long for modern CPUs, so there's also a small, high-speed internal memory cache made from static RAM.
That's usually made up of six interlocked transistors which don't need refreshing.
SRAM is the fastest memory in a computer system, but also the most expensive, and takes up three times more space than DRAM.
But RAM and cache can only hold data as long as they're powered.
For data to remain once the device is turned off, it must be transferred into a long-term storage device, which comes in three major types.
In magnetic storage, which is the cheapest, data is stored as a magnetic pattern on a spinning disc coated with magnetic film.
But because the disc must rotate to where the data is located in order to be read, the latency for such drives is 100,000 times slower than that of DRAM.
On the other hand, optical-based storage like DVD and Blu-ray also uses spinning discs, but with a reflective coating.
Bits are encoded as light and dark spots using a dye that can be read by a laser.
While optical storage media are cheap and removable, they have even slower latencies than magnetic storage and lower capacity as well.
Finally, the newest and fastest types of long-term storage are solid-state drives, like flash sticks.
These have no moving parts, instead using floating gate transistors that store bits by trapping or removing electrical charges within their specially designed internal structures.
So how reliable are these billions of bits?
We tend to think of computer memory as stable and permanent, but it actually degrades fairly quickly.
The heat generated from a device and its environment will eventually demagnetize hard drives, degrade the dye in optical media, and cause charge leakage in floating gates.
Solid-state drives also have an additional weakness.
Repeatedly writing to floating gate transistors corrodes them, eventually rendering them useless.
With data on most current storage media having less than a ten-year life expectancy, scientists are working to exploit the physical properties of materials down to the quantum level in the hopes of making memory devices faster, smaller, and more durable.
For now, immortality remains out of reach, for humans and computers alike.
As a kid, I used to dream about the ocean.
It was this wild place full of color and life, home to these alien-looking, fantastical creatures.
I pictured big sharks ruling the food chain and saw graceful sea turtles dancing across coral reefs.
As a marine biologist turned photographer, I've spent most of my career looking for places as magical as those I used to dream about when I was little.
As you can see, I began exploring bodies of water at a fairly young age.
But the first time I truly went underwater, I was about 10 years old.
And I can still vividly remember furiously finning to reach this old, encrusted cannon on a shallow coral reef.
And when I finally managed to grab hold of it, I looked up, and I was instantly surrounded by fish in all colors of the rainbow.
That was the day I fell in love with the ocean.
Thomas Peschak Conservation Photographer In my 40 years on this planet, I've had the great privilege to explore some of its most incredible seascapes for National Geographic Magazine and the Save Our Seas Foundation.
I've photographed everything from really, really big sharks to dainty ones that fit in the palm of your hand.
I've smelled the fishy, fishy breath of humpback whales feeding just feet away from me in the cold seas off Canada's Great Bear Rainforest.
And I've been privy to the mating rituals of green sea turtles in the Mozambique Channel.
Everyone on this planet affects and is affected by the ocean.
And the pristine seas I used to dream of as a child are becoming harder and harder to find.
They are becoming more compressed and more threatened.
As we humans continue to maintain our role as the leading predator on earth, I've witnessed and photographed many of these ripple effects firsthand.
For a long time, I thought I had to shock my audience out of their indifference with disturbing images.
And while this approach has merits, I have come full circle.
I believe that the best way for me to effect change is to sell love.
I guess I'm a matchmaker of sorts and as a photographer, I have the rare opportunity to reveal animals and entire ecosystems that lie hidden beneath the ocean's surface.
You can't love something and become a champion for it if you don't know it exists.
Uncovering this -- that is the power of conservation photography.
(Music) I've visited hundreds of marine locations, but there are a handful of seascapes that have touched me incredibly deeply.
The first time I experienced that kind of high was about 10 years ago, off South Africa's rugged, wild coast.
And every June and July, enormous shoals of sardines travel northwards in a mass migration we call the Sardine Run.
And boy, do those fish have good reason to run.
In hot pursuit are hoards of hungry and agile predators.
Common dolphins hunt together and they can separate some of the sardines from the main shoal and they create bait balls.
They drive and trap the fish upward against the ocean surface and then they rush in to dine on this pulsating and movable feast.
Close behind are sharks.
Now, most people believe that sharks and dolphins are these mortal enemies, but during the Sardine Run, they actually coexist.
In fact, dolphins actually help sharks feed more effectively.
Without dolphins, the bait balls are more dispersed and sharks often end up with what I call a sardine donut, or a mouth full of water.
Now, while I've had a few spicy moments with sharks on the sardine run, I know they don't see me as prey.
However, I get bumped and tail-slapped just like any other guest at this rowdy, rowdy banquet.
From the shores of Africa we travel east, across the vastness that is the Indian Ocean to the Maldives, an archipelago of coral islands.
And during the stormy southwest monsoon, manta rays from all across the archipelago travel to a tiny speck in Baa Atoll called Hanifaru.
Armies of crustaceans, most no bigger than the size of your pupils, are the mainstay of the manta ray's diet.
When plankton concentrations become patchy, manta rays feed alone and they somersault themselves backwards again and again, very much like a puppy chasing its own tail.
(Music) However, when plankton densities increase, the mantas line up head-to-tail to form these long feeding chains, and any tasty morsel that escapes the first or second manta in line is surely to be gobbled up by the next or the one after.
As plankton levels peak in the bay, the mantas swim closer and closer together in a unique behavior we call cyclone feeding.
And as they swirl in tight formation, this multi-step column of mantas creates its own vortex, sucking in and delivering the plankton right into the mantas' cavernous mouths.
The experience of diving amongst such masses of hundreds of rays is truly unforgettable.
(Music) When I first photographed Hanifaru, the site enjoyed no protection and was threatened by development.
And working with NGOs like the Manta Trust, my images eventually helped Hanifaru become a marine-protected area.
Now, fisherman from neighboring islands, they once hunted these manta rays to make traditional drums from their skins.
Today, they are the most ardent conservation champions and manta rays earn the Maldivian economy in excess of 8 million dollars every single year.
I have always wanted to travel back in time to an era where maps were mostly blank or they read, "There be dragons."
And today, the closest I've come is visiting remote atolls in the western Indian Ocean.
Far, far away from shipping lanes and fishing fleets, diving into these waters is a poignant reminder of what our oceans once looked like.
Very few people have heard of Bassas da India, a tiny speck of coral in the Mozambique Channel.
Its reef forms a protective outer barrier and the inner lagoon is a nursery ground for Galapagos sharks.
These sharks are anything but shy, even during the day.
I had a bit of a hunch that they'd be even bolder and more abundant at night.
(Music) Never before have I encountered so many sharks on a single coral outcrop.
Capturing and sharing moments like this -- that reminds me why I chose my path.
Earlier this year, I was on assignment for National Geographic Magazine in Baja California.
And about halfway down the peninsula on the Pacific side lies San Ignacio Lagoon, a critical calving ground for gray whales.
For 100 years, this coast was the scene of a wholesale slaughter, where more than 20,000 gray whales were killed, leaving only a few hundred survivors.
Today the descendents of these same whales nudge their youngsters to the surface to play and even interact with us.
(Music) This species truly has made a remarkable comeback.
Now, on the other side of the peninsula lies Cabo Pulmo, a sleepy fishing village.
Decades of overfishing had brought them close to collapse.
In 1995, local fisherman convinced the authorities to proclaim their waters a marine reserve.
But what happened next was nothing short of miraculous.
In 2005, after only a single decade of protection, scientists measured the largest recovery of fish ever recorded.
But don't take my word for it -- come with me.
On a single breath, swim with me in deep, into one of the largest and densest schools of fish I have ever encountered.
(Music) We all have the ability to be creators of hope.
And through my photography, I want to pass on the message that it is not too late for our oceans.
And particularly, I want to focus on nature's resilience in the face of 7.3 billion people.
My hope is that in the future, I will have to search much, much harder to make photographs like this, while creating images that showcase our respectful coexistence with the ocean.
Those will hopefully become an everyday occurrence for me.
To thrive and survive in my profession, you really have to be a hopeless optimist.
And I always operate on the assumption that the next great picture that will effect change is right around the corner, behind the next coral head, inside the next lagoon or possibly, in the one after it.
(Music)
Let's say you're on a game show.
You've already earned $1000 in the first round when you land on the bonus space.
Now, you have a choice.
You can either take a $500 bonus guaranteed or you can flip a coin.
If it's heads, you win $1000 bonus.
If it's tails, you get no bonus at all.
In the second round, you've earned $2000 when you land on the penalty space.
Now you have another choice.
You can either take a $500 loss, or try your luck at the coin flip.
If it's heads, you lose nothing, but if it's tails, you lose $1000 instead.
If you're like most people, you probably chose to take the guaranteed bonus in the first round and flip the coin in the second round.
But if you think about it, this makes no sense.
The odds and outcomes in both rounds are exactly the same.
So why does the second round seem much scarier?
The answer lies in a phenomenon known as loss aversion.
Under rational economic theory, our decisions should follow a simple mathematical equation that weighs the level of risk against the amount at stake.
But studies have found that for many people, the negative psychological impact we feel from losing something is about twice as strong as the positive impact of gaining the same thing.
Loss aversion is one cognitive bias that arises from heuristics, problem-solving approaches based on previous experience and intuition rather than careful analysis.
And these mental shortcuts can lead to irrational decisions, not like falling in love or bungee jumping off a cliff, but logical fallacies that can easily be proven wrong.
Situations involving probability are notoriously bad for applying heuristics.
For instance, say you were to roll a die with four green faces and two red faces twenty times.
You can choose one of the following sequences of rolls, and if it shows up, you'll win $25.
Which would you pick?
In one study, 65% of the participants who were all college students chose sequence B even though A is shorter and contained within B, in other words, more likely.
This is what's called a conjunction fallacy.
Here, we expect to see more green rolls, so our brains can trick us into picking the less likely option.
Heuristics are also terrible at dealing with numbers in general.
In one example, students were split into two groups.
The first group was asked whether Mahatma Gandhi died before or after age 9, while the second was asked whether he died before or after age 140.
Both numbers were obviously way off, but when the students were then asked to guess the actual age at which he died, the first group's answers averaged to 50 while the second group's averaged to 67.
Even though the clearly wrong information in the initial questions should have been irrelevant, it still affected the students' estimates.
This is an example of the anchoring effect, and it's often used in marketing and negotiations to raise the prices that people are willing to pay.
So, if heuristics lead to all these wrong decisions, why do we even have them?
Well, because they can be quite effective.
For most of human history, survival depended on making quick decisions with limited information.
When there's no time to logically analyze all the possibilities, heuristics can sometimes save our lives.
But today's environment requires far more complex decision-making, and these decisions are more biased by unconscious factors than we think, affecting everything from health and education to finance and criminal justice.
We can't just shut off our brain's heuristics, but we can learn to be aware of them.
When you come to a situation involving numbers, probability, or multiple details, pause for a second and consider that the intuitive answer might not be the right one after all.
If you line up the entire text of "Moby Dick," which was published in 1851, into a giant rectangle, you may notice some peculiar patterns, like these words, which seem to predict the assassination of Martin Luther King, or these references to the 1997 death of Princess Di.
So, was Herman Melville a secret prophet?
The answer is no, and we know that thanks to a mathematical principle called Ramsey theory.
It's the reason we can find geometric shapes in the night sky, it's why we can know without checking that at least two people in London have exactly the same number of hairs on their head, and it explains why patterns can be found in just about any text, even Vanilla Ice lyrics.
So what is Ramsey theory?
Simply put, it states that given enough elements in a set or structure, some particular interesting pattern among them is guaranteed to emerge.
As a simple example, let's look at what's called the party problem, a classic illustration of Ramsey theory.
Suppose there are at least six people at a party.
Amazingly enough, we can say for sure that some group of three of them either all know each other, or have never met before, without knowing a single thing about them.
We can demonstrate that by graphing out all the possibilities.
Each point represents a person, and a line indicates that the pair know each other.
Every pair only has two possibilities: they either know each other or they don't.
There are a lot of possibilities, but every single one has the property that we're looking for.
Six is the lowest number of guests where that's guaranteed to be the case, which we can express like this.
Ramsey theory gives us a guarantee that such a minimum number exists for certain patterns, but no easy way to find it.
In this case, as the total number of guests grows higher, the combinations get out of control.
For instance, say you're trying to find out the minimum size of a party where there's a group of five people who all know each other or all don't.
Despite five being a small number, the answer is virtually impossible to discover through an exhaustive search like this.
That's because of the sheer volume of possibilities.
A party with 48 guests has 2^(1128) possible configurations, more than the number of atoms in the Universe.
Even with the help of computers, the best we know is that the answer to this question is somewhere between 43 and 49 guests.
What this shows us is that specific patterns with seemingly astronomical odds can emerge from a relatively small set.
And with a very large set, the possibilities are almost endless.
Any four stars where no three lie in a straight line will form some quadrilateral shape.
Expand that to the thousands of stars we can see in the sky, and it's no surprise that we can find all sorts of familiar shapes, and even creatures if we look for them.
So what are the chances of a text concealing a prophecy?
Well, when you factor in the number of letters, the variety of possible related words, and all their abbreviations and alternate spellings, they're pretty high.
You can try it yourself.
Just pick a favorite text, arrange the letters in a grid, and see what you can find.
The mathematician T.S. Motzkin once remarked that, "while disorder is more probable in general, complete disorder is impossible."
The sheer size of the Universe guarantees that some of its random elements will fall into specific arrangements, and because we evolved to notice patterns and pick out signals among the noise, we are often tempted to find intentional meaning where there may not be any.
So while we may be awed by hidden messages in everything from books, to pieces of toast, to the night sky, their real origin is usually our own minds.
As your country's top spy, you must infiltrate the headquarters of the evil syndicate, find the secret control panel, and deactivate their death ray.
But all you have to go on is the following information picked up by your surveillance team.
The headquarters is a massive pyramid with a single room at the top level, two rooms on the next, and so on.
The control panel is hidden behind a painting on the highest floor that can satisfy the following conditions: Each room has exactly three doors to other rooms on that floor, except the control panel room, which connects to only one, there are no hallways, and you can ignore stairs.
Unfortunately, you don't have a floor plan, and you'll only have enough time to search a single floor before the alarm system reactivates.
Can you figure out which floor the control room is on?
Pause now to solve the riddle yourself.
Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 To solve this problem, we need to visualize it.
For starters, we know that on the correct floor there's one room, let's call it room A, with one door to the control panel room, plus one door to room B, and one to C.
So there must be at least four rooms, which we can represent as circles, drawing lines between them for the doorways.
But once we connect rooms B and C, there are no other connections possible, so the fourth floor down from the top is out.
We know the control panel has to be as high up as possible, so let's make our way down the pyramid.
The fifth highest floor doesn't work either.
We can figure that out by drawing it, but to be sure we haven't missed any possibilities, here's another way.
Every door corresponds to a line in our graph that makes two rooms into neighbors.
So in the end, there have to be an even number of neighbors no matter how many connections we make.
On the fifth highest floor, to fulfill our starting conditions, we'd need four rooms with three neighbors each, plus the control panel room with one neighbor, which makes 13 total neighbors.
Since that's an odd number, it's not possible, and, in fact, this also rules out every floor that has an odd number of rooms.
So let's go one more floor down.
When we draw out the rooms, low and behold, we can find an arrangement that works like this.
Incidentally, the study of such visual models that show the connections and relationships between different objects is known as graph theory.
In a basic graph, the circles representing the objects are known as nodes, while the connecting lines are called edges.
Researchers studying such graphs ask questions like, "How far is this node from that one?"
"How many edges does the most popular node have?"
"Is there a route between these two nodes, and if so, how long is it?"
Graphs like this are often used to map communication networks, but they can represent almost any kind of network, from transport connections within a city and social relationships among people, to chemical interactions between proteins or the spread of an epidemic through different locations.
So, armed with these techniques, back to the pyramid.
You avoid the guards and security cameras, infiltrate the sixth floor from the top, find the hidden panel, pull some conspicuous levers, and send the death ray crashing into the ocean.
Now, time to solve the mystery of why your surveillance team always gives you cryptic information.
Hi everybody.
If you liked this riddle, try solving these two.
All right, I want to see a show of hands: how many of you have unfriended someone on Facebook because they said something offensive about politics or religion, childcare, food?
(Laughter) And how many of you know at least one person that you avoid because you just don't want to talk to them?
(Laughter) You know, it used to be that in order to have a polite conversation, we just had to follow the advice of Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady": Stick to the weather and your health.
But these days, with climate change and anti-vaxxing, those subjects -- (Laughter) are not safe either.
So this world that we live in, this world in which every conversation has the potential to devolve into an argument, where our politicians can't speak to one another and where even the most trivial of issues have someone fighting both passionately for it and against it, it's not normal.
Pew Research did a study of 10,000 American adults, and they found that at this moment, we are more polarized, we are more divided, than we ever have been in history.
We're less likely to compromise, which means we're not listening to each other.
And we make decisions about where to live, who to marry and even who our friends are going to be, based on what we already believe.
Again, that means we're not listening to each other.
A conversation requires a balance between talking and listening, and somewhere along the way, we lost that balance.
Now, part of that is due to technology.
The smartphones that you all either have in your hands or close enough that you could grab them really quickly.
According to Pew Research, about a third of American teenagers send more than a hundred texts a day.
And many of them, almost most of them, are more likely to text their friends than they are to talk to them face to face.
There's this great piece in The Atlantic.
And he gave his kids a communication project.
He wanted to teach them how to speak on a specific subject without using notes.
And he said this: "I came to realize..."
(Laughter) "I came to realize that conversational competence might be the single most overlooked skill we fail to teach.
Kids spend hours each day engaging with ideas and each other through screens, but rarely do they have an opportunity to hone their interpersonal communications skills.
It might sound like a funny question, but we have to ask ourselves: Is there any 21st-century skill more important than being able to sustain coherent, confident conversation?"
Now, I make my living talking to people: Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state, plumbers.
I talk to people that I like. I talk to people that I don't like.
I talk to some people that I disagree with deeply on a personal level.
But I still have a great conversation with them.
So I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes or so teaching you how to talk and how to listen.
Many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this, things like look the person in the eye, think of interesting topics to discuss in advance, look, nod and smile to show that you're paying attention, repeat back what you just heard or summarize it.
So I want you to forget all of that.
It is crap.
(Laughter) There is no reason to learn how to show you're paying attention if you are in fact paying attention.
(Laughter) (Applause) Now, I actually use the exact same skills as a professional interviewer that I do in regular life.
So, I'm going to teach you how to interview people, and that's actually going to help you learn how to be better conversationalists.
Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time, without getting bored, and, please God, without offending anybody.
We've all had really great conversations.
We've had them before. We know what it's like.
The kind of conversation where you walk away feeling engaged and inspired, or where you feel like you've made a real connection or you've been perfectly understood.
There is no reason why most of your interactions can't be like that.
So I have 10 basic rules. I'm going to walk you through all of them, but honestly, if you just choose one of them and master it, you'll already enjoy better conversations.
Number one: Don't multitask.
And I don't mean just set down your cell phone or your tablet or your car keys or whatever is in your hand.
I mean, be present.
Be in that moment.
Don't think about your argument you had with your boss.
Don't think about what you're going to have for dinner.
If you want to get out of the conversation, get out of the conversation, but don't be half in it and half out of it.
Number two: Don't pontificate.
If you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response or argument or pushback or growth, write a blog.
(Laughter) Now, there's a really good reason why I don't allow pundits on my show: Because they're really boring.
If they're conservative, they're going to hate Obama and food stamps and abortion.
If they're liberal, they're going to hate big banks and oil corporations and Dick Cheney.
Totally predictable.
And you don't want to be like that.
You need to enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn.
The famed therapist M. Scott Peck said that true listening requires a setting aside of oneself.
And sometimes that means setting aside your personal opinion.
He said that sensing this acceptance, the speaker will become less and less vulnerable and more and more likely to open up the inner recesses of his or her mind to the listener.
Again, assume that you have something to learn.
Bill Nye: "Everyone you will ever meet knows something that you don't."
I put it this way: Everybody is an expert in something.
Number three: Use open-ended questions.
In this case, take a cue from journalists.
Start your questions with who, what, when, where, why or how.
If you put in a complicated question, you're going to get a simple answer out.
If I ask you, "Were you terrified?"
you're going to respond to the most powerful word in that sentence, which is "terrified," and the answer is "Yes, I was" or "No, I wasn't."
"Were you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry."
Let them describe it. They're the ones that know.
Try asking them things like, "What was that like?"
"How did that feel?"
Because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it, and you're going to get a much more interesting response.
Number four: Go with the flow.
That means thoughts will come into your mind and you need to let them go out of your mind.
We've heard interviews often in which a guest is talking for several minutes and then the host comes back in and asks a question which seems like it comes out of nowhere, or it's already been answered.
That means the host probably stopped listening two minutes ago because he thought of this really clever question, and he was just bound and determined to say that.
And we do the exact same thing.
We're sitting there having a conversation with someone, and then we remember that time that we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop.
(Laughter) And we stop listening.
Stories and ideas are going to come to you.
You need to let them come and let them go.
Number five: If you don't know, say that you don't know.
Now, people on the radio, especially on NPR, are much more aware that they're going on the record, and so they're more careful about what they claim to be an expert in and what they claim to know for sure.
Do that. Err on the side of caution.
Talk should not be cheap.
Number six: Don't equate your experience with theirs.
If they're talking about having lost a family member, don't start talking about the time you lost a family member.
If they're talking about the trouble they're having at work, don't tell them about how much you hate your job.
It's not the same. It is never the same.
All experiences are individual.
And, more importantly, it is not about you.
You don't need to take that moment to prove how amazing you are or how much you've suffered.
Somebody asked Stephen Hawking once what his IQ was, and he said, "I have no idea. People who brag about their IQs are losers."
(Laughter) Conversations are not a promotional opportunity.
Number seven: Try not to repeat yourself.
It's condescending, and it's really boring, and we tend to do it a lot.
Especially in work conversations or in conversations with our kids, we have a point to make, so we just keep rephrasing it over and over.
Don't do that.
Number eight: Stay out of the weeds.
Frankly, people don't care about the years, the names, the dates, all those details that you're struggling to come up with in your mind.
They don't care. What they care about is you.
They care about what you're like, what you have in common.
So forget the details. Leave them out.
Number nine: This is not the last one, but it is the most important one.
Listen.
I cannot tell you how many really important people have said that listening is perhaps the most, the number one most important skill that you could develop.
Buddha said, and I'm paraphrasing, "If your mouth is open, you're not learning."
And Calvin Coolidge said, "No man ever listened his way out of a job."
(Laughter) Why do we not listen to each other?
Number one, we'd rather talk.
When I'm talking, I'm in control.
I don't have to hear anything I'm not interested in.
I'm the center of attention.
I can bolster my own identity.
But there's another reason: We get distracted.
The average person talks at about 225 word per minute, but we can listen at up to 500 words per minute.
So our minds are filling in those other 275 words.
And look, I know, it takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone, but if you can't do that, you're not in a conversation.
You're just two people shouting out barely related sentences in the same place.
(Laughter) You have to listen to one another.
Stephen Covey said it very beautifully.
He said, "Most of us don't listen with the intent to understand.
We listen with the intent to reply."
One more rule, number 10, and it's this one: Be brief.
[A good conversation is like a miniskirt; short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject. -- My Sister] (Laughter) (Applause) All of this boils down to the same basic concept, and it is this one: Be interested in other people.
You know, I grew up with a very famous grandfather, and there was kind of a ritual in my home.
People would come over to talk to my grandparents, and after they would leave, my mother would come over to us, and she'd say, "Do you know who that was?
She was the runner-up to Miss America.
He was the mayor of Sacramento.
She won a Pulitzer Prize. He's a Russian ballet dancer."
And I kind of grew up assuming everyone has some hidden, amazing thing about them.
And honestly, I think it's what makes me a better host.
I keep my mouth shut as often as I possibly can, I keep my mind open, and I'm always prepared to be amazed, and I'm never disappointed.
You do the same thing.
Go out, talk to people, listen to people, and, most importantly, be prepared to be amazed.
Thanks.
(Applause)
In 1956, during a diplomatic reception in Moscow, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev told Western Bloc ambassadors, "My vas pokhoronim!"
His interpreter rendered that into English as, "We will bury you!"
This statement sent shockwaves through the Western world, heightening the tension between the Soviet Union and the US who were in the thick of the Cold War.
Some believe this incident alone set East/West relations back a decade.
As it turns out, Khrushchev's remark was translated a bit too literally.
Given the context, his words should have been rendered as, "We will live to see you buried," meaning that Communism would outlast Capitalism, a less threatening comment.
Though the intended meaning was eventually clarified, the initial impact of Khrushchev's apparent words put the world on a path that could have led to nuclear armageddon.
So now, given the complexities of language and cultural exchange, how does this sort of thing not happen all the time?
Much of the answer lies with the skill and training of interpreters to overcome language barriers.
For most of history, interpretation was mainly done consecutively, with speakers and interpreters making pauses to allow each other to speak.
But after the advent of radio technology, a new simultaneous interpretations system was developed in the wake of World War II.
In the simultaneous mode interpreters instantaneously translate a speaker's words into a microphone while he speaks.
Without pauses, those in the audience can choose the language in which they want to follow.
On the surface, it all looks seamless, but behind the scenes, human interpreters work incessantly to ensure every idea gets across as intended.
And that is no easy task.
It takes about two years of training for already fluent bilingual professionals to expand their vocabulary and master the skills necessary to become a conference interpreter.
To get used to the unnatural task of speaking while they listen, students shadow speakers and repeat their every word exactly as heard in the same language.
In time, they begin to paraphrase what is said, making stylistic adjustments as they go.
At some point, a second language is introduced.
Practicing in this way creates new neural pathways in the interpreter's brain, and the constant effort of reformulation gradually becomes second nature.
Over time and through much hard work, the interpreter masters a vast array of tricks to keep up with speed, deal with challenging terminology, and handle a multitude of foreign accents.
They may resort to acronyms to shorten long names, choose generic terms over specific, or refer to slides and other visual aides.
They can even leave a term in the original language, while they search for the most accurate equivalent.
Interpreters are also skilled at keeping aplomb in the face of chaos.
Remember, they have no control over who is going to say what, or how articulate the speaker will sound.
A curveball can be thrown at any time.
Also, they often perform to thousands of people and in very intimidating settings, like the UN General Assembly.
To keep their emotions in check, they carefully prepare for an assignment, building glossaries in advance, reading voraciously about the subject matter, and reviewing previous talks on the topic.
Finally, interpreters work in pairs.
While one colleague is busy translating incoming speeches in real time, the other gives support by locating documents, looking up words, and tracking down pertinent information.
Because simultaneous interpretation requires intense concentration, every 30 minutes, the pair switches roles.
Success is heavily dependent on skillful collaboration.
Language is complex, and when abstract or nuanced concepts get lost in translation, the consequences may be catastrophic.
As Margaret Atwood famously noted, "War is what happens when language fails."
Conference interpreters of all people are aware of that and work diligently behind the scenes to make sure it never does.
In 1997, a French woman named Jeanne Calment passed away after 122 years and 164 days on this Earth, making her the oldest known person in history.
Her age was so astounding that a millionaire pledged $1 million to anyone who could break her record.
But in reality, living to this age or beyond is a feat that very few, maybe even no humans, are likely to accomplish.
Human bodies just aren't built for extreme aging.
Our capacity is set at about 90 years.
But what does aging really mean and how does it counteract the body's efforts to stay alive?
We know intuitively what it means to age.
For some, it means growing up, while for others, it's growing old.
Yet finding a strict scientific definition of aging is a challenge.
What we can say is that aging occurs when intrinsic processes and interactions with the environment, like sunlight, and toxins in the air, water, and our diets, cause changes in the structure and function of the body's molecules and cells.
Those changes in turn drive their decline, and subsequently, the failure of the whole organism.
The exact mechanisms of aging are poorly understood.
But recently, scientists have identified nine physiological traits, ranging from genetic changes to alterations in a cell's regenerative ability that play a central role.
Firstly, as the years pass, our bodies accumulate genetic damage in the form of DNA lesions.
These occur naturally when the body's DNA replicates, but also in non-dividing cells.
Organelles called mitochondria are especially prone to this damage.
Mitochondria produce adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, the main energy source for all cellular processes, plus mitochondria regulate many different cell activities and play an important role in programmed cell death.
If mitochondrial function declines, then cells and, later on, whole organs, deteriorate, too.
Other changes are known to occur in the expression patterns of genes, also known as epigenetic alterations, that affect the body's tissues and cells.
Genes silenced or expressed only at low levels in newborns become prominent in older people, leading to the development of degenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's, which accelerate aging.
Even if we could avoid all these harmful genetic alterations, not even our own cells could save us.
The fact remains that cellular regeneration, the very stuff of life, declines as we age.
The DNA in our cells is packaged within chromosomes, each of which has two protective regions at the extremities called telomeres.
Those shorten every time cells replicate.
When telomeres become too short, cells stop replicating and die, slowing the body's ability to renew itself.
With age, cells increasingly grow senescent, too, a process that halts the cell cycle in times of risk, like when cancer cells are proliferating.
But the response also kicks in more as we age, halting cell growth and cutting short their ability to replicate.
Aging also involves stem cells that reside in many tissues and have the property of dividing without limits to replenish other cells.
As we get older, stem cells decrease in number and tend to lose their regenerative potential, affecting tissue renewal and maintenance of our organs original functions.
Other changes revolve around cells' ability to function properly.
As they age, they stop being able to do quality control on proteins, causing the accumulation of damaged and potentially toxic nutrients, leading to excessive metabolic activity that could be fatal for them.
Intercellular communication also slows, ultimately undermining the body's functional ability.
There's a lot we don't yet understand about aging.
Ultimately, does longer life as we know it come down to diet, exercise, medicine, or something else?
Will future technologies, like cell-repairing nanobots, or gene therapy, artificially extend our years?
And do we want to live longer than we already do?
Starting with 122 years as inspiration, there's no telling where our curiosity might take us.
Around the globe, there are approximately 60 million people who have been forced to leave their homes to escape war, violence, and persecution.
The majority of them have become internally displaced persons, which means they have fled their homes but are still within their own countries.
Others have crossed a border and sought shelter outside of their own countries.
They are commonly referred to as refugees.
But what exactly does that term mean?
The world has known refugees for millennia, but the modern definition was drafted in the UN's 1951 Convention relating to the status of refugees in response to mass persecutions and displacements of the Second World War.
It defines a refugee as someone who is outside their country of nationality, and is unable to return to their home country because of well-founded fears of being persecuted.
That persecution may be due to their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, and is often related to war and violence.
Today, roughly half the world's refugees are children, some of them unaccompanied by an adult, a situation that makes them especially vulnerable to child labor or sexual exploitation.
Each refugee's story is different, and many must undergo dangerous journeys with uncertain outcomes.
But before we get to what their journeys involve, let's clear one thing up.
There's a lot of confusion regarding the difference between the terms "migrant" and "refugee."
"Migrants" usually refers to people who leave their country for reasons not related to persecution, such as searching for better economic opportunities or leaving drought-stricken areas in search of better circumstances.
There are many people around the world who have been displaced because of natural disasters, food insecurities, and other hardships, but international law, rightly or wrongly, only recognizes those fleeing conflict and violence as refugees.
So what happens when someone flees their country?
Most refugee journeys are long and perilous with limited access to shelter, water, or food.
Since the departure can be sudden and unexpected, belongings might be left behind, and people who are evading conflict often do not have the required documents, like visas, to board airplanes and legally enter other countries.
Financial and political factors can also prevent them from traveling by standard routes.
This means they can usually only travel by land or sea, and may need to entrust their lives to smugglers to help them cross borders.
Whereas some people seek safety with their families, others attempt passage alone and leave their loved ones behind with the hopes of being reunited later.
This separation can be traumatic and unbearably long.
While more than half the world's refugees are in cities, sometimes the first stop for a person fleeing conflict is a refugee camp, usually run by the United Nations Refugee Agency or local governments.
Refugee camps are intended to be temporary structures, offering short-term shelter until inhabitants can safely return home, be integrated to the host country, or resettle in another country.
But resettlement and long-term integration options are often limited.
So many refugees are left with no choice but to remain in camps for years and sometimes even decades.
Once in a new country, the first legal step for a displaced person is to apply for asylum.
At this point, they are an asylum seeker and not officially recognized as a refugee until the application has been accepted.
While countries by and large agree on one definition of refugee, every host country is responsible for examining all requests for asylum and deciding whether applicants can be granted the status of refugee.
Different countries guidelines can vary substantially.
Host countries have several duties towards people they have recognized as refugees, like the guarantee of a minimum standard of treatment and non-discrimination.
The most basic obligation towards refugees is non-refoulement, a principle preventing a nation from sending an individual to a country where their life and freedom are threatened.
In reality, however, refugees are frequently the victims of inconsistent and discriminatory treatment.
They're increasingly obliged to rebuild their lives in the face of xenophobia and racism.
And all too often, they aren't permitted to enter the work force and are fully dependent on humanitarian aid.
In addition, far too many refugee children are out of school due to lack of funding for education programs.
If you go back in your own family history, chances are you will discover that at a certain point, your ancestors were forced from their homes, either escaping a war or fleeing discrimination and persecution.
It would be good of us to remember their stories when we hear of refugees currently displaced, searching for a new home.
Your Brain on Food If you sucked all of the moisture out of your brain and broke it down to its constituent nutritional content, what would it look like?
Most of the weight of your dehydrated brain would come from fats, also known as lipids.
In the remaining brain matter, you would find proteins and amino acids, traces of micronutrients, and glucose.
The brain is, of course, more than just the sum of its nutritional parts, but each component does have a distinct impact on functioning, development, mood, and energy.
So that post-lunch apathy, or late-night alertness you might be feeling, well, that could simply be the effects of food on your brain.
Of the fats in your brain, the superstars are omegas 3 and 6.
These essential fatty acids, which have been linked to preventing degenerative brain conditions, must come from our diets.
So eating omega-rich foods, like nuts, seeds, and fatty fish, is crucial to the creation and maintenance of cell membranes.
And while omegas are good fats for your brain, long-term consumption of other fats, like trans and saturated fats, may compromise brain health.
Meanwhile, proteins and amino acids, the building block nutrients of growth and development, manipulate how we feel and behave.
Amino acids contain the precursors to neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers that carry signals between neurons, affecting things like mood, sleep, attentiveness, and weight.
They're one of the reasons we might feel calm after eating a large plate of pasta, or more alert after a protein-rich meal.
The complex combinations of compounds in food can stimulate brain cells to release mood-altering norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin.
But getting to your brain cells is tricky, and amino acids have to compete for limited access.
A diet with a range of foods helps maintain a balanced combination of brain messengers, and keeps your mood from getting skewed in one direction or the other.
Like the other organs in our bodies, our brains also benefit from a steady supply of micronutrients.
Antioxidants in fruits and vegetables strengthen the brain to fight off free radicals that destroy brain cells, enabling your brain to work well for a longer period of time.
And without powerful micronutrients, like the vitamins B6, B12, and folic acid, our brains would be susceptible to brain disease and mental decline.
Trace amounts of the minerals iron, copper, zinc, and sodium are also fundamental to brain health and early cognitive development.
In order for the brain to efficiently transform and synthesize these valuable nutrients, it needs fuel, and lots of it.
While the human brain only makes up about 2% of our body weight, it uses up to 20% of our energy resources.
Most of this energy comes from carbohydrates that our body digests into glucose, or blood sugar.
The frontal lobes are so sensitive to drops in glucose, in fact, that a change in mental function is one of the primary signals of nutrient deficiency.
Assuming that we are getting glucose regularly, how does the specific type of carbohydrates we eat affect our brains?
Carbs come in three forms: starch, sugar, and fiber.
While on most nutrition labels, they are all lumped into one total carb count, the ratio of the sugar and fiber subgroups to the whole amount affect how the body and brain respond.
A high glycemic food, like white bread, causes a rapid release of glucose into the blood, and then comes the dip.
Blood sugar shoots down, and with it, our attention span and mood.
On the other hand, oats, grains, and legumes have slower glucose release, enabling a steadier level of attentiveness.
For sustained brain power, opting for a varied diet of nutrient-rich foods is critical.
When it comes to what you bite, chew, and swallow, your choices have a direct and long-lasting effect on the most powerful organ in your body.
If you've had surgery, you might remember starting to count backwards from ten, nine, eight, and then waking up with the surgery already over before you even got to five.
And it might seem like you were asleep, but you weren't.
You were under anesthesia, which is much more complicated.
You were unconscious, but you also couldn't move, form memories, or, hopefully, feel pain.
Without being able to block all those processes at once, many surgeries would be way too traumatic to perform.
Ancient medical texts from Egypt, Asia and the Middle East all describe early anesthetics containing things like opium poppy, mandrake fruit, and alcohol.
Today, anesthesiologists often combine regional, inhalational and intravenous agents to get the right balance for a surgery.
Regional anesthesia blocks pain signals from a specific part of the body from getting to the brain.
Pain and other messages travel through the nervous system as electrical impulses.
Regional anesthetics work by setting up an electrical barricade.
They bind to the proteins in neurons' cell membranes that let charged particles in and out, and lock out positively charged particles.
One compound that does this is cocaine, whose painkilling effects were discovered by accident when an ophthalmology intern got some on his tongue.
It's still occasionally used as an anesthetic, but many of the more common regional anesthetics have a similar chemical structure and work the same way.
But for major surgeries where you need to be unconscious, you'll want something that acts on the entire nervous system, including the brain.
That's what inhalational anesthetics do.
In Western medicine, diethyl ether was the first common one.
It was best known as a recreational drug until doctors started to realize that people sometimes didn't notice injuries they received under the influence.
In the 1840s, they started sedating patients with ether during dental extractions and surgeries.
Nitrous oxide became popular in the decades that followed and is still used today.
although ether derivatives, like sevoflurane, are more common.
Inhalational anesthesia is usually supplemented with intravenous anesthesia, which was developed in the 1870s.
Common intravenous agents include sedatives, like propofol, which induce unconsciousness, and opioids, like fentanyl, which reduce pain.
These general anesthetics also seem to work by affecting electrical signals in the nervous system.
Normally, the brain's electrical signals are a chaotic chorus as different parts of the brain communicate with each other.
That connectivity keeps you awake and aware.
But as someone becomes anesthetized, those signals become calmer and more organized, suggesting that different parts of the brain aren't talking to each other anymore.
There's a lot we still don't know about exactly how this happens.
Several common anesthetics bind to the GABA-A receptor in the brain's neurons.
They hold the gateway open, letting negatively charged particles flow into the cell.
Negative charge builds up and acts like a log jam, keeping the neuron from transmitting electrical signals.
The nervous system has lots of these gated channels, controlling pathways for movement, memory, and consciousness.
Most anesthetics probably act on more than one, and they don't act on just the nervous system.
Many anesthetics also affect the heart, lungs, and other vital organs.
Just like early anesthetics, which included familiar poisons like hemlock and aconite, modern drugs can have serious side effects.
So an anesthesiologist has to mix just the right balance of drugs to create all the features of anesthesia, while carefully monitoring the patient's vital signs, and adjusting the drug mixture as needed.
Anesthesia is complicated, but figuring out how to use it allowed for the development of new and better surgical techniques.
Surgeons could learn how to routinely and safely perform C-sections, reopen blocked arteries, replace damaged livers and kidneys, and many other life-saving operations.
And each year, new anesthesia techniques are developed that will ensure more and more patients survive the trauma of surgery.
So you go to the doctor and get some tests.
The doctor determines that you have high cholesterol and you would benefit from medication to treat it.
So you get a pillbox.
You have some confidence, your physician has some confidence that this is going to work.
The company that invented it did a lot of studies, submitted it to the FDA.
They studied it very carefully, skeptically, they approved it.
They have a rough idea of how it works, they have a rough idea of what the side effects are.
It should be OK.
You have a little more of a conversation with your physician and the physician is a little worried because you've been blue, haven't felt like yourself, you haven't been able to enjoy things in life quite as much as you usually do.
Your physician says, "You know, I think you have some depression.
I'm going to have to give you another pill."
So now we're talking about two medications.
This pill also -- millions of people have taken it, the company did studies, the FDA looked at it -- all good.
Think things should go OK.
Think things should go OK.
Well, wait a minute.
How much have we studied these two together?
Well, it's very hard to do that.
In fact, it's not traditionally done.
We totally depend on what we call "post-marketing surveillance," after the drugs hit the market.
How can we figure out if bad things are happening between two medications?
Three? Five? Seven?
Ask your favorite person who has several diagnoses how many medications they're on.
Why do I care about this problem?
I care about it deeply.
I'm an informatics and data science guy and really, in my opinion, the only hope -- only hope -- to understand these interactions is to leverage lots of different sources of data in order to figure out when drugs can be used together safely and when it's not so safe.
So let me tell you a data science story.
And it begins with my student Nick.
Let's call him "Nick," because that's his name.
(Laughter) Nick was a young student.
I said, "You know, Nick, we have to understand how drugs work and how they work together and how they work separately, and we don't have a great understanding.
But the FDA has made available an amazing database.
It's a database of adverse events.
They literally put on the web -- publicly available, you could all download it right now -- hundreds of thousands of adverse event reports from patients, doctors, companies, pharmacists.
And these reports are pretty simple: it has all the diseases that the patient has, all the drugs that they're on, and all the adverse events, or side effects, that they experience.
It is not all of the adverse events that are occurring in America today, but it's hundreds and hundreds of thousands of drugs.
So I said to Nick, "Let's think about glucose.
Glucose is very important, and we know it's involved with diabetes.
Let's see if we can understand glucose response.
I sent Nick off. Nick came back.
"Russ," he said, "I've created a classifier that can look at the side effects of a drug based on looking at this database, and can tell you whether that drug is likely to change glucose or not."
He did it. It was very simple, in a way.
He took all the drugs that were known to change glucose and a bunch of drugs that don't change glucose, and said, "What's the difference in their side effects?
Differences in fatigue? In appetite? In urination habits?"
All those things conspired to give him a really good predictor.
He said, "Russ, I can predict with 93 percent accuracy when a drug will change glucose."
I said, "Nick, that's great."
He's a young student, you have to build his confidence.
"But Nick, there's a problem.
It's that every physician in the world knows all the drugs that change glucose, because it's core to our practice.
So it's great, good job, but not really that interesting, definitely not publishable."
(Laughter) He said, "I know, Russ. I thought you might say that."
Nick is smart.
"I thought you might say that, so I did one other experiment.
I looked at people in this database who were on two drugs, and I looked for signals similar, glucose-changing signals, for people taking two drugs, where each drug alone did not change glucose, but together I saw a strong signal."
And I said, "Oh! You're clever. Good idea. Show me the list."
And there's a bunch of drugs, not very exciting.
But what caught my eye was, on the list there were two drugs: paroxetine, or Paxil, an antidepressant; and pravastatin, or Pravachol, a cholesterol medication.
And I said, "Huh. There are millions of Americans on those two drugs."
In fact, we learned later, 15 million Americans on paroxetine at the time, 15 million on pravastatin, and a million, we estimated, on both.
So that's a million people who might be having some problems with their glucose if this machine-learning mumbo jumbo that he did in the FDA database actually holds up.
But I said, "It's still not publishable, because I love what you did with the mumbo jumbo, with the machine learning, but it's not really standard-of-proof evidence that we have."
So we have to do something else.
Let's go into the Stanford electronic medical record.
We have a copy of it that's OK for research, we removed identifying information.
And I said, "Let's see if people on these two drugs have problems with their glucose."
Now there are thousands and thousands of people in the Stanford medical records that take paroxetine and pravastatin.
But we needed special patients.
We needed patients who were on one of them and had a glucose measurement, then got the second one and had another glucose measurement, all within a reasonable period of time -- something like two months.
And when we did that, we found 10 patients.
However, eight out of the 10 had a bump in their glucose when they got the second P -- we call this P and P -- when they got the second P.
Either one could be first, the second one comes up, glucose went up 20 milligrams per deciliter.
Just as a reminder, you walk around normally, if you're not diabetic, with a glucose of around 90.
And if it gets up to 120, 125, your doctor begins to think about a potential diagnosis of diabetes.
So a 20 bump -- pretty significant.
I said, "Nick, this is very cool.
But, I'm sorry, we still don't have a paper, because this is 10 patients and -- give me a break -- it's not enough patients."
So we said, what can we do?
And we said, let's call our friends at Harvard and Vanderbilt, who also -- Harvard in Boston, Vanderbilt in Nashville, who also have electronic medical records similar to ours.
Let's see if they can find similar patients with the one P, the other P, the glucose measurements in that range that we need.
God bless them, Vanderbilt in one week found 40 such patients, same trend.
Harvard found 100 patients, same trend.
So at the end, we had 150 patients from three diverse medical centers that were telling us that patients getting these two drugs were having their glucose bump somewhat significantly.
More interestingly, we had left out diabetics, because diabetics already have messed up glucose.
When we looked at the glucose of diabetics, it was going up 60 milligrams per deciliter, not just 20.
This was a big deal, and we said, "We've got to publish this."
It was all data evidence, data from the FDA, data from Stanford, data from Vanderbilt, data from Harvard.
We had not done a single real experiment.
But we were nervous.
So Nick, while the paper was in review, went to the lab.
We found somebody who knew about lab stuff.
I don't do that.
I take care of patients, but I don't do pipettes.
They taught us how to feed mice drugs.
We took mice and we gave them one P, paroxetine.
We gave some other mice pravastatin.
And we gave a third group of mice both of them.
And lo and behold, glucose went up 20 to 60 milligrams per deciliter in the mice.
So the paper was accepted based on the informatics evidence alone, but we added a little note at the end, saying, oh by the way, if you give these to mice, it goes up.
That was great, and the story could have ended there.
But I still have six and a half minutes.
(Laughter) So we were sitting around thinking about all of this, and I don't remember who thought of it, but somebody said, "I wonder if patients who are taking these two drugs are noticing side effects of hyperglycemia.
They could and they should.
How would we ever determine that?"
We said, well, what do you do?
You're taking a medication, one new medication or two, and you get a funny feeling.
What do you do?
You go to Google and type in the two drugs you're taking or the one drug you're taking, and you type in "side effects."
So we said OK, let's ask Google if they will share their search logs with us, so that we can look at the search logs and see if patients are doing these kinds of searches.
Google, I am sorry to say, denied our request.
So I was bummed.
I was at a dinner with a colleague who works at Microsoft Research and I said, "We wanted to do this study, Google said no, it's kind of a bummer."
He said, "Well, we have the Bing searches."
(Laughter) Yeah.
That's great.
Now I felt like I was -- (Laughter) I felt like I was talking to Nick again.
He works for one of the largest companies in the world, and I'm already trying to make him feel better.
But he said, "No, Russ -- you might not understand.
We not only have Bing searches, but if you use Internet Explorer to do searches at Google, Yahoo, Bing, any ...
Then, for 18 months, we keep that data for research purposes only."
I said, "Now you're talking!"
This was Eric Horvitz, my friend at Microsoft.
So we did a study where we defined 50 words that a regular person might type in if they're having hyperglycemia, like "fatigue," "loss of appetite," "urinating a lot," "peeing a lot" -- forgive me, but that's one of the things you might type in.
So we had 50 phrases that we called the "diabetes words."
And we did first a baseline.
And it turns out that about .5 to one percent of all searches on the Internet involve one of those words.
So that's our baseline rate.
If people type in "paroxetine" or "Paxil" -- those are synonyms -- and one of those words, the rate goes up to about two percent of diabetes-type words, if you already know that there's that "paroxetine" word.
If it's "pravastatin," the rate goes up to about three percent from the baseline.
If both "paroxetine" and "pravastatin" are present in the query, it goes up to 10 percent, a huge three- to four-fold increase in those searches with the two drugs that we were interested in, and diabetes-type words or hyperglycemia-type words.
We published this, and it got some attention.
The reason it deserves attention is that patients are telling us their side effects indirectly through their searches.
We brought this to the attention of the FDA.
They were interested.
They have set up social media surveillance programs to collaborate with Microsoft, which had a nice infrastructure for doing this, and others, to look at Twitter feeds, to look at Facebook feeds, to look at search logs, to try to see early signs that drugs, either individually or together, are causing problems.
What do I take from this? Why tell this story?
Well, first of all, we have now the promise of big data and medium-sized data to help us understand drug interactions and really, fundamentally, drug actions.
How do drugs work?
This will create and has created a new ecosystem for understanding how drugs work and to optimize their use.
Nick went on; he's a professor at Columbia now.
He did this in his PhD for hundreds of pairs of drugs.
He found several very important interactions, and so we replicated this and we showed that this is a way that really works for finding drug-drug interactions.
However, there's a couple of things.
We don't just use pairs of drugs at a time.
As I said before, there are patients on three, five, seven, nine drugs.
Have they been studied with respect to their nine-way interaction?
Yes, we can do pair-wise, A and B, A and C, A and D, but what about A, B, C, D, E, F, G all together, being taken by the same patient, perhaps interacting with each other in ways that either makes them more effective or less effective or causes side effects that are unexpected?
We really have no idea.
It's a blue sky, open field for us to use data to try to understand the interaction of drugs.
Two more lessons: I want you to think about the power that we were able to generate with the data from people who had volunteered their adverse reactions through their pharmacists, through themselves, through their doctors, the people who allowed the databases at Stanford, Harvard, Vanderbilt, to be used for research.
People are worried about data.
They're worried about their privacy and security -- they should be.
We need secure systems.
But we can't have a system that closes that data off, because it is too rich of a source of inspiration, innovation and discovery for new things in medicine.
And the final thing I want to say is, in this case we found two drugs and it was a little bit of a sad story.
The two drugs actually caused problems.
They increased glucose.
They could throw somebody into diabetes who would otherwise not be in diabetes, and so you would want to use the two drugs very carefully together, perhaps not together, make different choices when you're prescribing.
But there was another possibility.
We could have found two drugs or three drugs that were interacting in a beneficial way.
We could have found new effects of drugs that neither of them has alone, but together, instead of causing a side effect, they could be a new and novel treatment for diseases that don't have treatments or where the treatments are not effective.
If we think about drug treatment today, all the major breakthroughs -- for HIV, for tuberculosis, for depression, for diabetes -- it's always a cocktail of drugs.
And so the upside here, and the subject for a different TED Talk on a different day, is how can we use the same data sources to find good effects of drugs in combination that will provide us new treatments, new insights into how drugs work and enable us to take care of our patients even better?
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
The victory of the underdog over the favored team.
The last minute penalty shot that wins the tournament.
The high-energy training montages.
Many people love to glorify victory on the playing field, cheer for favorite teams, and play sports.
But here's a question: Should we be so obsessed with sports?
Is playing sports actually as good for us as we make it out to be, or just a fun and entertaining pastime?
What does science have to say?
First of all, it's well accepted that exercise is good for our bodies and minds, and that's definitely true.
Exercising, especially when we're young, has all sorts of health benefits, like strengthening our bones, clearing out bad cholesterol from our arteries, and decreasing the risk of stroke, high blood pressure, and diabetes.
Our brains also release a number of chemicals when we workout, including endorphins.
These natural hormones, which control pain and pleasure responses in the cental nervous system, can lead to feelings of euphoria, or, what's often called, a runner's high.
Increased endorphins and consistent physical activity in general can sharpen your focus and improve your mood and memory.
So does that mean we get just as much benefit going to the gym five days a week as we would joining a team and competing?
Well, here's where it gets interesting: because it turns out that if you can find a sport and a team you like, studies show that there are all sorts of benefits that go beyond the physical and mental benefits of exercise alone.
Some of the most significant are psychological benefits, both in the short and long term.
Some of those come from the communal experience of being on a team, for instance, learning to trust and depend on others, to accept help, to give help, and to work together towards a common goal.
In addition, commitment to a team and doing something fun can also make it easier to establish a regular habit of exercise.
School sport participation has also been shown to reduce the risk of suffering from depression for up to four years.
Meanwhile, your self-esteem and confidence can get a big boost.
There are a few reasons for that.
One is found in training.
Just by working and working at skills, especially with a good coach, you reinforce a growth mindset within yourself.
That's when you say, "Even if I can't do something today, I can improve myself through practice and achieve it eventually."
That mindset is useful in all walks of life.
And then there's learning through failure, one of the most transformative, long-term benefits of playing sports.
The experience of coming to terms with defeat can build the resilience and self-awareness necessary to manage academic, social, and physical hurdles.
So even if your team isn't winning all the time, or at all, there's a real benefit to your experience.
Now, not everyone will enjoy every sport.
Perhaps one team is too competitive, or not competitive enough.
It can also take time to find a sport that plays to your strengths.
That's completely okay.
But if you spend some time looking, you'll be able to find a sport that fits your individual needs, and if you do, there are so many benefits.
You'll be a part of a supportive community, you'll be building your confidence, you'll be exercising your body, and you'll be nurturing your mind, not to mention having fun.
The most basic function of bodily fat is self-storage of food reserves.
In prehistoric times, natural selection favored genotypes that could endure harsh conditions by stocking the most fat.
With chronic malnutrition being the norm for most of human history, genetics evolved to favor fat storage.
So when did body fat become problematic?
The negative impacts of being overweight were not even noted in medical literature until as late as the 18th century.
Then, technological advances coupled with public health measures resulted in the betterment of the quantity, quality, and variety of food.
Sustained abundance of good food enabled a healthier population to boom economically.
Output increased, and with it, leisure time and waistlines.
By the mid 19th century, being excessively overweight, or obese, was recognized as a cause of ill health, and another century later, declared deadly.
What is the distinction between being overweight and being obese?
A calculation called the BMI breaks it down for us.
For example, if someone weighs 65 kilgorams and is 1.5 meters tall, they have a BMI of about 29.
Obesity is a condition of excess body fat that occurs when a person's BMI is above 30, just over the overweight range of 25 to 29.9.
While BMI can be a helpful estimate of healthy weight, actual body fat percentage can only really be determined by also considering information like waist circumference and muscle mass.
Athletes, for instance, have a naturally higher BMI.
So how does a person become obese?
At its most basic, obesity is caused by energy imbalance.
If the energy input from calories is greater than the energy output from physical activity, the body stores the extra calories as fat.
In most cases, this imbalance comes from a combination of circumstances and choices.
Adults should be getting at least 2.5 hours of exercise each week, and children a whole hour per day.
But globally, one in four adults and eight out of ten adolescents aren't active enough.
Calorie-dense processed foods and growing portion sizes coupled with pervasive marketing lead to passive overeating.
And scarce resources, and a lack of access to healthy, affordable foods creates an even greater risk in disadvantaged communities.
Yet, our genetic makeup also plays a part.
Studies on families and on separated twins have shown a clear causal hereditary relationship to weight gain.
Recent studies have also found a link between obesity and variations in the bacteria species that live in our digestive systems.
No matter the cause, obesity is an escalating global epidemic.
It substantially raises the probability of diseases, like diabetes, heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, and cancer.
It affects virtually all ages, genders, and socioeconomic groups in both developed and developing countries.
With a 60% rise in child obesity globally over just two decades, the problem is too significant to ignore.
Once a person is obese, the climb to recovery becomes progressively steeper.
Hormonal and metabolic changes reduce the body's response to overeating.
After losing weight, a formerly overweight person burns less calories doing the same exercises as a person who is naturally the same weight, making it much more difficult to shed the excess fat.
And as people gain weight, damage to signaling pathways makes it increasingly difficult for the brain to measure food intake and fat storage.
There is, however, some evidence that well-monitored, long-term changes in behavior can lead to improvements in obesity-related health issues.
And weight loss from sustained lifestyle changes, or invasive treatments like bariatric surgery, can improve insulin resistance and decrease inflammation.
What was once an advantage for survival is now working against us.
As the world's population continues to slow down and get bigger, moving and consciously eating our way towards a healthier weight is essential to our overall well-being.
And with the epidemic affecting every country in the world for different socioeconomic reasons, obesity cannot be seen as an isolated issue.
More global measures for prevention are essential to manage the weight of the world.
In this dystopian world, your resistance group is humanity's last hope.
Unfortunately, you've all been captured by the tyrannical rulers and brought to the ancient colosseum for their deadly entertainment.
Before you're thrown into the dungeon, you see many numbered hallways leading outside.
But each exit is blocked by an electric barrier with a combination keypad.
You learn that one of you will be allowed to try to escape by passing a challenge while everyone else will be fed to the mutant salamanders the next morning.
With her perfect logical reasoning, Zara is the obvious choice.
You hand her a concealed audio transmitter so that the rest of you can listen along.
As Zara is led away, you hear her footsteps echo through one of the hallways, then stop.
A voice announces that she must enter a code consisting of three positive whole numbers in ascending order, so the second number is greater than or equal to the first, and the third is greater than or equal to the second.
She may ask for up to three clues, but if she makes a wrong guess, or says anything else, she'll be thrown back into the dungeon.
For the first clue, the voice says the product of the three numbers is 36.
When Zara asks for the second clue, it tells her the sum of the numbers is the same as the number of the hallway she entered.
There's a long silence.
You're sure Zara remembers the hallway number, but there's no way for you to know it, and she can't say it outloud.
If Zara could enter the passcode at this point, she would, but instead, she asks for the third clue, and the voice announces that the largest number appears only once in the combination.
Moments later, the buzz of the electric barrier stops for a few seconds, and you realize that Zara has escaped.
Unfortunately, her transmitter is no longer in range, so that's all the information you get.
Can you find the solution?
Pause on the next screen to work out the solution.
3 2 1 You're worried about the fact that you don't know Zara's hallway number, but you decide to start from the beginning anyways.
From the first clue, you work out all of the eight possible combinations that come out to a product of 36.
One of these must be right, but which one?
Now comes the hard part.
Even though you don't know which number you're looking for, you decide to work out the sum of each combination's three numbers.
That's when it hits you.
All but two of the sums are unique, and if the hallway number had matched any of these, Zara would have known the correct combination right then and there without asking for the third clue.
Since she did ask for the clue, the hallway number must have matched the only sum that appears more than once in the list: thirteen.
But which of the two combinations that add up to thirteen is correct: 1,6,6, or 2,2,9?
That's where the third clue comes in.
Since it tells us that the largest number must be unique, 2,2,9 must be the code.
When night falls, you and the others escape through hallway thirteen and rejoin Zara outside.
You've freed yourselves through math and logic.
Now it's time to free the rest of the world.
What does the French Revolution have to do with the time NASA accidentally crashed a $200 million orbiter into the surface of Mars?
Actually, everything.
That crash happened due to an error in converting between two measurement systems, U.S. customary units and their S.I, or metric, equivalence.
So what's the connection to the French Revolution?
Let's explain.
For the majority of recorded human history, units like the weight of a grain or the length of a hand weren't exact and varied from place to place.
And different regions didn't just use varying measurements.
They had completely different number systems as well.
By the late Middle Ages, the Hindu-Arabic decimal system mostly replaced Roman numerals and fractions in Europe, but efforts by scholars like John Wilkins to promote standard decimal-based measures were less successful.
With a quarter million different units in France alone, any widespread change would require massive disruption.
And in 1789, that disruption came.
The leaders of the French Revolution didn't just overthrow the monarchy.
They sought to completely transform society according to the rational principles of the Enlightenment.
When the new government took power, the Academy of Sciences convened to reform the system of measurements.
Old standards based on arbitrary authority or local traditions were replaced with mathematical and natural relationships.
For example, the meter, from the Greek word for measure, was defined as 1/10,000,000 between the Equator and North Pole.
And the new metric system was, in the words of the Marquis de Condorcet, "For all people, for all time."
Standardizing measurements had political advantages for the Revolutionaries as well.
Nobles could no longer manipulate local units to extract more rent from commoners, while the government could collect taxes more efficiently.
And switching to a new Republican Calendar with ten-day weeks reduced church power by eliminating Sundays.
Adoption of this new system wasn't easy.
In fact, it was a bit of a mess.
At first, people used new units alongside old ones, and the Republican Calendar was eventually abandoned.
When Napoléon Bonaparte took power, he allowed small businesses to use traditional measurements redefined in metric terms.
But the metric system remained standard for formal use, and it spread across the continent, along with France's borders.
While Napoléon's empire lasted eight years, its legacy endured far longer.
Some European countries reverted to old measurements upon independence.
Others realized the value of standardization in an age of international trade.
After Portugal and the Netherlands switched to metric voluntarily, other nations followed, with colonial empires spreading the system around the world.
As France's main rival, Britain had resisted revolutionary ideas and retained its traditional units.
But over the next two centuries, the British Empire slowly transitioned, first approving the metric system as an optional alternative before gradually making it offical.
However, this switch came too late for thirteen former colonies that had already gained independence.
The United States of America stuck with the English units of its colonial past and today remains one of only three countries which haven't fully embraced the metric system.
Despite constant initiatives for metrication, many Americans consider units like feet and pounds more intuitive.
And ironically, some regard the once revolutionary metric system as a symbol of global conformity.
Nevertheless, the metric system is almost universally used in science and medicine, and it continues to evolve according to its original principles.
For a long time, standard units were actually defined by carefully maintained physical prototypes.
But thanks to improving technology and precision, these objects with limited access and unreliable longevity are now being replaced with standards based on universal constants, like the speed of light.
Consistent measurements are such an integral part of our daily lives that it's hard to appreciate what a major accomplishment for humanity they've been.
And just as it arose from a political revolution, the metric system remains crucial for the scientific revolutions to come.
I'm a textile artist most widely known for starting the yarn bombing movement.
Yarn bombing is when you take knitted or crocheted material out into the urban environment, graffiti-style -- or, more specifically, without permission and unsanctioned.
But when I started this over 10 years ago, I didn't have a word for it, I didn't have any ambitious notions about it, I had no visions of grandeur.
All I wanted to see was something warm and fuzzy and human-like on the cold, steel, gray facade that I looked at everyday.
So I wrapped the door handle.
I call this the Alpha Piece.
Little did I know that this tiny piece would change the course of my life.
So clearly the reaction was interesting.
It intrigued me and I thought, "What else could I do?"
Could I do something in the public domain that would get the same reaction?
So I wrapped the stop sign pole near my house.
The reaction was wild.
People would park their cars and get out of their cars and stare at it, and scratch their heads and stare at it, and take pictures of it and take pictures next to it, and all of that was really exciting to me and I wanted to do every stop sign pole in the neighborhood.
And the more that I did, the stronger the reaction.
So at this point I'm smitten.
I'm hooked.
This was all seductive.
I found my new passion and the urban environment was my playground.
So this is some of my early work.
I was very curious about this idea of enhancing the ordinary, the mundane, even the ugly, and not taking away its identity or its functionality but just giving it a well-tailored suit out of knitting.
And this was fun for me.
It was really fun to take inanimate objects and have them come to life.
So ...
I think we all see the humor in this, but -- (Laughter) I was at a point where I wanted to take it seriously.
I wanted to analyze it.
I wanted to know why I was letting this take over my life, why I was passionate about it, why were other people reacting so strongly to it.
And I realized something.
We all live in this fast-paced, digital world, but we still crave and desire something that's relatable.
I think we've all become desensitized by our overdeveloped cities that we live in, and billboards and advertisements, and giant parking lots, and we don't even complain about that stuff anymore.
So when you stumble upon a stop sign pole that's wrapped in knitting and it seems so out of place and then gradually -- weirdly -- you find a connection to it, that is the moment.
That is the moment I love and that is the moment I love to share with others.
So at this point, my curiosity grew.
It went from the fire hydrants and the stop sign poles to what else can I do with this material.
Can I do something big and large-scale and insurmountable?
So that's when the bus happened.
This was a real game changer for me.
I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for this one.
At this point, people were recognizing my work but there wasn't much out there that was wrapped in knitting that was large-scale, and this definitely was the first city bus to be wrapped in knitting.
So at this point, I'm experiencing, or I'm witnessing something interesting.
I may have started yarn bombing but I certainly don't own it anymore.
It had reached global status.
People from all over the world were doing this.
And I know this because I would travel to certain parts of the world that I'd never been to, and I'd stumble upon a stop sign pole and I knew I didn't wrap it.
So as I pursued my own goals with my art -- this is a lot of my recent work -- so was yarn bombing.
And that experience showed me the hidden power of this craft and showed me that there was this common language I had with the rest of the world.
It was through this granny hobby -- this unassuming hobby -- that I found commonality with people that I never thought I'd have a connection with.
So as I tell my story today, I'd also like to convey to you that hidden power can be found in the most unassuming places, and we all possess skills that are just waiting to be discovered.
If you think about our hands, these tools that are connected to us, and what they're capable of doing -- building houses and furniture, and painting giant murals -- and most of the time we hold a controller or a cell phone.
And I'm totally guilty of this as well.
But if you think about it, what would happen if you put those things down?
What would you make? What would you create with your own hands?
A lot of people think that I am a master knitter but I actually couldn't knit a sweater to save my life.
But I did something interesting with knitting that had never been done before.
I also wasn't "supposed to be" an artist in the sense that I wasn't formally trained to do this -- I'm a math major actually.
So I didn't think this was in the cards for me, but I also know that I didn't stumble upon this.
And when this happened to me, I held on tight, I fought for it and I'm proud to say that I am a working artist today.
So as we ponder the future, know that your future might not be so seamless.
And one day, you might be as bored as I was and knit a door handle to change your world forever.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Charles Osborne began to hiccup in 1922 after a hog fell on top of him.
He wasn't cured until 68 years later and is now listed by Guinness as the world record holder for hiccup longevity.
Meanwhile, Florida teen Jennifer Mee may hold the record for the most frequent hiccups, 50 times per minute for more than four weeks in 2007.
So what causes hiccups?
Doctors point out that a round of hiccups often follows from stimuli that stretch the stomach, like swallowing air or too rapid eating or drinking.
Others associate hiccups with intense emotions or a response to them: laughing, sobbing, anxiety, and excitement.
Let's look at what happens when we hiccup.
It begins with an involuntary spasm or sudden contraction of the diaphragm, the large dome-shaped muscle below our lungs that we use to inhale air.
This is followed almost immediately by the sudden closure of the vocal chords and the opening between them, which is called the glottis.
The movement of the diaphragm initiates a sudden intake of air, but the closure of the vocal chords stops it from entering the wind pipe and reaching the lungs.
It also creates the characteristic sound: "hic."
To date, there is no known function for hiccups.
They don't seem to provide any medical or physiological advantage.
Why begin to inhale air only to suddenly stop it from actually entering the lungs?
Anatomical structures, or physiological mechanisms, with no apparent purpose present challenges to evolutionary biologists.
Do such structures serve some hidden function that hasn't yet been discovered?
Or are they relics of our evolutionary past, having once served some important purpose only to persist into the present as vestigial remnants?
One idea is that hiccups began many millions of years before the appearance of humans.
The lung is thought to have evolved as a structure to allow early fish, many of which lived in warm, stagnant water with little oxygen, to take advantage of the abundant oxygen in the air overhead.
When descendants of these animals later moved onto land, they moved from gill-based ventilation to air-breathing with lungs.
That's similar to the much more rapid changes faced by frogs today as they transition from tadpoles with gills to adults with lungs.
This hypothesis suggests that the hiccup is a relic of the ancient transition from water to land.
An inhalation that could move water over gills followed by a rapid closure of the glottis preventing water from entering the lungs.
That's supported by evidence which suggests that the neural patterning involved in generating a hiccup is almost identical to that responsible for respiration in amphibians.
Another group of scientists believe that the reflex is retained in us today because it actually provides an important advantage.
They point out that true hiccups are found only in mammals and that they're not retained in birds, lizards, turtles, or any other exclusively air-breathing animals.
Further, hiccups appear in human babies long before birth and are far more common in infants that adults.
Their explanation for this involves the uniquely mammalian activity of nursing.
The ancient hiccup reflex may have been adapted by mammals to help remove air from the stomach as a sort of glorified burp.
The sudden expansion of the diaphragm would raise air from the stomach, while a closure of the glottis would prevent milk from entering the lungs.
Sometimes, a bout of hiccups will go on and on, and we try home remedies: sipping continuously from a glass of cold water, holding one's breath, a mouthful of honey or peanut butter, breathing into a paper bag, or being suddenly frightened.
Unfortunately, scientists have yet to verify that any one cure works better or more consistently than others.
However, we do know one thing that definitely doesn't work.
Imagine you're on a game show, and you can choose between two prizes: a diamond or a bottle of water.
It's an easy choice.
The diamonds are clearly more valuable.
Now imagine being given the same choice again, only this time, you're not on a game show, but dehydrated in the desert after wandering for days.
Do you choose differently?
Why? Aren't diamonds still more valuable?
This is the paradox of value, famously described by pioneering economist Adam Smith.
And what it tells us is that defining value is not as simple as it seems.
On the game show, you were thinking about each item's exchange value, what you could obtain for them at a later time, but in an emergency, like the desert scenario, what matters far more is their use value, how helpful they are in your current situation.
And because we only get to choose one of the options, we also have to consider its opportunity cost, or what we lose by giving up the other choice.
After all, it doesn't matter how much you could get from selling the diamond if you never make it out of the desert.
Most modern economists deal with the paradox of value by attempting to unify these considerations under the concept of utility, how well something satisfies a person's wants or needs.
Utility can apply to anything from the basic need for food to the pleasure of hearing a favorite song, and will naturally vary for different people and circumstances.
A market economy provides us with an easy way to track utility.
Put simply, the utility something has to you is reflected by how much you'd be willing to pay for it.
Now, imagine yourself back in the desert, only this time, you get offered a new diamond or a fresh bottle of water every five minutes.
If you're like most people, you'll first choose enough water to last the trip, and then as many diamonds as you can carry.
This is because of something called marginal utility, and it means that when you choose between diamonds and water, you compare utility obtained from every additional bottle of water to every additional diamond.
And you do this each time an offer is made.
The first bottle of water is worth more to you than any amount of diamonds, but eventually, you have all the water you need.
After a while, every additional bottle becomes a burden.
That's when you begin to choose diamonds over water.
And it's not just necessities like water.
When it comes to most things, the more of it you acquire, the less useful or enjoyable every additional bit becomes.
This is the law of diminishing marginal utility.
You might gladly buy two or three helpings of your favorite food, but the fourth would make you nauseated, and the hundredth would spoil before you could even get to it.
Or you could pay to see the same movie over and over until you got bored of it or spent all of your money.
Either way, you'd eventually reach a point where the marginal utility for buying another movie ticket became zero.
Utility applies not just to buying things, but to all our decisions.
And the intuitive way to maximize it and avoid diminishing returns is to vary the way we spend our time and resources.
After our basic needs are met, we'd theoretically decide to invest in choices only to the point they're useful or enjoyable.
Of course, how effectively any of us manage to maximize utility in real life is another matter.
But it helps to remember that the ultimate source of value comes from us, the needs we share, the things we enjoy, and the choices we make.
So a while ago, I tried an experiment.
For one year, I would say yes to all the things that scared me.
Anything that made me nervous, took me out of my comfort zone, I forced myself to say yes to.
Did I want to speak in public?
No, but yes.
Did I want to be on live TV?
No, but yes.
Did I want to try acting?
No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.
And a crazy thing happened: the very act of doing the thing that scared me undid the fear, made it not scary.
My fear of public speaking, my social anxiety, poof, gone.
It's amazing, the power of one word.
"Yes" changed my life.
"Yes" changed me.
But there was one particular yes that affected my life in the most profound way, in a way I never imagined, and it started with a question from my toddler.
I have these three amazing daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson, and Emerson is a toddler who inexplicably refers to everyone as "honey."
as though she's a Southern waitress.
(Laughter) "Honey, I'm gonna need some milk for my sippy cup."
(Laughter) The Southern waitress asked me to play with her one evening when I was on my way somewhere, and I said, "Yes."
And that yes was the beginning of a new way of life for my family.
I made a vow that from now on, every time one of my children asks me to play, no matter what I'm doing or where I'm going, I say yes, every single time.
Almost. I'm not perfect at it, but I try hard to practice it.
And it's had a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.
But it's also had a stunning side effect, and it wasn't until recently that I fully understood it, that I understood that saying yes to playing with my children likely saved my career.
See, I have what most people would call a dream job.
I'm a writer. I imagine. I make stuff up for a living.
Dream job.
No.
I'm a titan.
Dream job.
I create television. I executive produce television.
I make television, a great deal of television.
In one way or another, this TV season, I'm responsible for bringing about 70 hours of programming to the world.
Four television programs, 70 hours of TV -- (Applause) Three shows in production at a time, sometimes four.
Each show creates hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before.
The budget for one episode of network television can be anywhere from three to six million dollars.
Let's just say five.
A new episode made every nine days times four shows, so every nine days that's 20 million dollars worth of television, four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time, sometimes four, 16 episodes going on at all times: 24 episodes of "Grey's," 21 episodes of "Scandal," 15 episodes of "How To Get Away With Murder," 10 episodes of "The Catch," that's 70 hours of TV, that's 350 million dollars for a season.
In America, my television shows are back to back to back on Thursday night.
Around the world, my shows air in 256 territories in 67 languages for an audience of 30 million people.
My brain is global, and 45 hours of that 70 hours of TV are shows I personally created and not just produced, so on top of everything else, I need to find time, real quiet, creative time, to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.
Four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time, sometimes four, 350 million dollars, campfires burning all over the world.
You know who else is doing that?
Nobody, so like I said, I'm a titan.
Dream job.
(Applause) Now, I don't tell you this to impress you.
I tell you this because I know what you think of when you hear the word "writer."
I tell you this so that all of you out there who work so hard, whether you run a company or a country or a classroom or a store or a home, take me seriously when I talk about working, so you'll get that I don't peck at a computer and imagine all day, so you'll hear me when I say that I understand that a dream job is not about dreaming.
It's all job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat, no tears.
I work a lot, very hard, and I love it.
When I'm hard at work, when I'm deep in it, there is no other feeling.
For me, my work is at all times building a nation out of thin air.
It is manning the troops. It is painting a canvas.
It is hitting every high note. It is running a marathon.
It is being Beyoncé.
And it is all of those things at the same time.
I love working.
It is creative and mechanical and exhausting and exhilarating and hilarious and disturbing and clinical and maternal and cruel and judicious, and what makes it all so good is the hum.
There is some kind of shift inside me when the work gets good.
A hum begins in my brain, and it grows and it grows and that hum sounds like the open road, and I could drive it forever.
And a lot of people, when I try to explain the hum, they assume that I'm talking about the writing, that my writing brings me joy.
And don't get me wrong, it does.
But the hum -- it wasn't until I started making television that I started working, working and making and building and creating and collaborating, that I discovered this thing, this buzz, this rush, this hum.
The hum is more than writing.
The hum is action and activity. The hum is a drug.
The hum is music. The hum is light and air.
The hum is God's whisper right in my ear.
And when you have a hum like that, you can't help but strive for greatness.
That feeling, you can't help but strive for greatness at any cost.
That's called the hum.
Or, maybe it's called being a workaholic.
(Laughter) Maybe it's called genius.
Maybe it's called ego.
Maybe it's just fear of failure.
I don't know.
I just know that I'm not built for failure, and I just know that I love the hum.
I just know that I want to tell you I'm a titan, and I know that I don't want to question it.
But here's the thing: the more successful I become, the more shows, the more episodes, the more barriers broken, the more work there is to do, the more balls in the air, the more eyes on me, the more history stares, the more expectations there are.
The more I work to be successful, the more I need to work.
And what did I say about work?
I love working, right?
The nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running, the troops, the canvas, the high note, the hum, the hum, the hum.
I like that hum. I love that hum.
I need that hum. I am that hum.
Am I nothing but that hum?
And then the hum stopped.
Overworked, overused, overdone, burned out.
The hum stopped.
Now, my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single working titan.
Harper tells people, "My mom won't be there, but you can text my nanny."
And Emerson says, "Honey, I'm wanting to go to ShondaLand."
They're children of a titan.
They're baby titans.
They were 12, 3, and 1 when the hum stopped.
The hum of the engine died.
I stopped loving work. I couldn't restart the engine.
The hum would not come back.
My hum was broken.
I was doing the same things I always did, all the same titan work, 15-hour days, working straight through the weekends, no regrets, never surrender, a titan never sleeps, a titan never quits, full hearts, clear eyes, yada, whatever.
But there was no hum.
Inside me was silence.
Four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time, sometimes four.
I was the perfect titan.
I was a titan you could take home to your mother.
All the colors were the same, and I was no longer having any fun.
And it was my life.
It was all I did.
I was the hum, and the hum was me.
So what do you do when the thing you do, the work you love, starts to taste like dust?
Now, I know somebody's out there thinking, "Cry me a river, stupid writer titan lady."
(Laughter) But you know, you do, if you make, if you work, if you love what you do, being a teacher, being a banker, being a mother, being a painter, being Bill Gates, if you simply love another person and that gives you the hum, if you know the hum, if you know what the hum feels like, if you have been to the hum, when the hum stops, who are you?
What are you?
What am I?
Am I still a titan?
If the song of my heart ceases to play, can I survive in the silence?
And then my Southern waitress toddler asks me a question.
I'm on my way out the door, I'm late, and she says, "Momma, wanna play?"
And I'm just about to say no, when I realize two things.
One, I'm supposed to say yes to everything, and two, my Southern waitress didn't call me "honey."
She's not calling everyone "honey" anymore.
When did that happen?
I'm missing it, being a titan and mourning my hum, and here she is changing right before my eyes.
And so she says, "Momma, wanna play?"
And I say, "Yes."
There's nothing special about it.
We play, and we're joined by her sisters, and there's a lot of laughing, and I give a dramatic reading from the book Everybody Poops.
Nothing out of the ordinary.
(Laughter) And yet, it is extraordinary, because in my pain and my panic, in the homelessness of my humlessness, I have nothing to do but pay attention.
I focus.
I am still.
The nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running, the troops, the canvas, the high note does not exist.
All that exists are sticky fingers and gooey kisses and tiny voices and crayons and that song about letting go of whatever it is that Frozen girl needs to let go of.
(Laughter) It's all peace and simplicity.
The air is so rare in this place for me that I can barely breathe.
I can barely believe I'm breathing.
Play is the opposite of work.
And I am happy.
Something in me loosens.
A door in my brain swings open, and a rush of energy comes.
And it's not instantaneous, but it happens, it does happen.
I feel it.
A hum creeps back.
Not at full volume, barely there, it's quiet, and I have to stay very still to hear it, but it is there.
Not the hum, but a hum.
And now I feel like I know a very magical secret.
Well, let's not get carried away.
It's just love. That's all it is.
No magic. No secret. It's just love.
It's just something we forgot.
The hum, the work hum, the hum of the titan, that's just a replacement.
If I have to ask you who I am, if I have to tell you who I am, if I describe myself in terms of shows and hours of television and how globally badass my brain is, I have forgotten what the real hum is.
The hum is not power and the hum is not work-specific.
The hum is joy-specific.
The real hum is love-specific.
The hum is the electricity that comes from being excited by life.
The real hum is confidence and peace.
The real hum ignores the stare of history, and the balls in the air, and the expectation, and the pressure.
The real hum is singular and original.
The real hum is God's whisper in my ear, but maybe God was whispering the wrong words, because which one of the gods was telling me I was the titan?
It's just love.
We could all use a little more love, a lot more love.
Any time my child asks me to play, I will say yes.
I make it a firm rule for one reason, to give myself permission, to free me from all of my workaholic guilt.
It's a law, so I don't have a choice, and I don't have a choice, not if I want to feel the hum.
I wish it were that easy, but I'm not good at playing.
I don't like it.
I'm not interested in doing it the way I'm interested in doing work.
The truth is incredibly humbling and humiliating to face.
I don't like playing.
I work all the time because I like working.
I like working more than I like being at home.
Facing that fact is incredibly difficult to handle, because what kind of person likes working more than being at home?
Well, me.
I mean, let's be honest, I call myself a titan.
I've got issues.
(Laughter) And one of those issues isn't that I am too relaxed.
(Laughter) We run around the yard, up and back and up and back.
We have 30-second dance parties.
We sing show tunes. We play with balls.
I blow bubbles and they pop them.
And I feel stiff and delirious and confused most of the time.
I itch for my cell phone always.
But it is OK.
My tiny humans show me how to live and the hum of the universe fills me up.
I play and I play until I begin to wonder why we ever stop playing in the first place.
You can do it too, say yes every time your child asks you to play.
Are you thinking that maybe I'm an idiot in diamond shoes?
You're right, but you can still do this.
You have time.
You know why? Because you're not Rihanna and you're not a Muppet.
Your child does not think you're that interesting.
(Laughter) You only need 15 minutes.
My two- and four-year-old only ever want to play with me for about 15 minutes or so before they think to themselves they want to do something else.
It's an amazing 15 minutes, but it's 15 minutes.
If I'm not a ladybug or a piece of candy, I'm invisible after 15 minutes.
(Laughter) And my 13-year-old, if I can get a 13-year-old to talk to me for 15 minutes I'm Parent of the Year.
(Laughter) 15 minutes is all you need.
I can totally pull off 15 minutes of uninterrupted time on my worst day.
Uninterrupted is the key.
No cell phone, no laundry, no anything.
You have a busy life. You have to get dinner on the table.
You have to force them to bathe. But you can do 15 minutes.
My kids are my happy place, they're my world, but it doesn't have to be your kids, the fuel that feeds your hum, the place where life feels more good than not good.
It's not about playing with your kids, it's about joy.
It's about playing in general.
Give yourself the 15 minutes.
Find what makes you feel good.
Just figure it out and play in that arena.
I'm not perfect at it. In fact, I fail as often as I succeed, seeing friends, reading books, staring into space.
"Wanna play?" starts to become shorthand for indulging myself in ways I'd given up on right around the time I got my first TV show, right around the time I became a titan-in-training, right around the time I started competing with myself for ways unknown.
15 minutes? What could be wrong with giving myself my full attention for 15 minutes?
Turns out, nothing.
The very act of not working has made it possible for the hum to return, as if the hum's engine could only refuel while I was away.
Work doesn't work without play.
It takes a little time, but after a few months, one day the floodgates open and there's a rush, and I find myself standing in my office filled with an unfamiliar melody, full on groove inside me, and around me, and it sends me spinning with ideas, and the humming road is open, and I can drive it and drive it, and I love working again.
But now, I like that hum, but I don't love that hum.
I don't need that hum.
I am not that hum. That hum is not me, not anymore.
I am bubbles and sticky fingers and dinners with friends.
I am that hum.
Life's hum.
Love's hum.
Work's hum is still a piece of me, it is just no longer all of me, and I am so grateful.
And I don't give a crap about being a titan, because I have never once seen a titan play Red Rover, Red Rover.
I said yes to less work and more play, and somehow I still run my world.
My brain is still global. My campfires still burn.
The more I play, the happier I am, and the happier my kids are.
The more I play, the more I feel like a good mother.
The more I play, the freer my mind becomes.
The more I play, the better I work.
The more I play, the more I feel the hum, the nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running, the troops, the canvas, the high note, the hum, the hum, the other hum, the real hum, life's hum.
The more I feel that hum, the more this strange, quivering, uncocooned, awkward, brand new, alive non-titan feels like me.
The more I feel that hum, the more I know who I am.
I'm a writer, I make stuff up, I imagine.
That part of the job, that's living the dream.
That's the dream of the job.
Because a dream job should be a little bit dreamy.
I said yes to less work and more play.
Titans need not apply.
Wanna play?
Thank you.
(Applause)
Which is the hardest word to translate in this sentence?
"Know" is easy to translate.
"Pep rally" doesn't have a direct analog in a lot of languages and cultures, but can be approximated.
But the hardest word there is actually one of the smallest: "you."
As simple as it seems, it's often impossible to accurately translate "you" without knowing a lot more about the situation where it's being said.
To start with, how familiar are you with the person you're talking to?
Many cultures have different levels of formality.
A close friend, someone much older or much younger, a stranger, a boss.
These all may be slightly different "you's."
In many languages, the pronoun reflects these differences through what's known as the T–V distinction.
In French, for example, you would say "tu" when talking to your friend at school, but "vous" when addressing your teacher.
Even English once had something similar.
Remember the old-timey "thou?"
Ironically, it was actually the informal pronoun for people you're close with, while "you" was the formal and polite version.
That distinction was lost when the English decided to just be polite all the time.
But the difficulty in translating "you" doesn't end there.
In languages like Hausa or Korana, the "you" form depends on the listener's gender.
In many more, it depends on whether they are one or many, such as with German "Du" or "ihr."
Even in English, some dialects use words like "y'all" or "youse" the same way.
Some plural forms, like the French "vous" and Russian "Вы" are also used for a single person to show that the addressee is that much more important, much like the royal "we."
And a few languages even have a specific form for addressing exactly two people, like Slovenian "vidva."
If that wasn't complicated enough, formality, number, and gender can all come into play at the same time.
In Spanish, "tú" is unisex informal singular, "usted" is unisex formal singular, "vosotros" is masculine informal plural, "vosotras" is feminine informal plural, and "ustedes" is the unisex formal plural.
Phew!
After all that, it may come as a relief that some languages often leave out the second person pronoun.
In languages like Romanian and Portuguese, the pronoun can be dropped from sentences because it's clearly implied by the way the verbs are conjugated.
And in languages like Korean, Thai, and Chinese, pronouns can be dropped without any grammatical hints.
Speakers often would rather have the listener guess the pronoun from context than use the wrong one and risk being seen as rude.
So if you're ever working as a translator and come across this sentence without any context: "You and you, no, not you, you, your job is to translate 'you' for yourselves" ...
Well, good luck.
And to the volunteer community who will be translating this video into multiple languages: Sorry about that!
Here's what has to happen for pregnancy to occur after sexual intercourse.
Sperm must swim up the vagina, through the cervical opening, upwards through the uterus, and into one of the two fallopian tubes.
If an egg, released during that month's ovulation, is in the tube, one sperm has a chance to fertilize it.
Contraceptives are designed to prevent this process, and they work in three basic ways.
They block the sperm, disable sperm before they reach the uterus, or suppress ovulation.
Block is the simplest.
Male and female condoms prevent sperm from coming into contact with the vaginal space.
That barrier is also why they, unlike other contraceptive methods, are able to prevent transmission of certain sexually transmitted diseases.
Meanwhile, the diaphragm, cervical cap, and sponge work by being placed over the cervix, barricading the entrance to the uterus.
These contraceptives are sometimes called barrier methods and can be used with spermicides, an example of the second category, disable.
A spermicide is a chemical that immobilizes and destroys sperm.
Today's spermicides come as foam, cream, jelly, suppositories, and even a thin piece of translucent film that dissolves in the vagina.
These products can be inserted directly into the vagina before intercourse, or can be combined with block methods, like a diaphragm or condom, for added proection.
The third category for preventing pregnancy works by suppressing the action of an egg maturing in the ovary.
If there isn't an egg available in the fallopian tube, there's nothing for sperm to fertilize.
Hormonal contraceptives, including the pill, the patch, the Depo shot, and the vaginal ring all release synthetic versions of various combinations of progesterone and estrogen.
This hormone cocktail suppresses ovulation, keeping the immature egg safely sequestered in the ovary.
Synthetic progesterone also has a block trick up its sleeve.
It makes cervical mucus too thick and sticky for sperm to swim through easily.
There are other contraceptives that use multiple approaches at the same time.
For example, many IUDs, or intrauterine devices, contain synthetic hormones which suppress ovulation.
Some also contain copper, which disable sperm while also making egg implantation in the uterus difficult.
Block, disable, or suppress: is one strategy better than the other?
There are differences, but a lot of it has to do with how convenient and easy it is to use each contraceptive correctly.
For example, male condoms would be about 98% effective if everyone used them perfectly.
That 98% means if 100 couples correctly used condoms for a year, two women would get pregnant.
But not everyone uses them correctly, so they're only 82% effective in practice.
Other methods, like the patch and pill, are 99% effective when they're used perfectly.
But in practice, that's 91%.
Spermicide is only 85% effective, even with perfect usage, and just 71% effective with typical usage.
Another important consideration in the choice of contraceptives are side effects, which almost exclusively affect women rather than men.
Hormonal methods in particular can cause symptoms like headaches, nausea, and high blood pressure, but they vary from woman to woman.
That's why these methods require a prescription from a doctor.
The choice of contraceptive method is a personal one, and what works best for you now may change later.
Scientists also continue to research new methods, such as a male pill that would prevent sperm production.
In the meantime, there are quite a few options to block sperm, disable them, or suppress eggs and keep them out of reach.
How do you get what you want using just your words?
Aristotle set out to answer exactly that question over 2,000 years ago with the Treatise on Rhetoric.
Rhetoric, according to Aristotle, is the art of seeing the available means of persuasion.
And today we apply it to any form of communication.
Aristotle focused on oration, though, and he described three types of persuasive speech.
Forensic, or judicial, rhetoric establishes facts and judgements about the past, similar to detectives at a crime scene.
Epideictic, or demonstrative, rhetoric makes a proclamation about the present situation, as in wedding speeches.
But the way to accomplish change is through deliberative rhetoric, or symbouleutikon.
Rather than the past or the present, deliberative rhetoric focuses on the future.
It's the rhetoric of politicians debating a new law by imagining what effect it might have, like when Ronald Regan warned that the introduction of Medicare would lead to a socialist future spent telling our children and our children's children what it once was like in America when men were free.
But it's also the rhetoric of activists urging change, such as Martin Luther King Jr's dream that his children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.
In both cases, the speaker's present their audience with a possible future and try to enlist their help in avoiding or achieving it.
But what makes for good deliberative rhetoric, besides the future tense?
According to Aristotle, there are three persuasive appeals: ethos, logos, and pathos.
Ethos is how you convince an audience of your credibility.
Winston Churchill began his 1941 address to the U.S. Congress by declaring, "I have been in full harmony all my life with the tides which have flowed on both sides of the Atlantic against privilege and monopoly," thus highlighting his virtue as someone committed to democracy.
Much earlier, in his defense of the poet Archias, Roman consul Cicero appealed to his own practical wisdom and expertise as a politician: "Drawn from my study of the liberal sciences and from that careful training to which I admit that at no part of my life I have ever been disinclined."
And finally, you can demonstrate disinterest, or that you're not motivated by personal gain.
Logos is the use of logic and reason.
This method can employ rhetorical devices such as analogies, examples, and citations of research or statistics.
But it's not just facts and figures.
It's also the structure and content of the speech itself.
The point is to use factual knowledge to convince the audience, as in Sojourner Truth's argument for women's rights: "I have as much muscle as any man and can do as much work as any man.
I have plowed and reaped and husked and chopped and mowed and can any man do more than that?"
Unfortunately, speakers can also manipulate people with false information that the audience thinks is true, such as the debunked but still widely believed claim that vaccines cause autism.
And finally, pathos appeals to emotion, and in our age of mass media, it's often the most effective mode.
Pathos is neither inherently good nor bad, but it may be irrational and unpredictable.
It can just as easily rally people for peace as incite them to war.
Most advertising, from beauty products that promise to relieve our physical insecurities to cars that make us feel powerful, relies on pathos.
Aristotle's rhetorical appeals still remain powerful tools today, but deciding which of them to use is a matter of knowing your audience and purpose, as well as the right place and time.
And perhaps just as important is being able to notice when these same methods of persuasion are being used on you.
1.3 billion years ago, in a distant, distant galaxy, two black holes locked into a spiral, falling inexorably towards each other and collided, converting three Suns' worth of stuff into pure energy in a tenth of a second.
For that brief moment in time, the glow was brighter than all the stars in all the galaxies in all of the known Universe.
It was a very big bang.
But they didn't release their energy in light.
I mean, you know, they're black holes.
All that energy was pumped into the fabric of space and time itself, making the Universe explode in gravitational waves.
Let me give you a sense of the timescale at work here.
1.3 billion years ago, Earth had just managed to evolve multicellular life.
Since then, Earth has made and evolved corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and even -- God save us -- the Internet.
And about 25 years ago, a particularly audacious set of people -- Rai Weiss at MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever at Caltech -- decided that it would be really neat to build a giant laser detector with which to search for the gravitational waves from things like colliding black holes.
Now, most people thought they were nuts.
But enough people realized that they were brilliant nuts that the US National Science Foundation decided to fund their crazy idea.
So after decades of development, construction and imagination and a breathtaking amount of hard work, they built their detector, called LIGO: The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.
For the last several years, LIGO's been undergoing a huge expansion in its accuracy, a tremendous improvement in its detection ability.
It's now called Advanced LIGO as a result.
In early September of 2015, LIGO turned on for a final test run while they sorted out a few lingering details.
And on September 14 of 2015, just days after the detector had gone live, the gravitational waves from those colliding black holes passed through the Earth.
And they passed through you and me.
And they passed through the detector.
(Audio) Scott Hughes: There's two moments in my life more emotionally intense than that.
The other is when I had to say goodbye to my father when he was terminally ill.
You know, it was the payoff of my career, basically.
Everything I'd been working on -- it's no longer science fiction! (Laughs) Allan Adams: So that's my very good friend and collaborator, Scott Hughes, a theoretical physicist at MIT, who has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and the signals that they could impart on observatories like LIGO, for the past 23 years.
So let me take a moment to tell you what I mean by a gravitational wave.
A gravitational wave is a ripple in the shape of space and time.
As the wave passes by, it stretches space and everything in it in one direction, and compresses it in the other.
This has led to countless instructors of general relativity doing a really silly dance to demonstrate in their classes on general relativity.
"It stretches and expands, it stretches and expands."
So the trouble with gravitational waves is that they're very weak; they're preposterously weak.
For example, the waves that hit us on September 14 -- and yes, every single one of you stretched and compressed under the action of that wave -- when the waves hit, they stretched the average person by one part in 10 to the 21.
That's a decimal place, 20 zeroes, and a one.
That's why everyone thought the LIGO people were nuts.
Even with a laser detector five kilometers long -- and that's already crazy -- they would have to measure the length of those detectors to less than one thousandth of the radius of the nucleus of an atom.
And that's preposterous.
So towards the end of his classic text on gravity, LIGO co-founder Kip Thorne described the hunt for gravitational waves as follows: He said, "The technical difficulties to be surmounted in constructing such detectors are enormous.
But physicists are ingenious, and with the support of a broad lay public, all obstacles will surely be overcome."
Thorne published that in 1973, 42 years before he succeeded.
Now, coming back to LIGO, Scott likes to say that LIGO acts like an ear more than it does like an eye.
I want to explain what that means.
Visible light has a wavelength, a size, that's much smaller than the things around you, the features on people's faces, the size of your cell phone.
And that's really useful, because it lets you make an image or a map of the things around you, by looking at the light coming from different spots in the scene about you.
Sound is different.
Audible sound has a wavelength that can be up to 50 feet long.
And that makes it really difficult -- in fact, in practical purposes, impossible -- to make an image of something you really care about.
Your child's face.
Instead, we use sound to listen for features like pitch and tone and rhythm and volume to infer a story behind the sounds.
That's Alice talking.
That's Bob interrupting.
Silly Bob.
So, the same is true of gravitational waves.
We can't use them to make simple images of things out in the Universe.
But by listening to changes in the amplitude and frequency of those waves, we can hear the story that those waves are telling.
And at least for LIGO, the frequencies that it can hear are in the audio band.
So if we convert the wave patterns into pressure waves and air, into sound, we can literally hear the Universe speaking to us.
For example, listening to gravity, just in this way, can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, something my colleague Scott has spent an awful lot of time thinking about.
(Audio) SH: If the two black holes are non-spinning, you get a very simple chirp: whoop!
If the two bodies are spinning very rapidly, I have that same chirp, but with a modulation on top of it, so it kind of goes: whir, whir, whir!
It's sort of the vocabulary of spin imprinted on this waveform.
AA: So on September 14, 2015, a date that's definitely going to live in my memory, LIGO heard this: [Whirring sound] So if you know how to listen, that is the sound of -- (Audio) SH: ... two black holes, each of about 30 solar masses, that were whirling around at a rate comparable to what goes on in your blender.
AA: It's worth pausing here to think about what that means.
Two black holes, the densest thing in the Universe, one with a mass of 29 Suns and one with a mass of 36 Suns, whirling around each other 100 times per second before they collide.
Just imagine the power of that.
It's fantastic.
And we know it because we heard it.
That's the lasting importance of LIGO.
It's an entirely new way to observe the Universe that we've never had before.
It's a way that lets us hear the Universe and hear the invisible.
And there's a lot out there that we can't see -- in practice or even in principle.
So supernova, for example: I would love to know why very massive stars explode in supernovae.
They're very useful; we've learned a lot about the Universe from them.
The problem is, all the interesting physics happens in the core, and the core is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron and carbon and silicon.
We'll never see through it, it's opaque to light.
Gravitational waves go through iron as if it were glass -- totally transparent.
The Big Bang: I would love to be able to explore the first few moments of the Universe, but we'll never see them, because the Big Bang itself is obscured by its own afterglow.
With gravitational waves, we should be able to see all the way back to the beginning.
Perhaps most importantly, I'm positive that there are things out there that we've never seen that we may never be able to see and that we haven't even imagined -- things that we'll only discover by listening.
And in fact, even in that very first event, LIGO found things that we didn't expect.
Here's my colleague and one of the key members of the LIGO collaboration, Matt Evans, my colleague at MIT, addressing exactly that: (Audio) Matt Evans: The kinds of stars which produce the black holes that we observed here are the dinosaurs of the Universe.
They're these massive things that are old, from prehistoric times, and the black holes are kind of like the dinosaur bones with which we do this archeology.
So it lets us really get a whole nother angle on what's out there in the Universe and how the stars came to be, and in the end, of course, how we came to be out of this whole mess.
AA: Our challenge now is to be as audacious as possible.
Thanks to LIGO, we know how to build exquisite detectors that can listen to the Universe, to the rustle and the chirp of the cosmos.
Our job is to dream up and build new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories -- on the ground, in space.
I mean, what could be more glorious than listening to the Big Bang itself?
Our job now is to dream big.
Dream with us.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Could human civilization eventually spread across the whole Milky Way galaxy?
Could we move beyond our small blue planet to establish colonies in the multitude of star systems out there?
This question's a pretty daunting one.
There are around 300 billion stars in the galaxy, which is about 160,000 light-years across.
So far we've sent a single spacecraft outside our solar system, trudging along at 0.006% of the speed of light.
At that rate, it would take over 2.5 billion years just to get from one end of the galaxy to the other.
And then there's the question of human survival.
The gulf between stars is simply enormous.
We couldn't live sustainably on most planets, and we require a lot of resources to stay alive.
And yet, decades ago, scholars found that it's theoretically possible to not just spread human civilization across the galaxy, but to do so quite quickly, without breaking any known laws of physics.
Their idea is based on the work of a mathematician named John von Neumann, who designed on paper machines that could self-replicate and create new generations of themselves.
These would later come to be known as von Neumann machines.
In the context of space exploration, von Neumann machines could be built on Earth and launched into space.
There, the self-sufficient machines would land on distant planets.
They would then mine the available resources and harvest energy, build replicas of themselves, launch those to the nearest planets, and continue the cycle.
The result is the creation of millions of probes spreading outwards into the universe like a drop of ink in a fishbowl.
Scholars crunched the numbers and found that a single von Neumann machine traveling at 5% of the speed of light should be able to replicate throughout our galaxy in 4 million years or less.
That may sound like a long time, but when you consider that our universe is 14 billion years old, on a cosmic scale, it's incredibly fast - the equivalent of about 2.5 hours in an entire year.
Creating von Neumann machines would require a few technologies we don't have yet, including advanced artificial intelligence, miniaturization, and better propulsion systems.
If we wanted to use them to spread actual humans throughout the galaxy, we would need yet another technological leap - the ability to artificially grow biological organisms and bodies using raw elements and genetic information.
Regardless, if in the last billion years an alien civilization created such a machine and set it multiplying its way toward us, our galaxy would be swarming with them by now.
So then where are all these machines?
Some astronomers, like Carl Sagan, say that intelligent aliens wouldn't build self-replicating machines at all.
They might hurtle out of control, scavenging planets to their cores in order to keep replicating.
Others take the machines absence as proof that intelligent alien civilizations don't exist, or that they go extinct before they can develop the necessary technologies.
But all this hasn't stopped people from imagining what it would be like if they were out there.
Science fiction author David Brin writes about a universe in which many different von Neumann machines exist and proliferate simultaneously.
Some are designed to greet young civilizations, others to locate and destroy them before they become a threat.
In fact, in Brin's story "Lungfish," some von Neumann machines are keeping a close watch over the Earth right now, waiting for us to reach a certain level of sophistication before they make their move.
For now, all we have is curiosity and theory.
But the next time you look at the night sky, consider that billions of self-replicating machines could be advancing between stars in our galaxy right now.
If they exist, one of them will eventually land on Earth, or maybe, just maybe, they're already here.
Your favorite band is great at playing music, but not so great at being organized.
They keep misplacing their instruments on tour, and it's driving their manager mad.
On the day of the big concert, the band wakes up to find themselves tied up in a windowless, soundproof practice room.
Their manager explains what's happening.
Outside, there are ten large boxes.
Each contains one of your instruments, but don't be fooled by the pictures - they've been randomly placed.
I'm going to let you out one at a time.
While you're outside, you can look inside any five boxes before security takes you back to the tour bus.
You can't touch the instruments or in any way communicate what you find to the others.
No marking the boxes, shouting, nothing.
If each one of you can find your own instrument, then you can play tonight.
Otherwise, the label is dropping you.
You have three minutes to think about it before we start.
The band is in despair.
After all, each musician only has a 50% chance of finding their instrument by picking five random boxes.
And the chances that all ten will succeed are even lower - just 1 in 1024.
But suddenly, the drummer comes up with a valid strategy that has a better than 35% chance of working.
Can you figure out what it was?
Pause the video on the next screen if you want to figure it out for yourself!
Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 Here's what the drummer said: Everyone first open the box with the picture of your instrument.
If your instrument is inside, you're done.
Otherwise, look at whatever's in there, and then open the box with that picture on it.
Keep going that way until you find your instrument.
The bandmates are skeptical, but amazingly enough, they all find what they need.
And a few hours later, they're playing to thousands of adoring fans.
So why did the drummer's strategy work?
Each musician follows a linked sequence that starts with the box whose outside matches their instrument and ends with the box actually containing it.
Note that if they kept going, that would lead them back to the start, so this is a loop.
For example, if the boxes are arranged like so, the singer would open the first box to find the drums, go to the eighth box to find the bass, and find her microphone in the third box, which would point back to the first.
This works much better than random guessing because by starting with the box with the picture of their instrument, each musician restricts their search to the loop that contains their instrument, and there are decent odds, about 35%, that all of the loops will be of length five or less.
How do we calculate those odds?
For the sake of simplicity, we'll demonstrate with a simplified case, four instruments and no more than two guesses allowed for each musician.
Let's start by finding the odds of failure, the chance that someone will need to open three or four boxes before they find their instrument.
There are six distinct four-box loops.
One fun way to count them is to make a square, put an instrument at each corner, and draw the diagonals.
See how many unique loops you can find, and keep in mind that these two are considered the same, they just start at different points.
These two, however, are different.
We can visualize the eight distinct three-box loops using triangles.
You'll find four possible triangles depending on which instrument you leave out, and two distinct paths on each.
So of the 24 possible combinations of boxes, there are 14 that lead to faliure, and ten that result in success.
That computational strategy works for any even number of musicians, but if you want a shortcut, it generalizes to a handy equation.
Plug in ten musicians, and we get odds of about 35%.
What if there were 1,000 musicians?
1,000,000?
As n increases, the odds approach about 30%.
Not a guarantee, but with a bit of musician's luck, it's far from hopeless.
Hi everybody, if you liked this riddle, try solving these two.
It begins with a bit of discomfort and soon becomes a pressing sensation that's impossible to ignore.
Finally, it's all you can think about, and out of sheer desperation, you go on a hunt for a bathroom until "ahh."
Humans should urinate at least four to six times a day, but occasionally, the pressures of modern life forces us to clench and hold it in.
How bad is this habit, and how long can our bodies withstand it?
The answers lie in the workings of the bladder, an oval pouch that sits inside the pelvis.
Surrounding this structure are several other organs that together make up the whole urinary system.
Two kidneys, two ureters, two urethral sphincters, and a urethra.
Constantly trickling down from the kidneys is the yellowish liquid known as urine.
The kidneys make urine from a mix of water and the body's waste products, funneling the unwanted fluid into two muscular tubes called ureters.
These carry it downward into the hollow organ known as the bladder.
This organ's muscular wall is made of tissue called detrusor muscle which relaxes as the bladder fills allowing it to inflate like a balloon.
As the bladder gets full, the detrusor contracts.
The internal urethral sphincter automatically and involuntarily opens, and the urine is released.
Whooshing downwards, the fluid enters the urethra and stops short at the external urethral sphincter.
This works like a tap.
When you want to delay urinating, you keep the sphincter closed.
When you want to release it, you can voluntarily open the flood gates.
But how do you sense your bladder's fullness so you know when to pee?
Inside the layers of detrusor muscles are millions of stretch receptors that get triggered as the bladder fills.
They send signals along your nerves to the sacral region in your spinal cord.
A reflex signal travels back to your bladder, making the detrusor muscle contract slightly and increasing the bladder's pressure so you're aware that it's filling up.
Simultaneously, the internal urethral sphincter opens.
This is called the micturition reflex.
The brain can counter it if it's not a good time to urinate by sending another signal to contract the external urethral sphincter.
With about 150 to 200 milliliters of urine inside of it, the bladder's muscular wall is stretched enough for you to sense that there's urine within.
At about 400 to 500 milliliters, the pressure becomes uncomfortable.
The bladder can go on stretching, but only to a point.
Above 1,000 milliliters, it may burst.
Most people would lose bladder control before this happens, but in very rare cases, such as when as a person can't sense the need to urinate, the pouch can rupture painfully requiring surgery to fix.
But under normal circumstances, your decision to urinate stops the brain's signal to the external urethral sphincter, causing it to relax and the bladder to empty.
The external urethral sphincter is one of the muscles of the pelvic floor, and it provides support to the urethra and bladder neck.
It's lucky we have these pelvic floor muscles because placing pressure on the system by coughing, sneezing, laughing, or jumping could cause bladder leakage.
Instead, the pelvic floor muscles keep the region sealed until you're ready to go.
But holding it in for too long, forcing out your urine too fast, or urinating without proper physical support may over time weaken or overwork that muscular sling.
That can lead to an overactive pelvic floor, bladder pain, urgency, or urinary incontinence.
So in the interest of long-term health, it's not a great habit to hold your pee.
But in the short term, at least, your body and brain have got you covered, so you can conveniently choose your moment of sweet release.
When a team of archaeologists recently came across some 15,000 year-old human remains, they made an interesting discovery.
The teeth of those ancient humans were riddled with holes.
Their cavities were caused by the same thing that still plagues us today, specific tiny microbes that live in our mouths.
These microbes are with us soon after birth.
We typically pick them up as babies from our mothers' mouths.
And as our teeth erupt, they naturally begin to accumulate communities of bacteria.
Depending on what we eat, and specifically how much sugar we consume, certain microbes can overpopulate and cause cavities.
Diets high in sugary foods cause an explosion of bacteria called mutans streptococci in our mouths.
Like humans, these microorganisms love sugar, using it as a molecular building block and energy source.
As they consume it, the bacteria generate byproducts in the form of acids, such as lactic acid.
Mutans streptococci are resistant to this acid, but unfortunately, our teeth aren't.
While each human tooth is coated in a hardy, protective layer of enamel, it's no match for acid.
That degrades the armor over time, leaching away its calcium minerals.
Gradually, acid wears down a pathway for bacteria into the tooth's secondary layer called the dentin.
Since blood vessels and nerves in our teeth are enclosed deep within, at this stage, the expanding cavity doesn't hurt.
But if the damage extends beyond the dentin, the bacterial invasion progresses causing excruciating pain as the nerves become exposed.
Without treatment, the whole tooth may become infected and require removal all due to those sugar-loving bacteria.
The more sugar our food contains, the more our teeth are put at risk.
Those cavemen would hardly have indulged in sugary treats, however, so what caused their cavities?
In meat-heavy diets, there would have been a low-risk of cavities developing because lean meat contains very little sugar, but that's not all our early human ancestors ate.
Cavemen would also have consumed root vegetables, nuts, and grains, all of which contain carbohydrates.
When exposed to enzymes in the saliva, carbohydrates get broken down into simpler sugars, which can become the fodder for those ravenous mouth bacteria.
So while ancient humans did eat less sugar compared to us, their teeth were still exposed to sugars.
That doesn't mean they were unable to treat their cavities, though.
Archaeological remains show that about 14,000 years ago, humans were already using sharpened flint to remove bits of rotten teeth.
Ancient humans even made rudimentary drills to smooth out the rough holes left behind and beeswax to plug cavities, like modern-day fillings.
Today, we have much more sophisticated techniques and tools, which is fortunate because we also need to contend with our more damaging, sugar-guzzling ways.
After the Industrial Revolution, the human incidence of cavities surged because suddenly we had technological advances that made refined sugar cheaper and accessible.
Today, an incredible 92% of American adults have had cavities in their teeth.
Some people are more susceptible to cavities due to genes that may cause certain weaknesses, like softer enamel, but for most, high sugar consumption is to blame.
However, we have developed other ways of minimizing cavities besides reducing our intake of sugar and starch.
In most toothpastes and many water supplies, we use tiny amounts of fluoride.
That strengthens teeth and encourages the growth of enamel crystals that build up a tooth's defenses against acid.
When cavities do develop, we use tooth fillings to fill and close off the infected area, preventing them from getting worse.
The best way to avoid a cavity is still cutting down on sugar intake and practicing good oral hygiene to get rid of the bacteria and their food sources.
That includes regular tooth brushing, flossing, and avoiding sugary, starchy, and sticky foods that cling to your teeth between meals.
Gradually, the population of sugar-loving microbes in your mouth will decline.
Unlike the cavemen of yesteryear, today we have the knowledge required to avert a cavity calamity.
We just need to use it.
What started as a platform for hobbyists is poised to become a multibillion-dollar industry.
Inspection, environmental monitoring, photography and film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones, and their enablers are the capabilities being developed at research facilities around the world.
For example, before aerial package delivery entered our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines built a six-meter-tall tower composed of 1,500 bricks in front of a live audience at the FRAC Centre in France, and several years ago, they started to fly with ropes.
By tethering flying machines, they can achieve high speeds and accelerations in very tight spaces.
They can also autonomously build tensile structures.
Skills learned include how to carry loads, how to cope with disturbances, and in general, how to interact with the physical world.
Today we want to show you some new projects that we've been working on.
Their aim is to push the boundary of what can be achieved with autonomous flight.
Now, for a system to function autonomously, it must collectively know the location of its mobile objects in space.
Back at our lab at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to locate objects, which then allows us to focus our efforts on the rapid development of highly dynamic tasks.
For the demos you will see today, however, we will use new localization technology developed by Verity Studios, a spin-off from our lab.
There are no external cameras.
Each flying machine uses onboard sensors to determine its location in space and onboard computation to determine what its actions should be.
The only external commands are high-level ones such as "take off" and "land."
This is a so-called tail-sitter.
It's an aircraft that tries to have its cake and eat it.
Like other fixed-wing aircraft, it is efficient in forward flight, much more so than helicopters and variations thereof.
Unlike most other fixed-wing aircraft, however, it is capable of hovering, which has huge advantages for takeoff, landing and general versatility.
There is no free lunch, unfortunately.
One of the limitations with tail-sitters is that they're susceptible to disturbances such as wind gusts.
We're developing new control architectures and algorithms that address this limitation.
The idea is for the aircraft to recover no matter what state it finds itself in, and through practice, improve its performance over time.
(Applause) OK.
When doing research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that try to get at the heart of a matter.
For example, one such question would be, what is the minimum number of moving parts needed for controlled flight?
Now, there are practical reasons why you may want to know the answer to such a question.
Helicopters, for example, are affectionately known as machines with a thousand moving parts all conspiring to do you bodily harm.
It turns out that decades ago, skilled pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a tail rudder.
We recently discovered that it could be done with just one.
This is the monospinner, the world's mechanically simplest controllable flying machine, invented just a few months ago.
It has only one moving part, a propeller.
It has no flaps, no hinges, no ailerons, no other actuators, no other control surfaces, just a simple propeller.
Even though it's mechanically simple, there's a lot going on in its little electronic brain to allow it to fly in a stable fashion and to move anywhere it wants in space.
Even so, it doesn't yet have the sophisticated algorithms of the tail-sitter, which means that in order to get it to fly, I have to throw it just right.
And because the probability of me throwing it just right is very low, given everybody watching me, what we're going to do instead is show you a video that we shot last night.
(Laughter) (Applause) If the monospinner is an exercise in frugality, this machine here, the omnicopter, with its eight propellers, is an exercise in excess.
What can you do with all this surplus?
The thing to notice is that it is highly symmetric.
As a result, it is ambivalent to orientation.
This gives it an extraordinary capability.
It can move anywhere it wants in space irrespective of where it is facing and even of how it is rotating.
It has its own complexities, mainly having to do with the interacting flows from its eight propellers.
Some of this can be modeled, while the rest can be learned on the fly.
Let's take a look.
(Applause) If flying machines are going to enter part of our daily lives, they will need to become extremely safe and reliable.
This machine over here is actually two separate two-propeller flying machines.
This one wants to spin clockwise.
This other one wants to spin counterclockwise.
When you put them together, they behave like one high-performance quadrocopter.
If anything goes wrong, however -- a motor fails, a propeller fails, electronics, even a battery pack -- the machine can still fly, albeit in a degraded fashion.
We're going to demonstrate this to you now by disabling one of its halves.
(Applause) This last demonstration is an exploration of synthetic swarms.
The large number of autonomous, coordinated entities offers a new palette for aesthetic expression.
We've taken commercially available micro quadcopters, each weighing less than a slice of bread, by the way, and outfitted them with our localization technology and custom algorithms.
Because each unit knows where it is in space and is self-controlled, there is really no limit to their number.
(Applause) (Applause) (Applause) Hopefully, these demonstrations will motivate you to dream up new revolutionary roles for flying machines.
That ultrasafe one over there for example has aspirations to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.
(Laughter) The reality is that it is difficult to predict the impact of nascent technology.
And for folks like us, the real reward is the journey and the act of creation.
It's a continual reminder of how wonderful and magical the universe we live in is, that it allows creative, clever creatures to sculpt it in such spectacular ways.
The fact that this technology has such huge commercial and economic potential is just icing on the cake.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Few individuals have influenced the world and many of today's thinkers like Plato.
One 20th century philosopher even went so far as to describe all of Western philosophy as a series of footnotes to Plato.
He created the first Western university and was teacher to Ancient Greece's greatest minds, including Aristotle.
But even one of the founders of philosophy wasn't perfect.
Along with his great ideas, Plato had a few that haven't exactly stood the test of time.
So here are brief rundowns of a few of his best and worst ideas.
Plato argued that beyond our imperfect world was a perfect unchanging world of Forms.
Forms are the ideal versions of the things and concepts we see around us.
They serve as a sort of instruction manual to our own world.
Floating around the world of Forms is the ideal tree, and the ideal YouTube channel, and even the ideal justice, or ideal love.
Our own reality is comprised of imperfect copies of ideal Forms.
Plato argued that philosophers should strive to contemplate and understand these perfect Forms so that they may better navigate our misleading reality.
While it may seem silly, the disconnect between the world as it appears and the greater truth behind it is one of philosophy's most vexing problems.
It's been the subject of thousands of pages by theologians, philosophers, and screenwriters alike.
It raises questions like should we trust our senses to come to the truth or our own reason?
For Plato, the answer is reason.
It alone provides us with at least the potential to contemplate the Forms.
But reason didn't always pan out for Plato himself.
When he sought to situate humankind amongst the animals, he lumped us in with birds.
"Featherless bipeds" was his official designation.
Diogenes the Cynic, annoyed by this definition, stormed into Plato's class with a plucked chicken, announcing, "Behold. Plato's man."
But back to a few good ideas.
Plato is one of the earliest political theorists on record, and with Aristotle, is seen as one of the founders of political science.
He reasoned that being a ruler was no different than any other craft, whether a potter or doctor, and that only those who had mastered the craft were fit to lead.
Ruling was the craft of contemplating the Forms.
In his Republic, Plato imagined a utopia where justice is the ultimate goal.
Plato's ideal city seeks a harmonious balance between its individual parts and should be lead by a philosopher king.
Millennia before his time, Plato also reasoned that women were equally able to rule in this model city.
Unfortunately, Plato was inconsistent with women, elsewhere likening them to children.
He also believed that a woman's womb was a live animal that could wander around in her body and cause illness.
This bad idea, also espoused by other contemporaries of Plato, was sadly influential for hundreds of years in European medicine.
Furthermore, he thought that society should be divided into three groups: producers, the military, and the rulers, and that a great noble lie should convince everyone to follow this structure.
The noble lie he proposed was that we're all born with gold, silver, or a mixture of brass and iron in our souls, which determine our roles in life.
Some thinkers have gone on to credit the idea of the noble lie as a prototype for 20th century propaganda, and the philosopher king as inspiration for the dictators that used them.
Should a few bad ideas tarnish Plato's status as one of the greatest philosophers in history?
No!
Plato gave the leaders and thinkers who came after him a place to start.
Through the centuries, we've had the chance to test those ideas through writing and experience, and have accepted some while rejecting others.
We are continuing to refine, amend, and edit his ideas which have become foundations of the modern world.
As a wildfire rages through the grasslands, three lions and three wildebeest flee for their lives.
To escape the inferno, they must cross over to the left bank of a crocodile-infested river.
Fortunately, there happens to be a raft nearby.
It can carry up to two animals at a time, and needs as least one lion or wildebeest on board to row it across the river.
There's just one problem.
If the lions ever outnumber the wildebeest on either side of the river, even for a moment, their instincts will kick in, and the results won't be pretty.
That includes the animals in the boat when it's on a given side of the river.
What's the fastest way for all six animals to get across without the lions stopping for dinner?
Pause here if you want to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If you feel stuck on a problem like this, try listing all the decisions you can make at each point, and the consequences each choice leads to.
For instance, there are five options for who goes across first: one wildebeest, one lion, two wildebeest, two lions, or one of each.
If one animal goes alone, it'll just have to come straight back.
And if two wildebeest cross first, the remaining one will immediately get eaten.
So those options are all out.
Sending two lions, or one of each animal, can actually both lead to solutions in the same number of moves.
For the sake of time, we'll focus on the second one.
One of each animal crosses.
Now, if the wildebeest stays and the lion returns, there will be three lions on the right bank.
Bad news for the two remaining wildebeest.
So we need to have the lion stay on the left bank and the wildebeest go back to the right.
Now we have the same five options, but with one lion already on the left bank.
If two wildebeest go, the one that stays will get eaten, and if one of each animal goes, the wildebeest on the raft will be outnumbered as soon as it reaches the other side.
So that's a dead end, which means that at the third crossing, only the two lions can go.
One gets dropped off, leaving two lions on the left bank.
The third lion takes the raft back to the right bank where the wildebeest are waiting.
What now?
Well, since we've got two lions waiting on the left bank, the only option is for two wildebeest to cross.
Next, there's no sense in two wildebeest going back, since that just reverses the last step.
And if two lions go back, they'll outnumber the wildebeest on the right bank.
So one lion and one wildebeest take the raft back leaving us with one of each animal on the left bank and two of each on the right.
Again, there's no point in sending the lion-wildebeest pair back, so the next trip should be either a pair of lions or a pair of wildebeest.
If the lions go, they'd eat the wildebeest on the left, so they stay, and the two wildebeest cross instead.
Now we're quite close because the wildebeest are all where they need to be with safety in numbers.
All that's left is for that one lion to raft back and bring his fellow lions over one by one.
That makes eleven trips total, the smallest number needed to get everyone across safely.
The solution that involves sending both lions on the first step works similarly, and also takes eleven crossings.
The six animals escape unharmed from the fire just in time and begin their new lives across the river.
Of course, now that the danger's passed, it remains to be seen how long their unlikely alliance will last.
I was excited to be a part of the "Dream" theme, and then I found out I'm leading off the "Nightmare?" section of it.
(Laughter) And certainly there are things about the climate crisis that qualify.
And I have some bad news, but I have a lot more good news.
I'm going to propose three questions and the answer to the first one necessarily involves a little bad news.
But -- hang on, because the answers to the second and third questions really are very positive.
So the first question is, "Do we really have to change?"
And of course, the Apollo Mission, among other things changed the environmental movement, really launched the modern environmental movement.
18 months after this Earthrise picture was first seen on earth, the first Earth Day was organized.
And we learned a lot about ourselves looking back at our planet from space.
And one of the things that we learned confirmed what the scientists have long told us.
One of the most essential facts about the climate crisis has to do with the sky.
As this picture illustrates, the sky is not the vast and limitless expanse that appears when we look up from the ground.
It is a very thin shell of atmosphere surrounding the planet.
That right now is the open sewer for our industrial civilization as it's currently organized.
We are spewing 110 million tons of heat-trapping global warming pollution into it every 24 hours, free of charge, go ahead.
And there are many sources of the greenhouse gases, I'm certainly not going to go through them all.
I'm going to focus on the main one, but agriculture is involved, diet is involved, population is involved.
Management of forests, transportation, the oceans, the melting of the permafrost.
But I'm going to focus on the heart of the problem, which is the fact that we still rely on dirty, carbon-based fuels for 85 percent of all the energy that our world burns every year.
And you can see from this image that after World War II, the emission rates started really accelerating.
And the accumulated amount of man-made, global warming pollution that is up in the atmosphere now traps as much extra heat energy as would be released by 400,000 Hiroshima-class atomic bombs exploding every 24 hours, 365 days a year.
Fact-checked over and over again, conservative, it's the truth.
Now it's a big planet, but -- (Explosion sound) that is a lot of energy, particularly when you multiply it 400,000 times per day.
And all that extra heat energy is heating up the atmosphere, the whole earth system.
Let's look at the atmosphere.
This is a depiction of what we used to think of as the normal distribution of temperatures.
The white represents normal temperature days; 1951-1980 are arbitrarily chosen.
The blue are cooler than average days, the red are warmer than average days.
But the entire curve has moved to the right in the 1980s.
And you'll see in the lower right-hand corner the appearance of statistically significant numbers of extremely hot days.
In the 90s, the curve shifted further.
And in the last 10 years, you see the extremely hot days are now more numerous than the cooler than average days.
In fact, they are 150 times more common on the surface of the earth than they were just 30 years ago.
So we're having record-breaking temperatures.
Fourteen of the 15 of the hottest years ever measured with instruments have been in this young century.
The hottest of all was last year.
Last month was the 371st month in a row warmer than the 20th-century average.
And for the first time, not only the warmest January, but for the first time, it was more than two degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the average.
These higher temperatures are having an effect on animals, plants, people, ecosystems.
But on a global basis, 93 percent of all the extra heat energy is trapped in the oceans.
And the scientists can measure the heat buildup much more precisely now at all depths: deep, mid-ocean, the first few hundred meters.
And this, too, is accelerating.
It goes back more than a century.
And more than half of the increase has been in the last 19 years.
This has consequences.
The first order of consequence: the ocean-based storms get stronger.
Super Typhoon Haiyan went over areas of the Pacific five and a half degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal before it slammed into Tacloban, as the most destructive storm ever to make landfall.
Pope Francis, who has made such a difference to this whole issue, visited Tacloban right after that.
Superstorm Sandy went over areas of the Atlantic nine degrees warmer than normal before slamming into New York and New Jersey.
The second order of consequences are affecting all of us right now.
The warmer oceans are evaporating much more water vapor into the skies.
Average humidity worldwide has gone up four percent.
And it creates these atmospheric rivers.
The Brazilian scientists call them "flying rivers."
And they funnel all of that extra water vapor over the land where storm conditions trigger these massive record-breaking downpours.
This is from Montana.
Take a look at this storm last August.
As it moves over Tucson, Arizona.
It literally splashes off the city.
These downpours are really unusual.
Last July in Houston, Texas, it rained for two days, 162 billion gallons.
That represents more than two days of the full flow of Niagara Falls in the middle of the city, which was, of course, paralyzed.
These record downpours are creating historic floods and mudslides.
This one is from Chile last year.
And you'll see that warehouse going by.
There are oil tankers cars going by.
This is from Spain last September, you could call this the running of the cars and trucks, I guess.
Every night on the TV news now is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation.
(Laughter) I mean, really.
The insurance industry has certainly noticed, the losses have been mounting up.
They're not under any illusions about what's happening.
And the causality requires a moment of discussion.
We're used to thinking of linear cause and linear effect -- one cause, one effect.
This is systemic causation.
As the great Kevin Trenberth says, "All storms are different now.
There's so much extra energy in the atmosphere, there's so much extra water vapor.
Every storm is different now."
So, the same extra heat pulls the soil moisture out of the ground and causes these deeper, longer, more pervasive droughts and many of them are underway right now.
It dries out the vegetation and causes more fires in the western part of North America.
There's certainly been evidence of that, a lot of them.
More lightning, as the heat energy builds up, there's a considerable amount of additional lightning also.
These climate-related disasters also have geopolitical consequences and create instability.
The climate-related historic drought that started in Syria in 2006 destroyed 60 percent of the farms in Syria, killed 80 percent of the livestock, and drove 1.5 million climate refugees into the cities of Syria, where they collided with another 1.5 million refugees from the Iraq War.
And along with other factors, that opened the gates of Hell that people are trying to close now.
The US Defense Department has long warned of consequences from the climate crisis, including refugees, food and water shortages and pandemic disease.
Right now we're seeing microbial diseases from the tropics spread to the higher latitudes; the transportation revolution has had a lot to do with this.
But the changing conditions change the latitudes and the areas where these microbial diseases can become endemic and change the range of the vectors, like mosquitoes and ticks that carry them.
The Zika epidemic now -- we're better positioned in North America because it's still a little too cool and we have a better public health system.
But when women in some regions of South and Central America are advised not to get pregnant for two years -- that's something new, that ought to get our attention.
The Lancet, one of the two greatest medical journals in the world, last summer labeled this a medical emergency now.
And there are many factors because of it.
This is also connected to the extinction crisis.
We're in danger of losing 50 percent of all the living species on earth by the end of this century.
And already, land-based plants and animals are now moving towards the poles at an average rate of 15 feet per day.
Speaking of the North Pole, last December 29, the same storm that caused historic flooding in the American Midwest, raised temperatures at the North Pole 50 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal, causing the thawing of the North Pole in the middle of the long, dark, winter, polar night.
And when the land-based ice of the Arctic melts, it raises sea level.
Paul Nicklen's beautiful photograph from Svalbard illustrates this.
It's more dangerous coming off Greenland and particularly, Antarctica.
The 10 largest risk cities for sea-level rise by population are mostly in South and Southeast Asia.
When you measure it by assets at risk, number one is Miami: three and a half trillion dollars at risk.
Number three: New York and Newark.
I was in Miami last fall during the supermoon, one of the highest high-tide days.
And there were fish from the ocean swimming in some of the streets of Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale and Del Rey.
And this happens regularly during the highest-tide tides now.
Not with rain -- they call it "sunny-day flooding."
It comes up through the storm sewers.
And the Mayor of Miami speaks for many when he says it is long past time this can be viewed through a partisan lens.
This is a crisis that's getting worse day by day.
We have to move beyond partisanship.
And I want to take a moment to honor these House Republicans -- (Applause) who had the courage last fall to step out and take a political risk, by telling the truth about the climate crisis.
So the cost of the climate crisis is mounting up, there are many of these aspects I haven't even mentioned.
It's an enormous burden.
I'll mention just one more, because the World Economic Forum last month in Davos, after their annual survey of 750 economists, said the climate crisis is now the number one risk to the global economy.
So you get central bankers like Mark Carney, the head of the UK Central Bank, saying the vast majority of the carbon reserves are unburnable.
Subprime carbon.
I'm not going to remind you what happened with subprime mortgages, but it's the same thing.
If you look at all of the carbon fuels that were burned since the beginning of the industrial revolution, this is the quantity burned in the last 16 years.
Here are all the ones that are proven and left on the books, 28 trillion dollars.
The International Energy Agency says only this amount can be burned.
So the rest, 22 trillion dollars -- unburnable.
Risk to the global economy.
That's why divestment movement makes practical sense and is not just a moral imperative.
So the answer to the first question, "Must we change?"
is yes, we have to change.
Second question, "Can we change?"
This is the exciting news!
The best projections in the world 16 years ago were that by 2010, the world would be able to install 30 gigawatts of wind capacity.
We beat that mark by 14 and a half times over.
We see an exponential curve for wind installations now.
We see the cost coming down dramatically.
Some countries -- take Germany, an industrial powerhouse with a climate not that different from Vancouver's, by the way -- one day last December, got 81 percent of all its energy from renewable resources, mainly solar and wind.
A lot of countries are getting more than half on an average basis.
More good news: energy storage, from batteries particularly, is now beginning to take off because the cost has been coming down very dramatically to solve the intermittency problem.
With solar, the news is even more exciting!
The best projections 14 years ago were that we would install one gigawatt per year by 2010.
When 2010 came around, we beat that mark by 17 times over.
Last year, we beat it by 58 times over.
This year, we're on track to beat it 68 times over.
We're going to win this.
We are going to prevail.
The exponential curve on solar is even steeper and more dramatic.
When I came to this stage 10 years ago, this is where it was.
We have seen a revolutionary breakthrough in the emergence of these exponential curves.
(Applause) And the cost has come down 10 percent per year for 30 years.
And it's continuing to come down.
Now, the business community has certainly noticed this, because it's crossing the grid parity point.
Cheaper solar penetration rates are beginning to rise.
Grid parity is understood as that line, that threshold, below which renewable electricity is cheaper than electricity from burning fossil fuels.
That threshold is a little bit like the difference between 32 degrees Fahrenheit and 33 degrees Fahrenheit, or zero and one Celsius.
It's a difference of more than one degree, it's the difference between ice and water.
And it's the difference between markets that are frozen up, and liquid flows of capital into new opportunities for investment.
This is the biggest new business opportunity in the history of the world, and two-thirds of it is in the private sector.
We are seeing an explosion of new investment.
Starting in 2010, investments globally in renewable electricity generation surpassed fossils.
The gap has been growing ever since.
The projections for the future are even more dramatic, even though fossil energy is now still subsidized at a rate 40 times larger than renewables.
And by the way, if you add the projections for nuclear on here, particularly if you assume that the work many are doing to try to break through to safer and more acceptable, more affordable forms of nuclear, this could change even more dramatically.
So is there any precedent for such a rapid adoption of a new technology?
Well, there are many, but let's look at cell phones.
In 1980, AT&amp;T, then Ma Bell, commissioned McKinsey to do a global market survey of those clunky new mobile phones that appeared then.
"How many can we sell by the year 2000?" they asked.
McKinsey came back and said, "900,000."
And sure enough, when the year 2000 arrived, they did sell 900,000 -- in the first three days.
And for the balance of the year, they sold 120 times more.
And now there are more cell connections than there are people in the world.
So, why were they not only wrong, but way wrong?
I've asked that question myself, "Why?"
(Laughter) And I think the answer is in three parts.
First, the cost came down much faster than anybody expected, even as the quality went up.
And low-income countries, places that did not have a landline grid -- they leap-frogged to the new technology.
The big expansion has been in the developing counties.
So what about the electricity grids in the developing world?
Well, not so hot.
And in many areas, they don't exist.
There are more people without any electricity at all in India than the entire population of the United States of America.
So now we're getting this: solar panels on grass huts and new business models that make it affordable.
Muhammad Yunus financed this one in Bangladesh with micro-credit.
This is a village market.
Bangladesh is now the fastest-deploying country in the world: two systems per minute on average, night and day.
And we have all we need: enough energy from the Sun comes to the earth every hour to supply the full world's energy needs for an entire year.
It's actually a little bit less than an hour.
So the answer to the second question, "Can we change?"
is clearly "Yes."
And it's an ever-firmer "yes."
Last question, "Will we change?"
Paris really was a breakthrough, some of the provisions are binding and the regular reviews will matter a lot.
But nations aren't waiting, they're going ahead.
China has already announced that starting next year, they're adopting a nationwide cap and trade system.
They will likely link up with the European Union.
The United States has already been changing.
All of these coal plants were proposed in the next 10 years and canceled.
All of these existing coal plants were retired.
All of these coal plants have had their retirement announced.
All of them -- canceled.
We are moving forward.
Last year -- if you look at all of the investment in new electricity generation in the United States, almost three-quarters was from renewable energy, mostly wind and solar.
We are solving this crisis.
The only question is: how long will it take to get there?
So, it matters that a lot of people are organizing to insist on this change.
Almost 400,000 people marched in New York City before the UN special session on this.
Many thousands, tens of thousands, marched in cities around the world.
And so, I am extremely optimistic.
As I said before, we are going to win this.
I'll finish with this story.
When I was 13 years old, I heard that proposal by President Kennedy to land a person on the Moon and bring him back safely in 10 years.
And I heard adults of that day and time say, "That's reckless, expensive, may well fail."
But eight years and two months later, in the moment that Neil Armstrong set foot on the Moon, there was great cheer that went up in NASA's mission control in Houston.
Here's a little-known fact about that: the average age of the systems engineers, the controllers in the room that day, was 26, which means, among other things, their age, when they heard that challenge, was 18.
We now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have faced.
One of the greatest poets of the last century in the US, Wallace Stevens, wrote a line that has stayed with me: "After the final 'no,' there comes a 'yes,' and on that 'yes', the future world depends."
When the abolitionists started their movement, they met with no after no after no.
And then came a yes.
The Women's Suffrage and Women's Rights Movement met endless no's, until finally, there was a yes.
The Civil Rights Movement, the movement against apartheid, and more recently, the movement for gay and lesbian rights here in the United States and elsewhere.
After the final "no" comes a "yes."
When any great moral challenge is ultimately resolved into a binary choice between what is right and what is wrong, the outcome is fore-ordained because of who we are as human beings.
Ninety-nine percent of us, that is where we are now and it is why we're going to win this.
We have everything we need.
Some still doubt that we have the will to act, but I say the will to act is itself a renewable resource.
Thank you very much.
(Applause) Chris Anderson: You've got this incredible combination of skills.
You've got this scientist mind that can understand the full range of issues, and the ability to turn it into the most vivid language.
No one else can do that, that's why you led this thing.
It was amazing to see it 10 years ago, it was amazing to see it now.
Al Gore: Well, you're nice to say that, Chris.
But honestly, I have a lot of really good friends in the scientific community who are incredibly patient and who will sit there and explain this stuff to me over and over and over again until I can get it into simple enough language that I can understand it.
And that's the key to trying to communicate.
CA: So, your talk. First part: terrifying, second part: incredibly hopeful.
How do we know that all those graphs, all that progress, is enough to solve what you showed in the first part?
AG: I think that the crossing -- you know, I've only been in the business world for 15 years.
But one of the things I've learned is that apparently it matters if a new product or service is more expensive than the incumbent, or cheaper than.
Turns out, it makes a difference if it's cheaper than.
(Laughter) And when it crosses that line, then a lot of things really change.
We are regularly surprised by these developments.
The late Rudi Dornbusch, the great economist said, "Things take longer to happen then you think they will, and then they happen much faster than you thought they could."
I really think that's where we are.
Some people are using the phrase "The Solar Singularity" now, meaning when it gets below the grid parity, unsubsidized in most places, then it's the default choice.
Now, in one of the presentations yesterday, the jitney thing, there is an effort to use regulations to slow this down.
And I just don't think it's going to work.
There's a woman in Atlanta, Debbie Dooley, who's the Chairman of the Atlanta Tea Party.
They enlisted her in this effort to put a tax on solar panels and regulations.
And she had just put solar panels on her roof and she didn't understand the request.
(Laughter) And so she went and formed an alliance with the Sierra Club and they formed a new organization called the Green Tea Party.
(Laughter) (Applause) And they defeated the proposal.
So, finally, the answer to your question is, this sounds a little corny and maybe it's a cliché, but 10 years ago -- and Christiana referred to this -- there are people in this audience who played an incredibly significant role in generating those exponential curves.
And it didn't work out economically for some of them, but it kick-started this global revolution.
And what people in this audience do now with the knowledge that we are going to win this.
But it matters a lot how fast we win it.
CA: Al Gore, that was incredibly powerful.
If this turns out to be the year, that the partisan thing changes, as you said, it's no longer a partisan issue, but you bring along people from the other side together, backed by science, backed by these kinds of investment opportunities, backed by reason that you win the day -- boy, that's really exciting.
Thank you so much.
AG: Thank you so much for bringing me back to TED.
Thank you!
(Applause)
You work at the college library.
You're in the middle of a quiet afternoon when suddenly a shipment of 1,280 different books arrives.
The books have been dropped of in one long straight line, but they're all out of order, and the automatic sorting system is broken.
To make matters worse, classes start tomorrow, which means that first thing in the morning, students will show up in droves looking for these books.
How can you get them all sorted in time?
One way would be to start at one end of the line with the first pair of books.
If the first two books are in order, then leave them as they are.
Otherwise, swap them.
Then, look at the second and third books, repeat the process, and continue until you reach the end of the line.
At some point, you'll come across the book that should be last, and keep swapping it with every subsequent book, moving it down the line until it reaches the end where it belongs.
Then, start from the beginning and repeat the process to get the second to last book in its proper place, and keep going until all books are sorted.
This approach is called Bubble Sort.
It's simple but slow.
You'd make 1,279 comparisons in the first round, then 1,278, and so on, adding up to 818,560 comparisons.
If each took just one second, the process would take over nine days.
A second strategy would be to start by sorting just the first two books.
Then, take the third book and compare it with the book in the second spot.
If it belongs before the second book, swap them, then compare it with the book in the first spot, and swap again if needed.
Now you've sorted the first three books.
Keep adding one book at a time to the sorted sub-line, comparing and swapping the new book with the one before it until it's correctly placed among the books sorted so far.
This is called Insertion Sort.
Unlike Bubble Sort, it usually doesn't require comparing every pair of books.
On average, we'd expect to only need to compare each book to half of the books that came before it.
In that case, the total number of comparisons would be 409,280, taking almost five days.
You're still doing way too many comparisons.
Here's a better idea.
First, pick a random book.
Call it the partition and compare it to every other book.
Then, divide the line by placing all the books that come before the partition on its left and all the ones that come after it on its right.
You've just saved loads of time by not having to compare any of the books on the left to any of the ones on the right ever again.
Now, looking only at the books on the left, you can again pick a random partition book and separate those books that come before it from those that come after it.
You can keep creating sub-partitions like this until you have a bunch of small sub-lines, each of which you'd sort quickly using another strategy, like Insertion Sort.
Each round of partitioning requires about 1,280 comparisons.
If your partitions are pretty balanced, dividing the books into 128 sub-lines of ten would take about seven rounds, or 8,960 seconds.
Sorting these sub-lines would add about 22 seconds each.
All in all, this method known as QuickSort could sort the books in under three and a half hours.
But there's a catch.
Your partitions could end up lopsided, saving no time at all.
Luckily, this rarely happens.
That's why QuickSort is one of the most efficient strategies used by programmers today.
They use it for things like sorting items in an online store by price, or creating a list of all the gas stations close to a given location sorted by distance.
In your case, you're done quick sorting with time to spare.
Just another high-stakes day in the library.
With every year, machines surpass humans in more and more activities we once thought only we were capable of.
Today's computers can beat us in complex board games, transcribe speech in dozens of languages, and instantly identify almost any object.
But the robots of tomorrow may go futher by learning to figure out what we're feeling.
And why does that matter?
Because if machines and the people who run them can accurately read our emotional states, they may be able to assist us or manipulate us at unprecedented scales.
But before we get there, how can something so complex as emotion be converted into mere numbers, the only language machines understand?
Essentially the same way our own brains interpret emotions, by learning how to spot them.
American psychologist Paul Ekman identified certain universal emotions whose visual cues are understood the same way across cultures.
For example, an image of a smile signals joy to modern urban dwellers and aboriginal tribesmen alike.
And according to Ekman, anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise are equally recognizable.
As it turns out, computers are rapidly getting better at image recognition thanks to machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks.
These consist of artificial nodes that mimic our biological neurons by forming connections and exchanging information.
To train the network, sample inputs pre-classified into different categories, such as photos marked happy or sad, are fed into the system.
The network then learns to classify those samples by adjusting the relative weights assigned to particular features.
The more training data it's given, the better the algorithm becomes at correctly identifying new images.
This is similar to our own brains, which learn from previous experiences to shape how new stimuli are processed.
Recognition algorithms aren't just limited to facial expressions.
Our emotions manifest in many ways.
There's body language and vocal tone, changes in heart rate, complexion, and skin temperature, or even word frequency and sentence structure in our writing.
You might think that training neural networks to recognize these would be a long and complicated task until you realize just how much data is out there, and how quickly modern computers can process it.
From social media posts, uploaded photos and videos, and phone recordings, to heat-sensitive security cameras and wearables that monitor physiological signs, the big question is not how to collect enough data, but what we're going to do with it.
There are plenty of beneficial uses for computerized emotion recognition.
Robots using algorithms to identify facial expressions can help children learn or provide lonely people with a sense of companionship.
Social media companies are considering using algorithms to help prevent suicides by flagging posts that contain specific words or phrases.
And emotion recognition software can help treat mental disorders or even provide people with low-cost automated psychotherapy.
Despite the potential benefits, the prospect of a massive network automatically scanning our photos, communications, and physiological signs is also quite disturbing.
What are the implications for our privacy when such impersonal systems are used by corporations to exploit our emotions through advertising?
And what becomes of our rights if authorities think they can identify the people likely to commit crimes before they even make a conscious decision to act?
Robots currently have a long way to go in distinguishing emotional nuances, like irony, and scales of emotions, just how happy or sad someone is.
Nonetheless, they may eventually be able to accurately read our emotions and respond to them.
Whether they can empathize with our fear of unwanted intrusion, however, that's another story.
Professor Fukanō, the famous eccentric scientist and adventurer, has embarked on a new challenge: flying around the world nonstop in a plane of his own design.
Able to travel consistently at the incredible speed of one degree longitude around the equator per minute, the plane would take six hours to circle the world.
There's just one problem: the plane can only hold 180 kiloliters of fuel, only enough for exactly half the journey.
Let's be honest.
The professor probably could have designed the plane to hold more fuel, but where's the fun in that?
Instead, he's devised a slightly more elaborate solution: building three identical planes for the mission.
In addition to their speed, the professor's equipped them with a few other incredible features.
Each of the planes can turn on a dime and instantly transfer any amount of its fuel to any of the others in midair without slowing down, provided they're next to each other.
The professor will pilot the first plane, while his two assistants Fugōri and Orokana will pilot each of the others.
However, only one airport, located on the equator, has granted permission for the experiment, making it the starting point, the finish line, and the only spot where the planes can land, takeoff, or refuel on the ground.
How should the three planes coordinate so the professor can fly continuously for the whole trip and achieve his dream without anyone running out of fuel and crashing?
Pause here if you want to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 According to the professor's calculations, they should be able to pull it off by a hair.
The key is to maximize the support each assistant provides, not wasting a single kiloliter of fuel.
It also helps us to think symmetrically so they can make shorter trips in either direction while setting the professor up for a long unsupported stretch in the middle.
Here's his solution.
All three planes take off at noon flying west, each fully loaded with 180 kiloliters.
After 45 minutes, or one-eighth of the way around, each plane has 135 kiloliters left.
Orokana gives 45 to the professor and 45 to Fugōri, fully refueling them both.
With her remaining 45, Orokana returns to the airport and heads to the lounge for a well-deserved break.
45 minutes later, with one-quarter of the trip complete, the professor and Fugōri are both at 135 kiloliters again.
Fugōri transfers 45 into the professor's tank, leaving himself with the 90 he needs to return.
Professor Fukanō stretches and puts on his favorite album.
He'll be alone for a while.
In the meantime, Orokana has been anxiously awaiting Fugōri's return, her plane fully refueled and ready to go.
As soon as his plane touches the ground, she takes off, this time flying east.
At this point, exactly 180 minutes have passed and the professor is at the halfway point of his journey with 90 kiloliters of fuel left.
For the next 90 minutes, the professor and Orokana's planes fly towards each other, meeting at the three-quarter mark.
Just as the professor's fuel is about the run out, he sees Orokana's plane.
She gives him 45 kiloliters of her remaining 90, leaving them with 45 each.
But that's just half of what they need to make it to the airport.
Fortunately, this is exactly when Fugōri, having refueled, takes off.
45 minutes later, just as the other two planes are about to run empty, he meets them at the 315 degree point and transfers 45 kiloliters of fuel to each, leaving 45 for himself.
All three planes land at the airport just as their fuel gauges reach zero.
As the reporters and photographers cheer, the professor promises his planes will soon be available for commercial flights, just as soon as they figure out how to keep their inflight meals from spilling everywhere.
What do you think when you look at me?
A woman of faith? An expert?
Maybe even a sister.
Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist.
Or just an airport security line delay.
That one's actually true.
(Laughter) If some of your perceptions were negative, I don't really blame you.
That's just how the media has been portraying people who look like me.
One study found that 80 percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative.
And studies show that Americans say that most don't know a Muslim.
I guess people don't talk to their Uber drivers.
(Laughter) Well, for those of you who have never met a Muslim, it's great to meet you.
Let me tell you who I am.
I'm a mom, a coffee lover -- double espresso, cream on the side.
I'm an introvert.
I'm a wannabe fitness fanatic.
And I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslim.
But not like Lady Gaga says, because baby, I wasn't born this way.
It was a choice.
When I was 17, I decided to come out.
No, not as a gay person like some of my friends, but as a Muslim, and decided to start wearing the hijab, my head covering.
My feminist friends were aghast: "Why are you oppressing yourself?"
The funny thing was, it was actually at that time a feminist declaration of independence from the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old, to conform to a perfect and unattainable standard of beauty.
I didn't just passively accept the faith of my parents.
I wrestled with the Quran.
I read and reflected and questioned and doubted and, ultimately, believed.
My relationship with God -- it was not love at first sight.
It was a trust and a slow surrender that deepened with every reading of the Quran.
Its rhythmic beauty sometimes moves me to tears.
I see myself in it. I feel that God knows me.
Have you ever felt like someone sees you, completely understands you and yet loves you anyway?
That's how it feels.
And so later, I got married, and like all good Egyptians, started my career as an engineer.
(Laughter) I later had a child, after getting married, and I was living essentially the Egyptian-American dream.
And then that terrible morning of September, 2001.
I think a lot of you probably remember exactly where you were that morning.
I was sitting in my kitchen finishing breakfast, and I look up on the screen and see the words "Breaking News."
There was smoke, airplanes flying into buildings, people jumping out of buildings.
What was this?
An accident?
A malfunction?
My shock quickly turned to outrage.
Who would do this?
And I switch the channel and I hear, "... Muslim terrorist ...," "... in the name of Islam ...," "... Middle-Eastern descent ...," "... jihad ...," "... we should bomb Mecca."
Oh my God.
Not only had my country been attacked, but in a flash, somebody else's actions had turned me from a citizen to a suspect.
That same day, we had to drive across Middle America to move to a new city to start grad school.
And I remember sitting in the passenger seat as we drove in silence, crouched as low as I could go in my seat, for the first time in my life, afraid for anyone to know I was a Muslim.
We moved into our apartment that night in a new town in what felt like a completely different world.
And then I was hearing and seeing and reading warnings from national Muslim organizations saying things like, "Be alert," "Be aware," "Stay in well-lit areas," "Don't congregate."
I stayed inside all week.
And then it was Friday that same week, the day that Muslims congregate for worship.
And again the warnings were, "Don't go that first Friday, it could be a target."
And I was watching the news, wall-to-wall coverage.
Emotions were so raw, understandably, and I was also hearing about attacks on Muslims, or people who were perceived to be Muslim, being pulled out and beaten in the street.
Mosques were actually firebombed.
And I thought, we should just stay home.
And yet, something didn't feel right.
Because those people who attacked our country attacked our country.
I get it that people were angry at the terrorists.
Guess what? So was I.
And so to have to explain yourself all the time isn't easy.
I don't mind questions. I love questions.
It's the accusations that are tough.
Today we hear people actually saying things like, "There's a problem in this country, and it's called Muslims.
When are we going to get rid of them?"
So, some people want to ban Muslims and close down mosques.
They talk about my community kind of like we're a tumor in the body of America.
And the only question is, are we malignant or benign?
You know, a malignant tumor you extract altogether, and a benign tumor you just keep under surveillance.
The choices don't make sense, because it's the wrong question.
Muslims, like all other Americans, aren't a tumor in the body of America, we're a vital organ.
(Applause) Thank you.
(Applause) Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic athletes.
Now, is closing down mosques going to make America safer?
It might free up some parking spots, but it will not end terrorism.
Going to a mosque regularly is actually linked to having more tolerant views of people of other faiths and greater civic engagement.
And as one police chief in the Washington, DC area recently told me, people don't actually get radicalized at mosques.
They get radicalized in their basement or bedroom, in front of a computer.
And what you find about the radicalization process is it starts online, but the first thing that happens is the person gets cut off from their community, from even their family, so that the extremist group can brainwash them into believing that they, the terrorists, are the true Muslims, and everyone else who abhors their behavior and ideology are sellouts or apostates.
So if we want to prevent radicalization, we have to keep people going to the mosque.
Now, some will still argue Islam is a violent religion.
After all, a group like ISIS bases its brutality on the Quran.
Now, as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I think we need to do everything we can to stop a group like ISIS.
But we would be giving in to their narrative if we cast them as representatives of a faith of 1.6 billion people.
(Applause) Thank you.
ISIS has as much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan has to do with Christianity.
(Applause) Both groups claim to base their ideology on their holy book.
But when you look at them, they're not motivated by what they read in their holy book.
It's their brutality that makes them read these things into the scripture.
Recently, a prominent imam told me a story that really took me aback.
He said that a girl came to him because she was thinking of going to join ISIS.
And I was really surprised and asked him, had she been in contact with a radical religious leader?
And he said the problem was quite the opposite, that every cleric that she had talked to had shut her down and said that her rage, her sense of injustice in the world, was just going to get her in trouble.
And so with nowhere to channel and make sense of this anger, she was a prime target to be exploited by extremists promising her a solution.
What this imam did was to connect her back to God and to her community.
He didn't shame her for her rage -- instead, he gave her constructive ways to make real change in the world.
What she learned at that mosque prevented her from going to join ISIS.
I've told you a little bit about how Islamophobia affects me and my family.
But how does it impact ordinary Americans?
How does it impact everyone else?
How does consuming fear 24 hours a day affect the health of our democracy, the health of our free thought?
Well, one study -- actually, several studies in neuroscience -- show that when we're afraid, at least three things happen.
We become more accepting of authoritarianism, conformity and prejudice.
One study showed that when subjects were exposed to news stories that were negative about Muslims, they became more accepting of military attacks on Muslim countries and policies that curtail the rights of American Muslims.
Now, this isn't just academic.
When you look at when anti-Muslim sentiment spiked between 2001 and 2013, it happened three times, but it wasn't around terrorist attacks.
It was in the run up to the Iraq War and during two election cycles.
So Islamophobia isn't just the natural response to Muslim terrorism as I would have expected.
It can actually be a tool of public manipulation, eroding the very foundation of a free society, which is rational and well-informed citizens.
Muslims are like canaries in the coal mine.
We might be the first to feel it, but the toxic air of fear is harming us all.
(Applause) And assigning collective guilt isn't just about having to explain yourself all the time.
Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.
Deah was an athlete.
He was in dental school, talented, promising ...
And his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous human being she knew.
She was visiting him there and he showed her his resume, and she was amazed.
She said, "When did my baby brother become such an accomplished young man?"
Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit to her brother and his new wife, their neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered them, as well as Yusor's sister, Razan, who was visiting for the afternoon, in their apartment, execution style, after posting anti-Muslim statements on his Facebook page.
He shot Deah eight times.
So bigotry isn't just immoral, it can even be lethal.
So, back to my story.
What happened after 9/11?
Did we go to the mosque or did we play it safe and stay home?
Well, we talked it over, and it might seem like a small decision, but to us, it was about what kind of America we wanted to leave for our kids: one that would control us by fear or one where we were practicing our religion freely.
So we decided to go to the mosque.
And we put my son in his car seat, buckled him in, and we drove silently, intensely, to the mosque.
I took him out, I took off my shoes, I walked into the prayer hall and what I saw made me stop.
The place was completely full.
And then the imam made an announcement, thanking and welcoming our guests, because half the congregation were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, people of faith and no faith, who had come not to attack us, but to stand in solidarity with us.
(Applause) I just break down at this time.
These people were there because they chose courage and compassion over panic and prejudice.
What will you choose?
What will you choose at this time of fear and bigotry?
Will you play it safe?
Or will you join those who say we are better than that?
Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you so much.
Helen Walters: So Dalia, you seem to have struck a chord.
But I wonder, what would you say to those who might argue that you're giving a TED Talk, you're clearly a deep thinker, you work at a fancy think tank, you're an exception, you're not the rule.
What would you say to those people?
Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't let this stage distract you, I'm completely ordinary.
I'm not an exception.
My story is not unusual.
I am as ordinary as they come.
When you look at Muslims around the world -- and I've done this, I've done the largest study ever done on Muslims around the world -- people want ordinary things.
They want prosperity for their family, they want jobs and they want to live in peace.
So I am not in any way an exception.
When you meet people who seem like an exception to the rule, oftentimes it's that the rule is broken, not that they're an exception to it.
HW: Thank you so much. Dalia Mogahed.
(Applause)
Imagine, for a second, a duck teaching a French class, a ping-pong match in orbit around a black hole, a dolphin balancing a pineapple.
You probably haven't actually seen any of these things, but you could imagine them instantly.
How does your brain produce an image of something you've never seen?
That may not seem hard, but that's only because we're so used to doing it.
It turns out that this is actually a complex problem that requires sophisticated coordination inside your brain.
That's because to create these new, weird images, your brain takes familiar pieces and assembles them in new ways, like a collage made from fragments of photos.
The brain has to juggle a sea of thousands of electrical signals getting them all to their destination at precisely the right time.
When you look at an object, thousands of neurons in your posterior cortex fire.
These neurons encode various characteristics of the object: spiky, fruit, brown, green, and yellow.
This synchronous firing strengthens the connections between that set of neurons, linking them together into what's known as a neuronal ensemble, in this case the one for pineapple.
In neuroscience, this is called the Hebbian principle, neurons that fire together wire together.
If you try to imagine a pineapple later, the whole ensemble will light up, assembling a complete mental image.
Dolphins are encoded by a different neuronal ensemble.
In fact, every object that you've seen is encoded by a neuronal ensemble associated with it, the neurons wired together by that synchronized firing.
But this principle doesn't explain the infinite number of objects that we can conjure up in our imaginations without ever seeing them.
The neuronal ensemble for a dolphin balancing a pineapple doesn't exist.
So how come you can imagine it anyway?
One hypothesis, called the Mental Synthesis Theory, says that, again, timing is key.
If the neuronal ensembles for the dolphin and pineapple are activated at the same time, we can perceive the two separate objects as a single image.
But something in your brain has to coordinate that firing.
One plausible candidate is the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in all complex cognitive functions.
Prefrontal cortex neurons are connected to the posterior cortex by long, spindly cell extensions called neural fibers.
The mental synthesis theory proposes that like a puppeteer pulling the strings, the prefrontal cortex neurons send electrical signals down these neural fibers to multiple ensembles in the posterior cortex.
This activates them in unison.
If the neuronal ensembles are turned on at the same time, you experience the composite image just as if you'd actually seen it.
This conscious purposeful synchronization of different neuronal ensembles by the prefrontal cortex is called mental synthesis.
In order for mental sythesis to work, signals would have to arrive at both neuronal ensembles at the same time.
The problem is that some neurons are much farther away from the prefrontal cortex than others.
If the signals travel down both fibers at the same rate, they'd arrive out of sync.
You can't change the length of the connections, but your brain, especially as it develops in childhood, does have a way to change the conduction velocity.
Neural fibers are wrapped in a fatty substance called myelin.
Myelin is an insulator and speeds up the electrical signals zipping down the nerve fiber.
Some neural fibers have as many as 100 layers of myelin.
Others only have a few.
And fibers with thicker layers of myelin can conduct signals 100 times faster or more than those with thinner ones.
Some scientists now think that this difference in myelination could be the key to uniform conduction time in the brain, and consequently, to our mental synthesis ability.
A lot of this myelination happens in childhood, so from an early age, our vibrant imaginations may have a lot to do with building up brains whose carefully myelinated connections can craft creative symphonies throughout our lives.
Today I wanted to -- well, this morning -- I want to talk about the future of human-driven transportation; about how we can cut congestion, pollution and parking by getting more people into fewer cars; and how we can do it with the technology that's in our pockets.
And yes, I'm talking about smartphones ...
not self-driving cars.
But to get started we've got to go back over 100 years.
Because it turns out there was an Uber way before Uber.
And if it had survived, the future of transportation would probably already be here.
So let me introduce you to the jitney.
In 1914 it was created or invented by a guy named LP Draper.
He was a car salesman from LA, and he had an idea.
Well, he was cruising around downtown Los Angeles, my hometown, and he saw trolleys with long lines of people trying to get to where they wanted to go.
He said, well, why don't I just put a sign on my car that takes people wherever they want to go for a jitney -- that was slang for a nickel.
And so people jumped on board, and not just in Los Angeles but across the country.
And within one year, by 1915, there were 50,000 rides per day in Seattle, 45,000 rides per day in Kansas and 150,000 rides per day in Los Angeles.
To give you some perspective, Uber in Los Angeles is doing 157,000 rides per day, today ...
100 years later.
And so these are the trolley guys, the existing transportation monopoly at the time.
They were clearly not happy about the jitney juggernaut.
And so they got to work and they went to cities across the country and got regulations put in place to slow down the growth of the jitney.
And there were all kinds of regulations.
There were licenses -- often they were pricey.
In some cities, if you were a jitney driver, you were required to be in the jitney for 16 hours a day.
In other cities, they required two jitney drivers for one jitney.
But there was a really interesting regulation which was they had to put a backseat light -- install it in every Jitney -- to stop a new pernicious innovation which they called spooning.
(Laughter) All right. So what happened?
Well, within a year this thing had taken off.
But the jitney, by 1919, was regulated completely out of existence.
That's unfortunate ...
because, well, when you can't share a car, then you have to own one.
And car ownership skyrocketed and it's no wonder that by 2007, there was a car for every man, woman and child in the United States.
And that phenomenon had gone global.
In China by 2011, there were more car sales happening in China than in the US.
Now, all this private ownership of course had a public cost.
In the US, we spend 7 billion hours a year, wasted, sitting in traffic.
160 billion dollars in lost productivity, of course also sitting in traffic, and one-fifth of all of our carbon footprint is spewed out in the air by those cars that we're sitting in.
Now, that's only four percent of our problem though.
Because if you have to own a car then that means 96 percent of the time your car is sitting idle.
And so, up to 30 percent of our land and our space is used storing these hunks of steel.
We even have skyscrapers built for cars.
That's the world we live in today.
Now, cities have been dealing with this problem for decades.
It's called mass transit.
And even in a city like New York City, one of the most densely populated in the world and one of the most sophisticated mass transit systems in the world, there are still 2.5 million cars that go over those bridges every day.
Why is that?
Well, it's because mass transit hasn't yet figured out how to get to everybody's doorstep.
And so back in San Francisco, where I live, the situation's much worse, in fact, much worse around the world.
And so the beginning of Uber in 2010 was -- well, we just wanted to push a button and get a ride.
We didn't have any grand ambitions.
But it just turned out that lots of people wanted to push a button and get a ride, and ultimately what we started to see was a lot of duplicate rides.
We saw a lot of people pushing the same button at the same time going essentially to the same place.
And so we started thinking about, well, how do we make those two trips and turn them into one.
Because if we did, that ride would be a lot cheaper -- up to 50 percent cheaper -- and of course for the city you've got a lot more people and a lot fewer cars.
And so the big question for us was: would it work?
Could you have a cheaper ride cheap enough that people would be willing to share it?
And the answer, fortunately, is a resounding yes.
In San Francisco, before uberPOOL, we had -- well, everybody would take their car wherever the heck they wanted.
And the bright colors is where we have the most cars.
And once we introduced uberPOOL, well, you see there's not as many bright colors.
More people getting around the city in fewer cars, taking cars off the road.
It looks like uberPOOL is working.
And so we rolled it out in Los Angeles eight months ago.
And since then, we've taken 7.9 million miles off the roads and we've taken 1.4 thousand metric tons of CO2 out of the air.
But the part that I'm really -- (Applause) But my favorite statistic -- remember, I'm from LA, I spent years of my life sitting behind the wheel, going, "How do we fix this?" -- my favorite part is that eight months later, we have added 100,000 new people that are carpooling every week.
Now, in China everything is supersized, and so we're doing 15 million uberPOOL trips per month, that's 500,000 per day.
And of course we're seeing that exponential growth happen.
In fact, we're seeing it in LA, too.
And when I talk to my team, we don't talk about, "Hey, well, 100,000 people carpooling every week and we're done."
How do we get that to a million?
And in China, well, that could be several million.
And so uberPOOL is a very great solution for urban carpooling.
But what about the suburbs?
This is the street where I grew up in Los Angeles, it's actually a suburb called Northridge, California, and, well -- look, those mailboxes, they kind of just go on forever.
And every morning at about the same time, cars roll of out their driveway, most of them, one person in the car, and they go to work, they go to their place of work.
So the question for us is: well, how do we turn all of these commuter cars -- and literally there's tens of millions of them -- how do we turn all these commuter cars into shared cars?
Well, we have something for this that we recently launched called uberCOMMUTE.
You get up in the morning, get ready for work, get your coffee, go to your car and you light up the Uber app, and all of a sudden, you become an Uber driver.
And we'll match you up with one of your neighbors on your way to work and it's a really great thing.
There's just one hitch ...
it's called regulation.
So 54 cents a mile, what is that?
Well, that is what the US government has determined that the cost of owning a car is per mile.
You can pick up anybody in the United States and take them wherever they want to go at a moment's notice, for 54 cents a mile or less.
But if you charge 60 cents a mile, you're a criminal.
But what if for 60 cents a mile we could get half a million more people carpooling in Los Angeles?
And what if at 60 cents a mile we could get 50 million people carpooling in the United States?
If we could, it's obviously something we should do.
And so it goes back to the lesson of the jitney.
If by 1915 this thing was taking off, imagine without the regulations that happened, if that thing could just keep going.
How would our cities be different today?
Would we have parks in the place of parking lots?
Well, we lost that chance.
But technology has given us another opportunity.
Now, I'm as excited as anybody else about self-driving cars but do we have to really wait five, 10 or even 20 years to make our new cities a reality?
With the technology in our pockets today, and a little smart regulation, we can turn every car into a shared car, and we can reclaim our cities starting today.
Thank you.
(Applause) Chris Anderson: Travis, thank you.
Travis Kalanick: Thank you.
CA: You know -- I mean the company you've built is absolutely astounding.
You only just talked about a small part of it here -- a powerful part -- the idea of turning cars into public transport like that, it's cool.
But I've got a couple other questions because I know they're out there on people's minds.
So first of all, last week I think it was, I switched on my phone and tried to book an Uber and I couldn't find the app.
You had this very radical, very bold, brave redesign.
TK: Sure.
CA: How did it go?
Did you notice other people not finding the app that day?
Are you going to win people over for this redesign?
TK: Well, first I should probably just say, well, what we were trying to accomplish.
And I think if you know a little bit about our history, it makes a lot more sense.
Which is, when we first got started, it was just black cars.
It was literally you push a button and get an S-Class.
And so what we did was almost what I would call an immature version of a luxury brand that looked like a badge on a luxury car.
And as we've gone worldwide and gone from S-Classes to auto rickshaws in India, it became something that was important for us to be more accessible, to be more hyperlocal, to be about the cities we were in and that's what you see with the patterns and colors.
And to be more iconic, because a U doesn't mean anything in Sanskrit, and a U doesn't mean anything in Mandarin.
And so that was a little bit what it was about.
Now, when you first roll out something like that, I mean, your hands are sweating, you've got -- you know, you're a little worried.
What we saw is a lot of people -- actually, at the beginning, we saw a lot more people opening the app because they were curious what they would find when they opened it.
And our numbers were slightly up from what we expected.
CA: OK, that's cool.
Now, so you, yourself, are something of an enigma, I would say.
Your supporters and investors, who have been with you the whole way, believe that the only chance of sort of taking on the powerful, entrenched interests of taxi industry and so forth, is to have someone who is a fierce, relentless competitor, which you've certainly proved to be.
Some people feel you've almost taken that culture too far, and you know -- like a year or two ago there was a huge controversy where a lot of women got upset.
How did it feel like inside the company during that period?
Did you notice a loss of business?
Did you learn anything from that?
TK: Well, look, I think -- I've been an entrepreneur since I've been in high school and you have -- In various different ways an entrepreneur will see hard times and for us, it was about a year and a half ago, and for us it was hard times, too.
Now, inside, we felt like -- I guess at the end of the day we felt like we were good people doing good work, but on the outside that wasn't evident.
And so there was a lot that we had to do to sort of -- We'd gone from a very small company -- I mean if you go literally two and a half years ago, our company was 400 people, and today it's 6,500.
And so when you go through that growth, you have to sort of cement your cultural values and talk about them all of the time.
And make sure that people are constantly checking to say, "Are we good people doing good work?"
And if you check those boxes, the next part of that is making sure you're telling your story.
And I think we learned a lot of lessons but I think at the end of it we came out stronger.
But it was certainly a difficult period.
CA: It seems to me, everywhere you turn, you're facing people who occasionally give you a hard time.
Some Uber drivers in New York and elsewhere are mad as hell now because you changed the fees and they can barely -- they claim -- barely afford the deal anymore.
How -- You know, you said that you started this originally -- just the coolness of pressing a button and summoning a ride.
This thing's taken off, you're affecting the whole global economy, basically, at this point.
You're being forced to be, whether you want it or not, a kind of global visionary who's changing the world.
I mean -- who are you?
Do you want that?
Are you ready to go with that and be what that takes?
TK: Well, there's a few things packed in that question, so -- (Laughter) First is on the pricing side -- I mean, keep in mind, right?
UberX, when we first started, was literally 10 or 15 percent cheaper than our black car product.
It's now in many cities, half the price of a taxi.
And we have all the data to show that the divers are making more per hour than they would as taxi drivers.
What happens is when the price goes down, people are more likely to take Uber at different times of the day than they otherwise would have, and they're more likely to use it in places they wouldn't have before.
And what that means for a driver is wherever he or she drops somebody off, they're much more likely to get a pickup and get back in.
And so what that means is more trips per hour, more minutes of the hour where they're productive and actually, earnings come up.
And we have cities where we've done literally five or six price cuts and have seen those price cuts go up over time.
So even in New York -- We have a blog post we call "4 Septembers" -- compare the earnings September after September after September.
Same month every year.
And we see the earnings going up over time as the price comes down.
And there's a perfect price point -- you can't go down forever.
And in those places where we bring the price down but we don't see those earnings pop, we bring the prices back up.
So that addresses that first part.
And then the enigma and all of this -- I mean, the kind of entrepreneur I am is one that gets really excited about solving hard problems.
And the way I like to describe it is it's kind of like a math professor.
You know? If a math professor doesn't have hard problems to solve, that's a really sad math professor.
And so at Uber we like the hard problems and we like getting excited about those and solving them.
But we don't want just any math problem, we want the hardest ones that we can possibly find, and we want the one that if you solve it, there's a little bit of a wow factor.
CA: In a couple years' time -- say five years' time, I don't know when -- you roll out your incredible self-driving cars, at probably a lower cost than you currently pay for an Uber ride.
What do you say to your army of a million drivers plus at that time?
TK: Explain that again -- at which time?
CA: At the time when self-driving cars are coming -- TK: Sure, sure, sure. Sorry, I missed that.
CA: What do you say to a driver?
TK: Well, look, I think the first part is it's going to take -- it's likely going to take a lot longer than I think some of the hype or media might expect.
That's part one.
Part two is it's going to also take -- there's going to be a long transition.
These cars will work in certain places and not in others.
For us it's an interesting challenge, right?
Because, well -- Google's been investing in this since 2007, Tesla's going to be doing it, Apple's going to be doing it, the manufacturers are going to be doing it.
This is a world that's going to exist, and for good reason.
A million people die a year in cars.
And we already looked at the billions or even trillions of hours worldwide that people are spending sitting in them, driving frustrated, anxious.
And think about the quality of life that improves when you give people their time back and it's not so anxiety-ridden.
So I think there's a lot of good.
And so the way we think about it is that it's a challenge, but one for optimistic leadership, Where instead of resisting -- resisting technology, maybe like the taxi industry, or the trolley industry -- we have to embrace it or be a part of the future.
But how do we optimistically lead through it?
Are there ways to partner with cities?
Are there ways to have education systems, vocational training, etc., for that transition period.
It will take a lot longer than I think we all expect, especially that transition period.
But it is a world that's going to exist, and it is going to be a better world.
CA: Travis, what you're building is absolutely incredible and I'm hugely grateful to you for coming to TED and sharing so openly.
Thank you so much. TK: Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Imagine a brilliant neuroscientist named Mary.
Mary lives in a black and white room, she only reads black and white books, and her screens only display black and white.
But even though she has never seen color, Mary is an expert in color vision and knows everything ever discovered about its physics and biology.
She knows how different wavelengths of light stimulate three types of cone cells in the retina, and she knows how electrical signals travel down the optic nerve into the brain.
There, they create patterns of neural activity that correspond to the millions of colors most humans can distinguish.
Now imagine that one day, Mary's black and white screen malfunctions and an apple appears in color.
For the first time, she can experience something that she's known about for years.
Does she learn anything new?
Is there anything about perceiving color that wasn't captured in all her knowledge?
Philosopher Frank Jackson proposed this thought experiment, called Mary's room, in 1982.
He argued that if Mary already knew all the physical facts about color vision, and experiencing color still teaches her something new, then mental states, like color perception, can't be completely described by physical facts.
The Mary's room thought experiment describes what philosophers call the knowledge argument, that there are non-physical properties and knowledge which can only be discovered through conscious experience.
The knowledge argument contradicts the theory of physicalism, which says that everything, including mental states, has a physical explanation.
To most people hearing Mary's story, it seems intuitively obvious that actually seeing color will be totally different than learning about it.
Therefore, there must be some quality of color vision that transcends its physical description.
The knowledge argument isn't just about color vision.
Mary's room uses color vision to represent conscious experience.
If physical science can't entirely explain color vision, then maybe it can't entirely explain other conscious experiences either.
For instance, we could know every physical detail about the structure and function of someone else's brain, but still not understand what it feels like to be that person.
These ineffable experiences have properties called qualia, subjective qualities that you can't accurately describe or measure.
Qualia are unique to the person experiencing them, like having an itch, being in love, or feeling bored.
Physical facts can't completely explain mental states like this.
Philosophers interested in artificial intelligence have used the knowledge argument to theorize that recreating a physical state won't necessarily recreate a corresponding mental state.
In other words, building a computer which mimicked the function of every single neuron of the human brain won't necessarily create a conscious computerized brain.
Not all philosophers agree that the Mary's room experiment is useful.
Some argue that her extensive knowledge of color vision would have allowed her to create the same mental state produced by actually seeing the color.
The screen malfunction wouldn't show her anything new.
Others say that her knowledge was never complete in the first place because it was based only on those physical facts that can be conveyed in words.
Years after he proposed it, Jackson actually reversed his own stance on his thought experiment.
He decided that even Mary's experience of seeing red still does correspond to a measurable physical event in the brain, not unknowable qualia beyond physical explanation.
But there still isn't a definitive answer to the question of whether Mary would learn anything new when she sees the apple.
Could it be that there are fundamental limits to what we can know about something we can't experience?
And would this mean there are certain aspects of the universe that lie permanently beyond our comprehension?
Or will science and philosophy allow us to overcome our mind's limitations?
What's your sign?
In Western astrology, it's a constellation determined by when your birthday falls in the calendar.
But according to the Chinese zodiac, or shēngxiào, it's your shǔxiàng, meaning the animal assigned to your birth year.
And of the many myths explaining these animal signs and their arrangement, the most enduring one is that of the Great Race.
As the story goes, Yù Dì, or Jade Emperor, Ruler of the Heavens, wanted to devise a way to measure time, so he organized a race.
The first twelve animals to make it across the river would earn a spot on the zodiac calendar in the order they arrived.
The rat rose with the sun to get an early start, but on the way to the river, he met the horse, the tiger, and the ox.
Because the rat was small and couldn't swim very well, he asked the bigger animals for help.
While the tiger and horse refused, the kind-hearted ox agreed to carry the rat across.
Yet, just as they were about to reach the other side, the rat jumped off the ox's head and secured first place.
The ox came in second, with the powerful tiger right behind him.
The rabbit, too small to battle the current, nimbly hopped across stones and logs to come in fourth.
Next came the dragon, who could have flown directly across, but stopped to help some creatures she had encountered on the way.
After her came the horse, galloping across the river.
But just as she got across, the snake slithered by.
The startled horse reared back, letting the snake sneak into sixth place.
The Jade Emperor looked out at the river and spotted the sheep, the monkey, and the rooster all atop a raft, working together to push it through the weeds.
When they made it across, the trio agreed to give eighth place to the sheep, who had been the most comforting and harmonious of them, followed by the monkey and the rooster.
Next came the dog, scrambling onto the shore.
He was a great swimmer, but frolicked in the water for so long that he only managed to come in eleventh.
The final spot was claimed by the pig, who had gotten hungry and stopped to eat and nap before finally waddling across the finish line.
And so, each year is associated with one of the animals in this order, with the cycle starting over every 60 years.
Why 60 and not twelve?
Well, the traditional Chinese calendar is made up of two overlapping systems.
The animals of the zodiac are associated with what's called the Twelve Earthly Branches, or shí'èrzhī.
Another system, the Ten Heavenly Stems, or tiāngān, is linked with the five classical elements of metal, xīn, wood, mù, water, shuǐ, fire, huǒ, and earth, tǔ.
Each element is assigned yīn or yáng, creating a ten-year cycle.
When the twelve animals of the Earthly Branches are matched with the five elements plus the yīn or the yáng of the Heavenly Stems, it creates 60 years of different combinations, known as a sexagenary cycle, or gānzhī.
So someone born in 1980 would have the sign of yáng metal monkey, while someone born in 2007 would be yīn fire pig.
In fact, you can also have an inner animal based on your birth month, a true animal based on your birth date, and a secret animal based on your birth hour.
It was the great race that supposedly determined which animals were enshrined in the Chinese zodiac, but as the system spread through Asia, other cultures made changes to reflect their communities.
So if you consult the Vietnamese zodiac, you may discover that you're a cat, not a rabbit, and if you're in Thailand, a mythical snake called a Naga replaces the dragon.
So whether or not you place stock in what the zodiac says about you as an individual, it certainly reveals much about the culture it comes from.
Approximately 7 million people around the world die from heart attacks every year, and cardiovascular disease, which causes heart attacks and other problems like strokes, is the world's leading killer.
So what causes a heart attack?
Like all muscles, the heart needs oxygen, and during a heart attack, it can't get enough.
Fatty deposits, or plaques, develop on the walls of our coronary arteries.
Those are the vessels that supply oxygenated blood to the heart.
These plaques grow as we age, sometimes getting chunky, hardened, or enflamed.
Eventually, the plaques can turn into blockages.
If one of the plaques ruptures or cracks, a blood clot will form around it in minutes, and a partially closed artery can become completely blocked.
Blood flow is cut off to the cardiac muscle and the oxygen-starved cells start to die within several minutes.
This is a myocardial infarction, or heart attack.
Things can rapidly deteriorate in the absence of treatment.
The injured muscle may not be able to pump blood as well, and its rhythm might be thrown off.
In the worst case scenario, a heart attack can cause sudden death.
And how do you know that someone is having a heart attack?
The most common symptom is chest pain caused by the oxygen-deprived heart muscle.
Patients describe it as crushing or vice-like.
It can radiate to the left arm, jaw, back, or abdomen.
But it's not always as sudden and dramatic as it is in the movies.
Some people experience nausea or shortness of breath.
Symptoms may be less prominent in women and the elderly.
For them, weakness and tiredness may be the main signal.
And surprisingly, in many people, especially those with diabetes, which affects the nerves that carry pain, a heart attack may be silent.
If you think that someone might be having a heart attack, the most important thing is to respond quickly.
If you have access to emergency medical services, call them.
They're the fastest way to get to a hospital.
Taking aspirin, which thins the blood, and nitroglycerin, which opens up the artery, can help keep the heart attack from getting worse.
In the emergency room, doctors can diagnose a heart attack.
They commonly use an electrocardiogram to measure the heart's electrical activity and a blood test to assess heart muscle damage.
The patient is then taken to a high-tech cardiac suite where tests are done to locate the blockages.
Cardiologists can reopen the blocked artery by inflating it with a balloon in a procedure called an angioplasty.
Frequently, they also insert a metal or polymer stent that will hold the artery open.
More extensive blockages might require coronary artery bypass surgery.
Using a piece of vein or artery from another part of the body, heart surgeons can reroute blood flow around the blockage.
These procedures reestablish circulation to the cardiac muscle, restoring heart function.
Heart attack treatment is advancing, but prevention is vital.
Genetics and lifestyle factors both affect your risk.
And the good news is that you can change your lifestyle.
Exercise, a healthy diet, and weight loss all lower the risk of heart attacks, whether you've had one before or not.
Doctors recommend exercising a few times a week, doing both aerobic activity and strength training.
A heart-healthy diet is low in sugar and saturated fats, which are both linked to heart disease.
So what should you eat?
Lots of fiber from vegetables, chicken and fish instead of red meat, whole grains and nuts like walnuts and almonds all seem to be beneficial.
A good diet and exercise plan can also keep your weight in a healthy range, which will lower your heart attack risk as well.
And of course, medications can also help prevent heart attacks.
Doctors often prescribe low-dose aspirin, for example, particularly for patients who've already had a heart attack and for those known to be at high risk.
And drugs that help manage risk factors, like high blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes, will make heart attacks less likely, too.
Heart attacks may be common, but they don't have to be inevitable.
A healthy diet, avoiding tobacco use, staying fit, and enjoying plenty of sleep and lots of laughter all go a long way in making sure your body's most important muscle keeps on beating.
Created by logician Raymond Smullyan and popularized by his colleague George Boolos, this riddle has been called the hardest logic puzzle ever.
You and your team have crash-landed on an ancient planet.
The only way off is to appease its three alien overlords, Tee, Eff, and Arr, by giving them the correct artifacts.
Unfortunately, you don't know who is who.
From an inscription, you learn that you may ask three yes or no questions, each addressed to any one lord.
Tee's answers are always true, Eff's are always false, and Arr's answer is random each time.
But there's a problem.
You've deciphered the language enough to ask any question, but you don't know which of the two words 'ozo' and 'ulu' means yes and which means no.
How can you still figure out which alien is which?
Pause here if you want to figure it out for yourself!
Answer in: 3 2 1 At first, this puzzle seems not just hard, but downright impossible.
What good is asking a question if you can neither understand the answer nor know if it's true?
But it can be done.
The key is to carefully formulate our questions so that any answer yields useful information.
First of all, we can get around to not knowing what 'ozo' and 'ulu' mean by including the words themselves in the questions, and secondly, if we load each question with a hypothetical condition, whether an alien is lying or not won't actually matter.
To see how that could work, imagine our question is whether two plus two is four.
Instead of posing it directly, we say, "If I asked you whether two plus two is four, would you answer 'ozo'?"
If 'ozo' means yes and the overlord is Tee, it truthfully replies, "ozo."
But what if we ask Eff?
Well, it would answer "ulu," or no to the embedded question, so it lies and replies 'ozo' instead.
And if 'ozo' actually means no, then the answer to our embedded question is 'ulu,' and both Tee and Eff still reply 'ozo,' each for their own reasons.
If you're confused about why this works, the reason involves logical structure.
A double positive and a double negative both result in a positive.
Now, we can be sure that asking either Tee or Eff a question put this way will yield 'ozo' if the hypothetical question is true and 'ulu' if it's false regardless of what each word actually means.
Unfortunately, this doesn't help us with Arr.
But don't worry, we can use our first question to identify one alien lord that definitely isn't Arr.
Then we can use the second to find out whether its Tee or Eff.
And once we know that, we can ask it to identify one of the others.
So let's begin.
Ask the alien in the middle, "If I asked you whether the overlord on my left is Arr, would you answer 'ozo'?"
If the reply is 'ozo,' there are two possibilities.
You could already be talking to Arr, in which case the answer is meaningless.
But otherwise, you're talking to either Tee or Eff, and as we know, getting 'ozo' from either one means your hypothetical question was correct, and the left overlord is indeed Arr.
Either way, you can be sure the alien on the right is not Arr.
Similarly, if the answer is 'ulu,' then you know the alien on the left can't be Arr.
Now go to the overlord you've determined isn't Arr and ask, "If I asked 'are you Eff?' would you answer 'ozo'?"
Since you don't have to worry about the random possibility, either answer will establish its identity.
Now that you know whether its answers are true or false, ask the same alien whether the center overlord is Arr.
The process of elimination will identify the remaining one.
The satisfied overlords help you repair your ship and you prepare for takeoff.
Allowed one final question, you ask Tee if it's a long way to Earth, and he answers "ozo."
Too bad you still don't know what that means.
Mastering any physical skill, be it performing a pirouette, playing an instrument, or throwing a baseball, takes practice.
Practice is the repetition of an action with the goal of improvement, and it helps us perform with more ease, speed, and confidence.
So what does practice do in our brains to make us better at things?
Our brains have two kinds of neural tissue: grey matter and white matter.
The grey matter processes information in the brain, directing signals and sensory stimuli to nerve cells, while white matter is mostly made up of fatty tissue and nerve fibers.
In order for our bodies to move, information needs to travel from the brain's grey matter, down the spinal cord, through a chain of nerve fibers called axons to our muscles.
So how does practice or repetition affect the inner workings of our brains?
The axons that exist in the white matter are wrapped with a fatty substance called myelin.
And it's this myelin covering, or sheath, that seems to change with practice.
Myelin is similar to insulation on electrical cables.
It prevents energy loss from electrical signals that the brain uses, moving them more efficiently along neural pathways.
Some recent studies in mice suggest that the repetition of a physical motion increases the layers of myelin sheath that insulates the axons.
And the more layers, the greater the insulation around the axon chains, forming a sort of superhighway for information connecting your brain to your muscles.
So while many athletes and performers attribute their successes to muscle memory, muscles themselves don't really have memory.
Rather, it may be the myelination of neural pathways that gives these athletes and performers their edge with faster and more efficient neural pathways.
There are many theories that attempt to quantify the number of hours, days, and even years of practice that it takes to master a skill.
While we don't yet have a magic number, we do know that mastery isn't simply about the amount of hours of practice.
It's also the quality and effectiveness of that practice.
Effective practice is consistent, intensely focused, and targets content or weaknesses that lie at the edge of one's current abilities.
So if effective practice is the key, how can we get the most out of our practice time?
Try these tips.
Focus on the task at hand.
Minimize potential distractions by turning off the computer or TV and putting your cell phone on airplane mode.
In one study, researchers observed 260 students studying.
On average, those students were able to stay on task for only six minutes at a time.
Laptops, smartphones, and particularly Facebook were the root of most distractions.
Start out slowly or in slow-motion.
Coordination is built with repetitions, whether correct or incorrect.
If you gradually increase the speed of the quality repetitons, you have a better chance of doing them correctly.
Next, frequent repetitions with allotted breaks are common practice habits of elite performers.
Studies have shown that many top athletes, musicians, and dancers spend 50-60 hours per week on activities related to their craft.
Many divide their time used for effective practice into multiple daily practice sessions of limited duration.
And finally, practice in your brain in vivid detail.
It's a bit surprising, but a number of studies suggest that once a physical motion has been established, it can be reinforced just by imagining it.
In one study, 144 basketball players were divided into two groups.
Group A physically practiced one-handed free throws while Group B only mentally practiced them.
When they were tested at the end of the two week experiment, the intermediate and experienced players in both groups had improved by nearly the same amount.
As scientists get closer to unraveling the secrets of our brains, our understanding of effective practice will only improve.
In the meantime, effective practice is the best way we have of pushing our individual limits, achieving new heights, and maximizing our potential.
When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was at the core of Zimbabwe's national health policy.
The new government emerged from a long war of independence and immediately proclaimed a socialist agenda: health care services, primary education became essentially free.
A massive expansion of rural health centers placed roughly 80 percent of the population less than a two-hour walk from these facilities, a truly remarkable accomplishment.
In 1980, the year of independence, 25 percent of Zimbabwean children were fully immunized.
By 1990, a mere decade later, this proportion stood at 80 percent.
I felt tremendously privileged to be part of this transformation, a revolution.
The excitement, the camaraderie, was palpable.
Working side by side with brilliant Zimbabweans -- scientists, doctors, activists -- I felt connected not only to an African independence movement, but to a global progressive public health movement.
But there were daunting challenges.
Zimbabwe reported its first AIDS case in 1985, the year I arrived.
I had taken care of a few patients with AIDS in the early 1980s, when I did my medical training at Harlem Hospital, but -- we had no idea what lay in store for Africa.
Infection rate stood at about two percent in my early days there.
These would soar to one out of every four adults by the time I left Harare 17 years later.
By the mid-1990s, I'd told hundreds of people in the prime of life that they were HIV-positive.
I saw colleagues and friends die, my students, hospital patients, die.
In response, my colleagues and I set up a clinic.
We did condom demonstrations.
We launched school education and workplace interventions.
We did research. We counseled the partners of infected men about how to protect themselves.
We worked hard, and at the time, I believed that I was doing my best.
I was providing excellent treatment, such as it was.
But I was not talking about structural change.
Former UN Secretary Kofi Annan has spoken candidly about his personal failure leading to the Rwandan genocide.
In 1994, he was head of the UN peacekeeping department.
At a 10-year memorial for the genocide, he reflected, "I believed at the time I was doing my best, but I realized after the genocide that there was more I could and should have done to sound the alarm and rally support."
The AIDS epidemic caught the health community unprepared, and today, when the World Health Organization estimates that 39 million people have lost their lives to this disease, I'm not alone in feeling remorse and regret at not having done more earlier.
But while living in Zimbabwe, I didn't see my role as an advocacy or a political one.
I was there for my technical skills, both my clinical and my research epidemiology skills.
And in my mind, my job was to take care of patients and to do research to better understand the population patterns of transmission, and I hoped that we'd slow the spread of the virus.
I was aware that socially marginalized populations were at disproportionate risk of getting and dying of AIDS.
And on the sugar plantations, which really more closely resembled feudal fiefdoms than any modern enterprise, 60 percent of pregnant women tested HIV-positive.
I worked to show how getting infected was not a moral failure but instead related to a culture of male superiority, to forced migrant labor and to colonialism.
Whites were largely unscathed.
As health professionals, our tools were pitifully weak: imploring people to change their individual behaviors, use condoms, reduce number of partners.
Infection rates climbed, and when treatment became available in the West, treatment that remains our most potent weapon against this virus, it was unaffordable to the public sector across Africa.
I didn't speak out about the unequal access to these life-saving drugs or about the underlying economic and political systems that were driving infection rates in such huge swaths of the population.
I rationalized my silence by reminding myself that I was a guest in the country, that sounding the alarm could even get me kicked out, keep me from doing good work, taking care of my patients, doing much-needed research.
So I didn't speak out about the government's early stance on AIDS.
I didn't voice my concerns loudly enough.
Many doctors, health professionals, may think I did nothing wrong.
Our pact with our patients, the Hippocratic Oath and its variants, is about the sanctity of the patient-doctor relationship.
And I did everything I could for each and every patient of mine.
But I knew that epidemics emerge along the fissures of our society, reflecting not only biology, but more importantly patterns of marginalization, exclusion, discrimination related to race, gender, sexuality, class and more.
It was true of AIDS.
It was true just recently of Ebola.
Medical anthropologists such as Paul Farmer, who worked on AIDS in Haiti, call this structural violence: structural because inequities are embedded in the political and economic organization of our social world, often in ways that are invisible to those with privilege and power; and violence because its impact -- premature deaths, suffering, illness -- is violent.
We do little for our patients if we fail to recognize these social injustices.
Sounding the alarm is the first step towards doing public health right, and it's how we may rally support to break through and create real change together.
So these days, I'm not staying quiet.
I'm speaking up about a lot of things, even when it makes listeners uncomfortable, even when it makes me uncomfortable.
And a lot of this is about racial disparities and institutionalized racism, things that we're not supposed to have in this country anymore, certainly not in the practice of medicine or public health.
But we have them, and we pay for them in lives cut short.
That's why sounding the alarm about the impact of racism on health in the United States, the ongoing institutional and interpersonal violence that people of color face, compounded by our tragic legacy of 250 years of slavery, 90 years of Jim Crow and 60 years of imperfect equality, sounding the alarm about this is central to doing my job right as New York City's Health Commissioner.
In New York City, premature mortality -- that's death before the age of 65 -- is 50 percent higher for black men than white ones.
A black woman in 2012 faced more than 10 times the risk of dying related to childbirth as a white woman.
And though we've made enormous strides in reducing infant mortality rates, a black baby still faces nearly three times the risk of death in its first year of life as compared to a white baby.
New York City's not exceptional.
These statistics are paralleled by statistics found across the United States.
A recent New York Times analysis reported that there are 1.5 million missing black men across the country.
They noted that more than one out of every six black men who today should be between the ages of 25 and 54 years have disappeared from daily life, lost either to prison or premature death.
There is great injustice in the daily and disproportionate violence faced by young black men, the focus of recent protests under the banner #BlackLivesMatter.
But we have to remember that enduring and disparate rates and the occurrence and outcome of common medical conditions -- heart disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV -- diseases that may kill slowly and quietly and take even more black lives prematurely.
As the #BlackLivesMatter movement unfolded, I felt frustrated and angry that the medical community has been reluctant to even use the word "racism" in our research and our work.
You've probably felt something every time I've said it.
Our medical students held die-ins in their white coats, but the medical community has largely stood by passively as ongoing discrimination continues to affect the disease profile and mortality.
And I worry that the trend towards personalized and precision medicine, looking for biological or genetic targets to better tailor treatment, may inadvertently cause us to lose sight of the big picture, that it is the daily context, where a person lives, grows, works, loves, that most importantly determines population health, and for too many of us, poor health.
As health professionals in our daily work, whether in the clinic or doing research, we are witness to great injustice: the homeless person who is unable to follow medical advice because he has more pressing priorities; the transgender youth who is contemplating suicide because our society is just so harsh; the single mother who has been made to feel that she is responsible for the poor health of her child.
Our role as health professionals is not just to treat our patients but to sound the alarm and advocate for change.
Rightfully or not, our societal position gives our voices great credibility, and we shouldn't waste that.
I regret not speaking up in Zimbabwe, and I've promised myself that as New York City's Health Commissioner, I will use every opportunity I have to sound the alarm and rally support for health equity.
I will speak out against racism, and I hope you will join me, and I will join you when you speak out against sexism or any other form of inequality.
It's time for us to rise up and collectively speak up about structural inequality.
We don't have to have all the answers to call for change.
We just need courage.
The health of our patients, the health of us all, depends on it.
(Applause)
In mythological ancient Greece, soaring above Crete on wings made from wax and feathers, Icarus, the son of Daedalus, defied the laws of both man and nature.
Ignoring the warnings of his father, he rose higher and higher.
To witnesses on the ground, he looked like a god, and as he peered down from above, he felt like one, too.
But, in mythological ancient Greece, the line that separated god from man was absolute and the punishment for mortals who attempted to cross it was severe.
Such was the case for Icarus and Daedalus.
Years before Icarus was born, his father Daedalus was highly regarded as a genius inventor, craftsman, and sculptor in his homeland of Athens.
He invented carpentry and all the tools used for it.
He designed the first bathhouse and the first dance floor.
He made sculptures so lifelike that Hercules mistook them for actual men.
Though skilled and celebrated, Daedalus was egotistical and jealous.
Worried that his nephew was a more skillful craftsman, Daedalus murdered him.
As punishment, Daedalus was banished from Athens and made his way to Crete.
Preceded by his storied reputation, Daedalus was welcomed with open arms by Crete's King Minos.
There, acting as the palace technical advisor, Daedalus continued to push the boundaries.
For the king's children, he made mechanically animated toys that seemed alive.
He invented the ship's sail and mast, which gave humans control over the wind.
With every creation, Daedalus challenged human limitations that had so far kept mortals separate from gods, until finally, he broke right through.
King Minos's wife, Pasiphaë, had been cursed by the god Poseidon to fall in love with the king's prized bull.
Under this spell, she asked Daedalus to help her seduce it.
With characteristic audacity, he agreed.
Daedalus constructed a hollow wooden cow so realistic that it fooled the bull.
With Pasiphaë hiding inside Daedalus's creation, she conceived and gave birth to the half-human half-bull minotaur.
This, of course, enraged the king who blamed Daedalus for enabling such a horrible perversion of natural law.
As punishment, Daedalus was forced to construct an inescapable labyrinth beneath the palace for the minotaur.
When it was finished, Minos then imprisoned Daedalus and his only son Icarus within the top of the tallest tower on the island where they were to remain for the rest of their lives.
But Daedalus was still a genius inventor.
While observing the birds that circled his prison, the means for escape became clear.
He and Icarus would fly away from their prison as only birds or gods could do.
Using feathers from the flocks that perched on the tower, and the wax from candles, Daedalus constructed two pairs of giant wings.
As he strapped the wings to his son Icarus, he gave a warning: flying too near the ocean would dampen the wings and make them too heavy to use.
Flying too near the sun, the heat would melt the wax and the wings would disintegrate.
In either case, they surely would die.
Therefore, the key to their escape would be in keeping to the middle.
With the instructions clear, both men leapt from the tower.
They were the first mortals ever to fly.
While Daedalus stayed carefully to the midway course, Icarus was overwhelmed with the ecstasy of flight and overcome with the feeling of divine power that came with it.
Daedalus could only watch in horror as Icarus ascended higher and higher, powerless to change his son's dire fate.
When the heat from the sun melted the wax on his wings, Icarus fell from the sky.
Just as Daedalus had many times ignored the consequences of defying the natural laws of mortal men in the service of his ego, Icarus was also carried away by his own hubris.
In the end, both men paid for their departure from the path of moderation dearly, Icarus with his life and Daedalus with his regret.
If you can't imagine life without chocolate, you're lucky you weren't born before the 16th century.
Until then, chocolate only existed in Mesoamerica in a form quite different from what we know.
As far back as 1900 BCE, the people of that region had learned to prepare the beans of the native cacao tree.
The earliest records tell us the beans were ground and mixed with cornmeal and chili peppers to create a drink - not a relaxing cup of hot cocoa, but a bitter, invigorating concoction frothing with foam.
And if you thought we make a big deal about chocolate today, the Mesoamericans had us beat.
They believed that cacao was a heavenly food gifted to humans by a feathered serpent god, known to the Maya as Kukulkan and to the Aztecs as Quetzalcoatl.
Aztecs used cacao beans as currency and drank chocolate at royal feasts, gave it to soldiers as a reward for success in battle, and used it in rituals.
The first transatlantic chocolate encounter occurred in 1519 when Hernán Cortés visited the court of Moctezuma at Tenochtitlan.
As recorded by Cortés's lieutenant, the king had 50 jugs of the drink brought out and poured into golden cups.
When the colonists returned with shipments of the strange new bean, missionaries' salacious accounts of native customs gave it a reputation as an aphrodisiac.
At first, its bitter taste made it suitable as a medicine for ailments, like upset stomachs, but sweetening it with honey, sugar, or vanilla quickly made chocolate a popular delicacy in the Spanish court.
And soon, no aristocratic home was complete without dedicated chocolate ware.
The fashionable drink was difficult and time consuming to produce on a large scale.
That involved using plantations and imported slave labor in the Caribbean and on islands off the coast of Africa.
The world of chocolate would change forever in 1828 with the introduction of the cocoa press by Coenraad van Houten of Amsterdam.
Van Houten's invention could separate the cocoa's natural fat, or cocoa butter.
This left a powder that could be mixed into a drinkable solution or recombined with the cocoa butter to create the solid chocolate we know today.
Not long after, a Swiss chocolatier named Daniel Peter added powdered milk to the mix, thus inventing milk chocolate.
By the 20th century, chocolate was no longer an elite luxury but had become a treat for the public.
Meeting the massive demand required more cultivation of cocoa, which can only grow near the equator.
Now, instead of African slaves being shipped to South American cocoa plantations, cocoa production itself would shift to West Africa with Cote d'Ivoire providing two-fifths of the world's cocoa as of 2015.
Yet along with the growth of the industry, there have been horrific abuses of human rights.
Many of the plantations throughout West Africa, which supply Western companies, use slave and child labor, with an estimation of more than 2 million children affected.
This is a complex problem that persists despite efforts from major chocolate companies to partner with African nations to reduce child and indentured labor practices.
Today, chocolate has established itself in the rituals of our modern culture.
Due to its colonial association with native cultures, combined with the power of advertising, chocolate retains an aura of something sensual, decadent, and forbidden.
Yet knowing more about its fascinating and often cruel history, as well as its production today, tells us where these associations originate and what they hide.
So as you unwrap your next bar of chocolate, take a moment to consider that not everything about chocolate is sweet.
Without water, a human can only survive for about 100 hours.
But there's a creature so resilient that it can go without it for decades.
This one millimeter animal can survive both the hottest and coldest environments on Earth, and can even withstand high levels of radiation.
This is the tardigrade, and it's one of the toughest creatures on Earth, even if it does look more like a chubby, eight-legged gummy bear.
Most organisms need water to survive.
Water allows metabolism to occur, which is the process that drives all the biochemical reactions that take place in cells.
But creatures like the tardigrade, also known as the water bear, get around this restriction with a process called anhydrobiosis, from the Greek meaning life without water.
And however extraordinary, tardigrades aren't alone.
Bacteria, single-celled organisms called archaea, plants, and even other animals can all survive drying up.
For many tardigrades, this requires that they go through something called a tun state.
They curl up into a ball, pulling their head and eight legs inside their body and wait until water returns.
It's thought that as water becomes scarce and tardigrades enter their tun state, they start synthesize special molecules, which fill the tardigrade's cells to replace lost water by forming a matrix.
Components of the cells that are sensitive to dryness, like DNA, proteins, and membranes, get trapped in this matrix.
It's thought that this keeps these molecules locked in position to stop them from unfolding, breaking apart, or fusing together.
Once the organism is rehydrated, the matrix dissolves, leaving behind undamaged, functional cells.
Beyond dryness, tardigrades can also tolerate other extreme stresses: being frozen, heated up past the boiling point of water, high levels of radiation, and even the vacuum of outer space.
This has led to some erroneous speculation that tardigrades are extraterrestrial beings.
While that's fun to think about, scientific evidence places their origin firmly on Earth where they've evolved over time.
In fact, this earthly evolution has given rise to over 1100 known species of tardigrades and there are probably many others yet to be discovered.
And because tardigrades are so hardy, they exist just about everywhere.
They live on every continent, including Antarctica.
And they're in diverse biomes including deserts, ice sheets, the sea, fresh water, rainforests, and the highest mountain peaks.
But you can find tardigrades in the most ordinary places, too, like moss or lichen found in yards, parks, and forests.
All you need to find them is a little patience and a microscope.
Scientists are now to trying to find out whether tardigrades use the tun state, their anti-drying technique, to survive other stresses.
If we can understand how they, and other creatures, stabilize their sensitive biological molecules, perhaps we could apply this knowledge to help us stabilize vaccines, or to develop stress-tolerant crops that can cope with Earth's changing climate.
And by studying how tardigrades survive prolonged exposure to the vacuum of outer space, scientists can generate clues about the environmental limits of life and how to safeguard astronauts.
In the process, tardigrades could even help us answer a critical question: could life survive on planets much less hospitable than our own?
Trillions of bacteria, viruses, and fungi live on or inside of us, and maintaining a good, balanced relationship with them is to our advantage.
Together, they form the gut microbiome, a rich ecosystem that performs a variety of functions in our bodies.
The bacteria in our guts can break down food the body can't digest, produce important nutrients, regulate the immune system, and protect against harmful germs.
We don't yet have the blueprint for exactly which good bacteria a robust gut needs, but we do know that it's important for a healthy microbiome to have a variety of bacterial species.
Many factors affect our microbiomes, including our environment, medications like antibiotics, and even whether we were delivered by C-section or not.
Diet, too, is emerging as one of the leading influences on the health of our guts.
And while we can't control all these factors, we can manipulate the balance of our microbes by paying attention to what we eat.
Dietary fiber from foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, and whole grains is the best fuel for gut bacteria.
When bacteria digest fiber, they produce short chain fatty acids that nourish the gut barrier, improve immune function, and can help prevent inflammation, which reduces the risk of cancer.
And the more fiber you ingest, the more fiber-digesting bacteria colonize your gut.
In a recent study, scientists exchanged the regular high-fiber diets of a group of rural South Africans with the high-fat, meat-heavy diets of a group of African-Americans.
After just two weeks on the high-fat, low-fiber, Western-style diet, the rural African group showed increased inflammation of the colon, as well as a decrease of butyrate.
That's a short chain fatty acid thought to lower risk of colon cancer.
Meanwhile, the group that switched to a high-fiber, low-fat diet had the opposite result.
So what goes wrong with our gut bacteria when we eat low-fiber processed foods?
Lower fiber means less fuel for the gut bacteria, essentially starving them until they die off.
This results in less diversity and hungry bacteria.
In fact, some can even start to feed on the mucus lining.
We also know that specific foods can affect gut bacteria.
In one recent microbiome study, scientists found that fruits, vegetables, tea, coffee, red wine, and dark chocolate were correlated with increased bacterial diversity.
These foods contain polyphenols, which are naturally occurring antioxidant compounds.
On the other hand, foods high in dairy fat, like whole milk, and sugar-sweetened sodas were correlated with decreased diversity.
How food is prepared also matters.
Minimally processed, fresh foods generally have more fiber and provide better fuel.
So lightly steamed, sautéed, or raw vegetables are typically more beneficial than fried dishes.
There are also ways of preparing food that can actually introduce good bacteria, also known as probiotics, into your gut.
Fermented foods are teeming with helpful probiotic bacteria, like lactobacillus and bifidobacteria.
Originally used as a way of preserving foods before the invention of refrigeration, fermentation remains a traditional practice all over the world.
Foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, tempeh, and kombucha provide variety and vitality to our diets.
Yogurt is another fermented food that can introduce helpful bacteria into our guts.
That doesn't necessarily mean that all yogurt is good for us, though.
Brands with too much sugar and not enough bacteria may not actually help.
These are just general guidelines.
More research is needed before we fully understand exactly how any of these foods interact with our microbiomes.
We see positive correlations, but the insides of our guts are difficult places to make direct observations.
For instance, we don't currently know whether these foods are directly responsible for the changes in diversity, or if something more complicated is happening.
While we're only beginning to explore the vast wilderness inside our guts, we already have a glimpse of how crucial our microbiomes are for digestive health.
The great news is we have the power to fire up the bacteria in our bellies.
Fill up on fibers, fresh and fermented foods, and you can trust your gut to keep you going strong.
Your research team has found a prehistoric virus preserved in the permafrost and isolated it for study.
After a late night working, you're just closing up the lab when a sudden earthquake hits and knocks out the power.
As the emergency generators kick in, an alarm confirms your worst fears: all the sample vials have broken.
The virus is contained for now, but unless you can destroy it, the vents will soon open and unleash a deadly airborne plague.
Without hesitation, you grab your HazMat suit and get ready to save the world.
The lab is a four by four compound of 16 rooms with an entrance on the northwest corner and an exit at the southeast.
Each room is connected to the adjacent ones by an airlock, and the virus has been released in every room except the entrance.
To destroy it, you must enter each contaminated room and pull its emergency self-destruct switch.
But there's a catch.
Because the security system is on lockdown, once you enter the contaminated room, you can't exit without activating the switch, and once you've done so, you won't be able to go back in to that room.
You start to draw out possible routes on a pad of paper, but nothing seems to get you to the exit without missing at least one room.
So how can you destroy the virus in every contaminated room and survive to tell the story?
Pause here if you want to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If your first instinct is to try to graph your possible moves on a grid, you've got the right idea.
This puzzle is related to the Hamiltonian path problem named after the 19th century Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton.
The challenge of the path problem is to find whether a given graph has a Hamiltonian path.
That's a route that visits every point within it exactly once.
This type of problem, classified as NP-complete, is notoriously difficult when the graph is sufficiently large.
Although any proposed solution can be easily verified, we have no reliable formula or shortcut for finding one, or determining that one exists.
And we're not even sure if it's possible for computers to reliably find such solutions, either.
This puzzle adds a twist to the Hamiltonian path problem in that you have to start and end at specific points.
But before you waste a ton of graph paper, you should know that a true Hamiltonian path isn't possible with these end points.
That's because the rooms form a grid with an even number of rooms on each side.
In any grid with that configuration, a Hamiltonian path that starts and ends in opposite corners is impossible.
Here's one way of understanding why.
Consider a checkerboard grid with an even number of squares on each side.
Every path through it will alternate black and white.
These grids will all also have an even total number of squares because an even number times and even number is even.
So a Hamiltonian path on an even-sided grid that starts on black will have to end on white.
And one that starts on white will have to end on black.
However, in any grid with even numbered sides, opposite corners are the same color, so it's impossible to start and end a Hamiltonian path on opposite corners.
It seems like you're out of luck, unless you look at the rules carefully and notice an important exception.
It's true that once you activate the switch in a contaminated room, it's destroyed and you can never go back.
But there's one room that wasn't contaminated - the entrance.
This means that you can leave it once without pulling the switch and return there when you've destroyed either of these two rooms.
The corner room may have been contaminated from the airlock opening, but that's okay because you can destroy the entrance after your second visit.
That return trip gives you four options for a successful route, and a similar set of options if you destroyed this room first.
Congratulations. You've prevented an epidemic of apocalyptic proportions, but after such a stressful episode, you need a break.
Maybe you should take up that recent job offer to become a traveling salesman.
For the microscopic lab worm, C. elegans life equates to just a few short weeks on Earth.
Compare that with the tortoise, which can age to more than 100 years.
Mice and rats reach the end of their lives after just four years, while for the bowhead whale, Earth's longest-lived mammal, death can come after 200.
Like most living things, the vast majority of animals gradually degenerate after reaching sexual maturity in the process known as aging.
But what does it really mean to age?
The drivers behind this process are varied and complicated, but aging is ultimately caused by cell death and dysfunction.
When we're young, we constantly regenerate cells in order to replace dead and dying ones.
But as we age, this process slows down.
In addition, older cells don't perform their functions as well as young ones.
That makes our bodies go into a decline, which eventually results in disease and death.
But if that's consistently true, why the huge variance in aging patterns and lifespan within the animal kingdom?
The answer lies in several factors, including environment and body size.
These can place powerful evolutionary pressures on animals to adapt, which in turn makes the aging process different across species.
Consider the cold depths of the Atlantic and Arctic Seas, where Greenland sharks can live to over 400 years, and the Arctic clam known as the quahog can live up to 500.
Perhaps the most impressive of these ocean-dwelling ancients is the Antarctic glass sponge, which can survive over 10,000 years in frigid waters.
In cold environments like these, heartbeats and metabolic rates slow down.
Researchers theorize that this also causes a slowing of the aging process.
In this way, the environment shapes longevity.
When it comes to size, it's often, but not always, the case that larger species have a longer lifespan than smaller ones.
For instance, an elephant or whale will live much longer than a mouse, rat, or vole, which in turn have years on flies and worms.
Some small animals, like worms and flies, are also limited by the mechanics of their cell division.
They're mostly made up of cells that can't divide and be replaced when damaged, so their bodies expire more quickly.
And size is a powerful evolutionary driver in animals.
Smaller creatures are more prone to predators.
A mouse, for instance, can hardly expect to survive more than a year in the wild.
So, it has evolved to grow and reproduce more rapidly, like an evolutionary defense mechanism against its shorter lifespan.
Larger animals, by contrast, are better at fending off predators, and so they have the luxury of time to grow to large sizes and reproduce multiple times during their lives.
Exceptions to the size rule include bats, birds, moles, and turtles, but in each case, these animals have other adaptations that allow them to escape predators.
But there are still cases where animals with similar defining features, like size and habitat, age at completely different rates.
In these cases, genetic differences, like how each organism's cells respond to threats, often account for the discrepancies in longevity.
So it's the combination of all these factors playing out to differing degrees in different animals that explains the variability we see in the animal kingdom.
So what about us?
Humans currently have an average life expectancy of 71 years, meaning that we're not even close to being the longest living inhabitants on Earth.
But we are very good at increasing our life expectancy.
In the early 1900s, humans only lived an average of 50 years.
Since then, we've learned to adapt by managing many of the factors that cause deaths, like environmental exposure and nutrition.
This, and other increases in life expectancy make us possibly the only species on Earth to take control over our natural fate.
Why do we buy certain products or choose certain brands?
This is the sort of question advertisers have always asked, and there are no easy answers.
However, there is a handy tool that helps companies explore this and similar questions, and it's called the focus group.
Until the 1940s, market research was often quantitative using things like sales figures and customer polls to track consumption.
But this changed during World War II.
Sociologists Robert Merton and Paul Lazarsfeld set out to learn how unprecedented exposure to wartime propaganda was affecting the public.
Instead of polling large numbers of people with straightforward questions and quantifiable answers, the researchers conducted in-person interviews, sometimes with small groups, engaging them in more open discussions.
Later, this method was picked up by the advertising industry with the help of consultants, like Austrian-born psychologist Ernest Dichter, who first coined the term focus group.
This new technique was a type of qualitative research focused on the nature of people's preferences and thoughts.
It couldn't tell marketers what percentage of people buy a certain product or brand, but it could tell them more about the people who do, their reasoning for doing so, and even the unconscious motivations behind those reasons.
Rather than providing definite conclusions for business and sales, focus groups would be used for exploratory research, generating new ideas for products and marketing based on deeper understanding of consumer habits.
For example, early focus groups found that contrary to popular opinion at the time, wives often had more influence than their husbands when choosing which car to buy, so Chrysler shifted gears by marketing cars directly to women.
And Dr. Dichter himself conducted focus groups for Mattel to learn what girls wanted in a doll.
The result was the original Barbie doll.
So how does a focus group work?
First, companies recruit between six and ten participants according to specific criteria that meet their research objectives.
They could be mothers of children between five and seven, or teenagers planning to buy a new phone in the next three months.
This is often done through professional recruiters who manage lists of people who've agreed to participate in focus groups for payment or other rewards.
During a session, participants are asked to respond to various prompts from the group moderator, like sharing their opinions on a certain product, or their emotional reactions to an advertisement.
They may even be asked to do seemingly unrelated tasks, like imagining brands as animals in a zoo.
The idea is that this can reveal useful information about the participant's feelings that traditional questions might not get to.
Beyond these basics, many variations are possible.
A focus group may have two or more moderators perhaps taking opposite sides on a question, or a researcher might be hidden in the focus group unknown to other participants to see how their answers can be influenced.
And the whole process may also be observed by researchers through a one-way mirror.
But although they can provide valuable insight, focus groups do have their limitations, and one of the main ones is that the simple act of observing something can change it.
This principle is called observer interference.
The answers participants give are likely to be affected by the presence of the researchers, social pressure from the rest of the group, or simply knowing that they're taking part in a focus group.
And because researchers often use a small sample size in a specific setting, it's hard to generalize their results.
The findings that researchers do reach from focus groups are often tested through experiments and data gathering.
Those put numbers on questions like how many potential customers there are and what price they'd be willing to pay.
This part of the process changes as technology evolves.
But focus groups have remained largely the same for decades.
Perhaps when it comes to the big, important questions, there's no substitute for people genuinely interacting with each other.
You're standing at the ready inside the goal when suddenly, you feel an intense itch on the back of your head.
We've all experienced the annoyance of an inconvenient itch, but have you ever pondered why we itch in the first place?
The average person experiences dozens of individual itches each day.
They can be triggered by all sorts of things, including allergic reactions, dryness, and even some diseases.
And then there are the mysterious ones that pop up for no reason at all, or just from talking about itching.
You're scratching your head right now, aren't you?
Anyhow, let's take one of the most common sources: bug bites.
When a mosquito bites you, it releases a compound into your body called an anticoagulant that prevents your blood from clotting.
That compound, which we're mildly allergic to, triggers the release of histamine, a chemical that makes our capillaries swell.
This enables increased blood flow, which helpfully accelerates the body's immune response to this perceived threat.
That explains the swelling, and it's the same reason pollen can make your eyes puff up.
Histamine also activates the nerves involved in itching, which is why bug bites make you scratch.
But the itchy sensation itself isn't yet fully understood.
In fact, much of what we do know comes from studying the mechanics of itching in mice.
Researchers have discovered that itch signals in their skin are transmitted via a subclass of the nerves that are associated with pain.
These dedicated nerves produce a molecule called natriuretic polypetide B, which triggers a signal that's carried up the spinal cord to the brain, where it creates the feeling of an itch.
When we scratch, the action of our fingernails on the skin causes a low level pain signal that overrides the itching sensation.
It's almost like a distraction, which creates the sensation of relief.
But is there actually an evolutionary purpose to the itch, or is it simply there to annoy us?
The leading theory is that our skin has evolved to be acutely aware of touch so that we're equipped to deal with risks from the outside world.
Think about it.
Our automatic scratching response would dislodge anything harmful that's potentially lurking on our skin, like a harmful sting, a biting insect, or the tendrils of a poisonous plant.
This might explain why we don't feel itching inside our bodies, like in our intestines, which is safe from these external threats, though imagine how maddening that would be.
In some people, glitches in the pathways responsible for all of this can cause excessive itching that can actually harm their health.
One extreme example is a psychological condition called delusory parasitosis where people believe their bodies are infested with mites or fleas scurrying over and under their skin, making them itch incessantly.
Another phenomenon called phantom itching can occur in patients who've had amputations.
Because this injury has so severely damaged the nervous system, it confuses the body's normal nerve signaling and creates sensations in limbs that are no longer there.
Doctors are now finding ways to treat these itching anomalies.
In amputees, mirrors are used to reflect the remaining limb, which the patient scratches.
That creates an illusion that tricks the brain into thinking the imaginary itch has been satisfied.
Oddly enough, that actually works.
Researchers are also searching for the genes involved in itching and developing treatments to try and block the pathway of an itch in extreme cases.
If having an unscratchable itch feels like your own personal hell, Dante agreed.
The Italian poet wrote about a section of hell where people were punished by being left in pits to itch for all eternity.
What do these animals have in common?
More than you might think.
Along with over 5,000 other species, they're mammals, or members of class mammalia.
All mammals are vertebrates, meaning they have backbones.
But mammals are distinguished from other vertebrates by a number of shared features.
That includes warm blood, body hair or fur, the ability to breathe using lungs, and nourishing their young with milk.
But despite these similarities, these creatures also have many biological differences, and one of the most remarkable is how they give birth.
Let's start with the most familiar, placental mammals.
This group includes humans, cats, dogs, giraffes, and even the blue whale, the biggest animal on Earth.
Its placenta, a solid disk of blood-rich tissue, attaches to the wall of the uterus to support the developing embryo.
The placenta is what keeps the calf alive during pregnancy.
Directly connected to the mother's blood supply, it funnels nutrients and oxygen straight into the calf's body via the umbilical cord, and also exports its waste.
Placental mammals can spend far longer inside the womb than other mammals.
Baby blue whales, for instance, spend almost a full year inside their mother.
The placenta keeps the calf alive right up until its birth, when the umbilical cord breaks and the newborn's own respiratory, circulatory, and waste disposal systems take over.
Measuring about 23 feet, a newborn calf is already able to swim.
It will spend the next six months drinking 225 liters of its mothers thick, fatty milk per day.
Meanwhile, in Australia, you can find a second type of mammal - marsupials.
Marsupial babies are so tiny and delicate when they're born that they must continue developing in the mother's pouch.
Take the quoll, one of the world's smallest marsupials, which weighs only 18 milligrams at birth, the equivalent of about 30 sugar grains.
The kangaroo, another marsupial, gives birth to a single jelly bean-sized baby at a time.
The baby crawls down the middle of the mother's three vaginas, then must climb up to the pouch, where she spends the next 6-11 months suckling.
Even after the baby kangaroo leaves this warm haven, she'll return to suckle milk.
Sometimes, she's just one of three babies her mother is caring for.
A female kangaroo can often simultaneously support one inside her uterus and another in her pouch.
In unfavorable conditions, female kangaroos can pause their pregnancies.
When that happens, she's able to produce two different kinds of milk, one for her newborn, and one for her older joey.
The word mammalia means of the breast, which is a bit of a misnomer because while kangaroos do produce milk from nipples in their pouches, they don't actually have breasts.
Nor do monotremes, the third and arguably strangest example of mammalian birth.
There were once hundreds of monotreme species, but there are only five left: four species of echidnas and the duck-billed platypus.
The name monotreme means one hole referring to the single orifice they use for reproduction, excretion, and egg-laying.
Like birds, reptiles, fish, dinosaurs, and others, these species lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young.
Their eggs are soft-shelled, and when their babies hatch, they suckle milk from pores on their mother's body until they're large enough to feed themselves.
Despite laying eggs and other adaptations that we associate more with non-mammals, like the duck-bill platypus's webbed feet, bill, and the venomous spur males have on their feet, they are, in fact, mammals.
That's because they share the defining characteristics of mammalia and are evolutionarily linked to the rest of the class.
Whether placental, marsupial, or monotreme, each of these creatures and its unique birthing methods, however bizarre, have succeeded for many millennia in bringing new life and diversity into the mammal kingdom.
I want to tell you the story about the time I almost got kidnapped in the trunk of a red Mazda Miata.
It's the day after graduating from design school and I'm having a yard sale.
And this guy pulls up in this red Mazda and he starts looking through my stuff.
And he buys a piece of art that I made.
And it turns out he's alone in town for the night, driving cross-country on a road trip before he goes into the Peace Corps.
So I invite him out for a beer and he tells me all about his passion for making a difference in the world.
Now it's starting to get late, and I'm getting pretty tired.
As I motion for the tab, I make the mistake of asking him, "So where are you staying tonight?"
And he makes it worse by saying, "Actually, I don't have a place."
And I'm thinking, "Oh, man!"
What do you do?
We've all been there, right?
Do I offer to host this guy?
But, I just met him -- I mean, he says he's going to the Peace Corps, but I don't really know if he's going to the Peace Corps and I don't want to end up kidnapped in the trunk of a Miata.
That's a small trunk!
So then I hear myself saying, "Hey, I have an airbed you can stay on in my living room."
And the voice in my head goes, "Wait, what?"
That night, I'm laying in bed, I'm staring at the ceiling and thinking, "Oh my god, what have I done?
There's a complete stranger sleeping in my living room.
What if he's psychotic?"
My anxiety grows so much, I leap out of bed, I sneak on my tiptoes to the door, and I lock the bedroom door.
It turns out he was not psychotic.
We've kept in touch ever since.
And the piece of art he bought at the yard sale is hanging in his classroom; he's a teacher now.
This was my first hosting experience, and it completely changed my perspective.
Maybe the people that my childhood taught me to label as strangers were actually friends waiting to be discovered.
The idea of hosting people on airbeds gradually became natural to me and when I moved to San Francisco, I brought the airbed with me.
So now it's two years later.
I'm unemployed, I'm almost broke, my roommate moves out, and then the rent goes up.
And then I learn there's a design conference coming to town, and all the hotels are sold out.
And I've always believed that turning fear into fun is the gift of creativity.
So here's what I pitch my best friend and my new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, thought of a way to make a few bucks -- turning our place into 'designers bed and breakfast,' offering young designers who come to town a place to crash, complete with wireless Internet, a small desk space, sleeping mat, and breakfast each morning.
Ha!"
We built a basic website and Airbed and Breakfast was born.
Three lucky guests got to stay on a 20-dollar airbed on the hardwood floor.
But they loved it, and so did we.
I swear, the ham and Swiss cheese omelets we made tasted totally different because we made them for our guests.
We took them on adventures around the city, and when we said goodbye to the last guest, the door latch clicked, Brian and I just stared at each other.
Did we just discover it was possible to make friends while also making rent?
The wheels had started to turn.
My old roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined as engineering co-founder.
And we buckled down to see if we could turn this into a business.
Here's what we pitched investors: "We want to build a website where people publicly post pictures of their most intimate spaces, their bedrooms, the bathrooms -- the kinds of rooms you usually keep closed when people come over.
And then, over the Internet, they're going to invite complete strangers to come sleep in their homes.
It's going to be huge!"
(Laughter) We sat back, and we waited for the rocket ship to blast off.
It did not.
No one in their right minds would invest in a service that allows strangers to sleep in people's homes.
Why?
Because we've all been taught as kids, strangers equal danger.
Now, when you're faced with a problem, you fall back on what you know, and all we really knew was design.
In art school, you learn that design is much more than the look and feel of something -- it's the whole experience.
We learned to do that for objects, but here, we were aiming to build Olympic trust between people who had never met.
Could design make that happen?
Is it possible to design for trust?
I want to give you a sense of the flavor of trust that we were aiming to achieve.
I've got a 30-second experiment that will push you past your comfort zone.
If you're up for it, give me a thumbs-up.
OK, I need you to take out your phones.
Now that you have your phone out, I'd like you to unlock your phone.
Now hand your unlocked phone to the person on your left.
(Laughter) That tiny sense of panic you're feeling right now -- (Laughter) is exactly how hosts feel the first time they open their home.
Because the only thing more personal than your phone is your home.
People don't just see your messages, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.
Now, how does it feel holding someone's unlocked phone?
Most of us feel really responsible.
That's how most guests feel when they stay in a home.
And it's because of this that our company can even exist.
By the way, who's holding Al Gore's phone?
(Laughter) Would you tell Twitter he's running for President?
(Laughter) (Applause) OK, you can hand your phones back now.
So now that you've experienced the kind of trust challenge we were facing, I'd love to share a few discoveries we've made along the way.
What if we changed one small thing about the design of that experiment?
What if your neighbor had introduced themselves first, with their name, where they're from, the name of their kids or their dog?
Imagine that they had 150 reviews of people saying, "They're great at holding unlocked phones!"
(Laughter) Now how would you feel about handing your phone over?
It turns out, a well-designed reputation system is key for building trust.
And we didn't actually get it right the first time.
It's hard for people to leave bad reviews.
Eventually, we learned to wait until both guests and hosts left the review before we reveal them.
Now, here's a discovery we made just last week.
We did a joint study with Stanford, where we looked at people's willingness to trust someone based on how similar they are in age, location and geography.
The research showed, not surprisingly, we prefer people who are like us.
The more different somebody is, the less we trust them.
Now, that's a natural social bias.
But what's interesting is what happens when you add reputation into the mix, in this case, with reviews.
Now, if you've got less than three reviews, nothing changes.
But if you've got more than 10, everything changes.
High reputation beats high similarity.
The right design can actually help us overcome one of our most deeply rooted biases.
Now we also learned that building the right amount of trust takes the right amount of disclosure.
This is what happens when a guest first messages a host.
If you share too little, like, "Yo," acceptance rates go down.
And if you share too much, like, "I'm having issues with my mother," (Laughter) acceptance rates also go down.
But there's a zone that's just right, like, "Love the artwork in your place. Coming for vacation with my family."
So how do we design for just the right amount of disclosure?
We use the size of the box to suggest the right length, and we guide them with prompts to encourage sharing.
We bet our whole company on the hope that, with the right design, people would be willing to overcome the stranger-danger bias.
What we didn't realize is just how many people were ready and waiting to put the bias aside.
This is a graph that shows our rate of adoption.
There's three things happening here.
The first, an unbelievable amount of luck.
The second is the efforts of our team.
And third is the existence of a previously unsatisfied need.
Now, things have been going pretty well.
Obviously, there are times when things don't work out.
Guests have thrown unauthorized parties and trashed homes.
Hosts have left guests stranded in the rain.
In the early days, I was customer service, and those calls came right to my cell phone.
I was at the front lines of trust breaking.
And there's nothing worse than those calls, it hurts to even think about them.
And the disappointment in the sound of someone's voice was and, I would say, still is our single greatest motivator to keep improving.
Thankfully, out of the 123 million nights we've ever hosted, less than a fraction of a percent have been problematic.
Turns out, people are justified in their trust.
And when trust works out right, it can be absolutely magical.
We had a guest stay with a host in Uruguay, and he suffered a heart attack.
The host rushed him to the hospital.
They donated their own blood for his operation.
Let me read you his review.
(Laughter) "Excellent house for sedentary travelers prone to myocardial infarctions.
(Laughter) The area is beautiful and has direct access to the best hospitals.
(Laughter) Javier and Alejandra instantly become guardian angels who will save your life without even knowing you.
They will rush you to the hospital in their own car while you're dying and stay in the waiting room while the doctors give you a bypass.
They don't want you to feel lonely, they bring you books to read.
And they let you stay at their house extra nights without charging you.
Highly recommended!"
(Applause) Of course, not every stay is like that.
But this connection beyond the transaction is exactly what the sharing economy is aiming for.
Now, when I heard that term, I have to admit, it tripped me up.
How do sharing and transactions go together?
So let's be clear; it is about commerce.
But if you just called it the rental economy, it would be incomplete.
The sharing economy is commerce with the promise of human connection.
People share a part of themselves, and that changes everything.
You know how most travel today is, like, I think of it like fast food -- it's efficient and consistent, at the cost of local and authentic.
What if travel were like a magnificent buffet of local experiences?
What if anywhere you visited, there was a central marketplace of locals offering to get you thoroughly drunk on a pub crawl in neighborhoods you didn't even know existed.
Or learning to cook from the chef of a five-star restaurant?
Today, homes are designed around the idea of privacy and separation.
What if homes were designed to be shared from the ground up?
What would that look like?
What if cities embraced a culture of sharing?
I see a future of shared cities that bring us community and connection instead of isolation and separation.
In South Korea, in the city of Seoul, they've actually even started this.
They've repurposed hundreds of government parking spots to be shared by residents.
They're connecting students who need a place to live with empty-nesters who have extra rooms.
And they've started an incubator to help fund the next generation of sharing economy start-ups.
Tonight, just on our service, 785,000 people in 191 countries will either stay in a stranger's home or welcome one into theirs.
Clearly, it's not as crazy as we were taught.
We didn't invent anything new.
Hospitality has been around forever.
There's been many other websites like ours.
So, why did ours eventually take off?
Luck and timing aside, I've learned that you can take the components of trust, and you can design for that.
Design can overcome our most deeply rooted stranger-danger bias.
And that's amazing to me.
It blows my mind.
I think about this every time I see a red Miata go by.
Now, we know design won't solve all the world's problems.
But if it can help out with this one, if it can make a dent in this, it makes me wonder, what else can we design for next?
Thank you.
(Applause)
The evolutionary tango of animal genitalia.
Can you guess what you're looking at?
If you answered "duck vagina," you'd be right.
Although the bird's outward appearance may not strike you as especially odd, it uses this strange, intricate, cork-screw shaped contraption to reproduce.
We see similarly unbelievable genitalia in insects, mammals, reptiles, fish, spiders, and even snails.
Apparently, no organs evolve faster and into more variable shapes than those involved in procreation.
Superficially, it makes sense because evolution works via reproduction.
When an animal leaves more offspring, its genes will spread.
And since genitalia are an animal's tools for reproduction, any improvement there will have immediate effect.
And yet, what's the point of having such decorative nether regions?
After all, the function of genitalia seems simple.
A penis deposits a bit of sperm and a vagina receives it and delivers it to the egg.
A pipette-like thingy on the male and a funnel-like gizmo on the female should do just fine for any animal.
And yet, that's not what we see.
The penis of a chicken flea, for example, looks nothing like a pipette, more like an exploded grandfather clock.
And the vagina of a featherwing beetle resembles something you'd find in a Dr. Seuss book.
Throughout the animal kingdom, genitalia are very complex things, much more complicated than seems necessary for what they're meant to do.
That's because genitalia do more than just deposit and receive sperm.
Many male animals also use the penis as courtship device, like crane flies.
In some South American species, males have a tiny washboard and scraper on their penis, which produces a song that reverberates throughout the female's body when they mate.
It's thought that if female crane flies enjoy this unusual serenade, they'll allow the male to father their offspring.
This way, the genes of the most musical penises spread, leading to rapid evolution of insects' phalluses.
Similarly, some beetles have two little drumsticks on either side of the penis.
During mating, they'll rub, slap, or tap the female with these.
And some hoofed mammals, like rams and bulls, use a whip-like extension on the penis's left side to create a sensation during mating.
But how can females really choose between males if she can only assess them after mating?
This is where the power of female adaptation comes into play.
In fact, insemination is different to conception, and the female genitalia exploit this distinction.
For instance, in some dung flies, the vagina contains pockets for separating sperm from different males depending on how appealing they were.
Males using their penises for courtship and females controlling their own sperm management are two reasons why genitalia evolve into such complex shapes.
But there are others because genitalia are also where a sexual conflict is played out.
A female's interests are best served if she fertilizes her eggs with the sperm of the best fathers and creates genetic variability amongst her offspring.
For a male, on the other hand, this is bad news.
For him, it would be best if a female used his sperm to fertilize all of her eggs.
So we see cycles of adaptation in an evolutionary arms race to retain control.
Black widow spiders have a disposable penis tip that breaks off inside the vagina blocking the attempts of his rivals, and bed bug males bypass a female's genitalia altogether using a syringe-like penis to inject sperm cells directly into her belly.
Not to be outdone, females have evolved their own countermeasures.
In some bed bug species, the females have evolved an entirely new set of genitalia on their right hand flanks where the males usually pierce them.
That allows them to maintain the power to filter out unwanted sperm with their genitalia.
And duck vaginas are shaped like a clockwise spiral so that when the male inflates his long, counterclockwise coiled penis into her, and she disapproves, all she needs to do is flex her vaginal muscles and the penis just flubs out.
So, genitalia differs so much, not just to fascinate us, but because in every species, they're the result of a furious evolutionary tango of sex that has been going on for millions of years and will continue for millions of years to come.
In 1796, Thomas Jefferson received a box of bones he couldn't identify.
A long, sharp claw reminded him of a lion, but the arm bones suggested a larger animal, one about three meters long.
Thinking it might be huge unknown species of North American lion, Jefferson warned explorers Lewis and Clark to keep an eye out for this mysterious predator.
But Jefferson's box of bones didn't come from a lion.
They came from an extinct giant sloth.
Prehistoric ground sloths first appeared around 35 million years ago.
Dozens of species lived across North, Central and South America, alongside other ancient creatures like mastodons and giant armadillos.
Some ground sloths, like the megalonychid, were cat-sized, but many were massive.
Jefferson's sloth, Megalonyx, weighed about a ton, and that was small compared to megatherium, which could reach six metric tons, as much as an elephant.
They ambled through the forests and savannas using their strong arms and sharp claws to uproot plants and climb trees, grazing on grasses, leaves, and prehistoric avocados.
In fact, we might not have avocados today if not for the giant sloths.
Smaller animals couldn't swallow the avocado's huge seed, but the sloths could, and they spread avocado trees far and wide.
Ground sloths flourished for millions of years, but around 10,000 years ago, they started disappearing along with the Western Hemisphere's other giant mammals.
Researchers think that ground sloths could have been pushed out by an oncoming ice age, or competition with other species, maybe humans, who arrived in the region around the time most of the sloths went extinct.
Some of the smaller sloths did survive and migrated to the treetops.
Today, there are six species left living in the rainforest canopies of Central and South America.
Hanging out in the trees is a good way to avoid predators, and there are plenty of leaves to eat.
But this diet has its drawbacks.
Animals extract energy from food and use that energy to move around, maintain their body temperature, keep their organs working, and all the other activities necessary for survival.
But leaves don't contain much energy, and that which they do have is tough to extract.
Most herbivores supplement a leafy diet with higher energy foods like fruit and seeds.
But sloths, especially three-toed sloths, rely on leaves almost exclusively.
They've evolved finely tuned strategies for coping with this restricted diet.
First, they extract as much energy from their food as possible.
Sloths have a multi-chambered stomach that takes up a third of their body, and depending on the species, they can spend five to seven days, or even weeks, processing a meal.
The other piece of the puzzle is to use as little energy as possible.
One way sloths do this is, of course, by not moving very much.
They spend most of their time eating, resting, or sleeping.
They descend from the canopy just once a week for a bathroom break.
When sloths do move, it's not very fast.
It would take a sloth about five minutes to cross an average neighborhood street.
This unhurried approach to life means that sloths don't need very much muscle.
In fact, they have about 30% less muscle mass than other animals their size.
Sloths also use less energy to keep themselves warm because their body temperature can fluctuate by about five degrees Celsius, less than a cold-blooded reptile, but more than most mammals.
These physical and behavioral adaptations minimize the sloth's energy expenditure, or metabolic rate.
Three-toed sloths have the slowest metabolism of any mammal.
The giant panda is second slowest, and two-toed sloths come in third.
Moving slowly has allowed sloths to thrive in their treetop habitat.
But it's also made the sloths themselves a great habitat for other organisms, including algae, which provides a little extra camouflage, and maybe even a snack.
Sloths may not be giant anymore, but that doesn't make them any less remarkable.
It's a good day to be a pirate.
Amaro and his four mateys, Bart, Charlotte, Daniel, and Eliza have struck gold: a chest with 100 coins.
But now, they must divvy up the booty according to the pirate code.
As captain, Amaro gets to propose how to distribute the coins.
Then, each pirate, including Amaro himself, gets to vote either yarr or nay.
If the vote passes, or if there's a tie, the coins are divided according to plan.
But if the majority votes nay, Amaro must walk the plank and Bart becomes captain.
Then, Bart gets to propose a new distribution and all remaining pirates vote again.
If his plan is rejected, he walks the plank, too, and Charlotte takes his place.
This process repeats, with the captain's hat moving to Daniel and then Eliza until either a proposal is accepted or there's only one pirate left.
Naturally, each pirate wants to stay alive while getting as much gold as possible.
But being pirates, none of them trust each other, so they can't collaborate in advance.
And being blood-thirsty pirates, if anyone thinks they'll end up with the same amount of gold either way, they'll vote to make the captain walk the plank just for fun.
Finally, each pirate is excellent at logical deduction and knows that the others are, too.
What distribution should Amaro propose to make sure he lives?
Pause here if you want to figure it out for yourself!
Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If we follow our intuition, it seems like Amaro should try to bribe the other pirates with most of the gold to increase the chances of his plan being accepted.
But it turns out he can do much better than that. Why?
Like we said, the pirates all know each other to be top-notch logicians.
So when each votes, they won't just be thinking about the current proposal, but about all possible outcomes down the line.
And because the rank order is known in advance, each can accurately predict how the others would vote in any situation and adjust their own votes accordingly.
Because Eliza's last, she has the most outcomes to consider, so let's start by following her thought process.
She'd reason this out by working backwards from the last possible scenario with only her and Daniel remaining.
Daniel would obviously propose to keep all the gold and Eliza's one vote would not be enough to override him, so Eliza wants to avoid this situation at all costs.
Now we move to the previous decision point with three pirates left and Charlotte making the proposal.
Everyone knows that if she's outvoted, the decision moves to Daniel, who will then get all the gold while Eliza gets nothing.
So to secure Eliza's vote, Charlotte only needs to offer her slightly more than nothing, one coin.
Since this ensures her support, Charlotte doesn't need to offer Daniel anything at all.
What if there are four pirates?
As captain, Bart would still only need one other vote for his plan to pass.
He knows that Daniel wouldn't want the decision to pass to Charlotte, so he would offer Daniel one coin for his support with nothing for Charlotte or Eliza.
Now we're back at the initial vote with all five pirates standing.
Having considered all the other scenarios, Amaro knows that if he goes overboard, the decision comes down to Bart, which would be bad news for Charlotte and Eliza.
So he offers them one coin each, keeping 98 for himself.
Bart and Daniel vote nay, but Charlotte and Eliza grudgingly vote yarr knowing that the alternative would be worse for them.
The pirate game involves some interesting concepts from game theory.
One is the concept of common knowledge where each person is aware of what the others know and uses this to predict their reasoning.
And the final distribution is an example of a Nash equilibrium where each player knows every other players' strategy and chooses theirs accordingly.
Even though it may lead to a worse outcome for everyone than cooperating would, no individual player can benefit by changing their strategy.
So it looks like Amaro gets to keep most of the gold, and the other pirates might need to find better ways to use those impressive logic skills, like revising this absurd pirate code.
So a few years ago, I did something really brave, or some would say really stupid.
I ran for Congress.
For years, I had existed safely behind the scenes in politics as a fundraiser, as an organizer, but in my heart, I always wanted to run.
The sitting congresswoman had been in my district since 1992.
She had never lost a race, and no one had really even run against her in a Democratic primary.
But in my mind, this was my way to make a difference, to disrupt the status quo.
The polls, however, told a very different story.
My pollsters told me that I was crazy to run, that there was no way that I could win.
But I ran anyway, and in 2012, I became an upstart in a New York City congressional race.
I swore I was going to win.
I had the endorsement from the New York Daily News, the Wall Street Journal snapped pictures of me on election day, and CNBC called it one of the hottest races in the country.
I raised money from everyone I knew, including Indian aunties that were just so happy an Indian girl was running.
But on election day, the polls were right, and I only got 19 percent of the vote, and the same papers that said I was a rising political star now said I wasted 1.3 million dollars on 6,321 votes.
Don't do the math.
It was humiliating.
Now, before you get the wrong idea, this is not a talk about the importance of failure.
Nor is it about leaning in.
I tell you the story of how I ran for Congress because I was 33 years old and it was the first time in my entire life that I had done something that was truly brave, where I didn't worry about being perfect.
And I'm not alone: so many women I talk to tell me that they gravitate towards careers and professions that they know they're going to be great in, that they know they're going to be perfect in, and it's no wonder why.
Most girls are taught to avoid risk and failure.
We're taught to smile pretty, play it safe, get all A's.
Boys, on the other hand, are taught to play rough, swing high, crawl to the top of the monkey bars and then just jump off headfirst.
And by the time they're adults, whether they're negotiating a raise or even asking someone out on a date, they're habituated to take risk after risk.
They're rewarded for it.
It's often said in Silicon Valley, no one even takes you seriously unless you've had two failed start-ups.
In other words, we're raising our girls to be perfect, and we're raising our boys to be brave.
Some people worry about our federal deficit, but I, I worry about our bravery deficit.
Our economy, our society, we're just losing out because we're not raising our girls to be brave.
The bravery deficit is why women are underrepresented in STEM, in C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress, and pretty much everywhere you look.
In the 1980s, psychologist Carol Dweck looked at how bright fifth graders handled an assignment that was too difficult for them.
She found that bright girls were quick to give up.
The higher the IQ, the more likely they were to give up.
Bright boys, on the other hand, found the difficult material to be a challenge.
They found it energizing.
They were more likely to redouble their efforts.
What's going on?
Well, at the fifth grade level, girls routinely outperform boys in every subject, including math and science, so it's not a question of ability.
The difference is in how boys and girls approach a challenge.
And it doesn't just end in fifth grade.
An HP report found that men will apply for a job if they meet only 60 percent of the qualifications, but women, women will apply only if they meet 100 percent of the qualifications.
100 percent.
This study is usually invoked as evidence that, well, women need a little more confidence.
But I think it's evidence that women have been socialized to aspire to perfection, and they're overly cautious.
(Applause) And even when we're ambitious, even when we're leaning in, that socialization of perfection has caused us to take less risks in our careers.
And so those 600,000 jobs that are open right now in computing and tech, women are being left behind, and it means our economy is being left behind on all the innovation and problems women would solve if they were socialized to be brave instead of socialized to be perfect.
(Applause) So in 2012, I started a company to teach girls to code, and what I found is that by teaching them to code I had socialized them to be brave.
Coding, it's an endless process of trial and error, of trying to get the right command in the right place, with sometimes just a semicolon making the difference between success and failure.
Code breaks and then it falls apart, and it often takes many, many tries until that magical moment when what you're trying to build comes to life.
It requires perseverance.
It requires imperfection.
We immediately see in our program our girls' fear of not getting it right, of not being perfect.
Every Girls Who Code teacher tells me the same story.
During the first week, when the girls are learning how to code, a student will call her over and she'll say, "I don't know what code to write."
The teacher will look at her screen, and she'll see a blank text editor.
If she didn't know any better, she'd think that her student spent the past 20 minutes just staring at the screen.
But if she presses undo a few times, she'll see that her student wrote code and then deleted it.
She tried, she came close, but she didn't get it exactly right.
Instead of showing the progress that she made, she'd rather show nothing at all.
Perfection or bust.
It turns out that our girls are really good at coding, but it's not enough just to teach them to code.
My friend Lev Brie, who is a professor at the University of Columbia and teaches intro to Java tells me about his office hours with computer science students.
When the guys are struggling with an assignment, they'll come in and they'll say, "Professor, there's something wrong with my code."
The girls will come in and say, "Professor, there's something wrong with me."
We have to begin to undo the socialization of perfection, but we've got to combine it with building a sisterhood that lets girls know that they are not alone.
Because trying harder is not going to fix a broken system.
I can't tell you how many women tell me, "I'm afraid to raise my hand, I'm afraid to ask a question, because I don't want to be the only one who doesn't understand, the only one who is struggling.
When we teach girls to be brave and we have a supportive network cheering them on, they will build incredible things, and I see this every day.
Take, for instance, two of our high school students who built a game called Tampon Run -- yes, Tampon Run -- to fight against the menstruation taboo and sexism in gaming.
Or the Syrian refugee who dared show her love for her new country by building an app to help Americans get to the polls.
Or a 16-year-old girl who built an algorithm to help detect whether a cancer is benign or malignant in the off chance that she can save her daddy's life because he has cancer.
These are just three examples of thousands, thousands of girls who have been socialized to be imperfect, who have learned to keep trying, who have learned perseverance.
And whether they become coders or the next Hillary Clinton or Beyoncé, they will not defer their dreams.
And those dreams have never been more important for our country.
For the American economy, for any economy to grow, to truly innovate, we cannot leave behind half our population.
We have to socialize our girls to be comfortable with imperfection, and we've got to do it now.
We cannot wait for them to learn how to be brave like I did when I was 33 years old.
We have to teach them to be brave in schools and early in their careers, when it has the most potential to impact their lives and the lives of others, and we have to show them that they will be loved and accepted not for being perfect but for being courageous.
And so I need each of you to tell every young woman you know -- your sister, your niece, your employee, your colleague -- to be comfortable with imperfection, because when we teach girls to be imperfect, and we help them leverage it, we will build a movement of young women who are brave and who will build a better world for themselves and for each and every one of us.
Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Reshma, thank you.
It's such a powerful vision you have. You have a vision.
Tell me how it's going.
How many girls are involved now in your program?
Reshma Saujani: Yeah. So in 2012, we taught 20 girls.
This year we'll teach 40,000 in all 50 states.
(Applause) And that number is really powerful, because last year we only graduated 7,500 women in computer science.
Like, the problem is so bad that we can make that type of change quickly.
CA: And you're working with some of the companies in this room even, who are welcoming graduates from your program?
RS: Yeah, we have about 80 partners, from Twitter to Facebook to Adobe to IBM to Microsoft to Pixar to Disney, I mean, every single company out there.
And if you're not signed up, I'm going to find you, because we need every single tech company to embed a Girls Who Code classroom in their office.
CA: And you have some stories back from some of those companies that when you mix in more gender balance in the engineering teams, good things happen.
RS: Great things happen.
I mean, I think that it's crazy to me to think about the fact that right now 85 percent of all consumer purchases are made by women.
Women use social media at a rate of 600 percent more than men.
We own the Internet, and we should be building the companies of tomorrow.
And I think when companies have diverse teams, and they have incredible women that are part of their engineering teams, they build awesome things, and we see it every day.
CA: Reshma, you saw the reaction there. You're doing incredibly important work.
This whole community is cheering you on. More power to you. Thank you.
RS: Thank you.
(Applause)
Have you ever wondered what happens to a painkiller, like ibuprofen, after you swallow it?
Medicine that slides down your throat can help treat a headache, a sore back, or a throbbing sprained ankle.
But how does it get where it needs to go in the first place?
The answer is that it hitches a ride in your circulatory blood stream, cycling through your body in a race to do its job before it's snared by organs and molecules designed to neutralize and expel foreign substances.
This process starts in your digestive system.
Say you swallow an ibuprofen tablet for a sore ankle.
Within minutes, the tablet starts disintegrating in the acidic fluids of your stomach.
The dissolved ibuprofen travels into the small intestine and then across the intestinal wall into a network of blood vessels.
These blood vessels feed into a vein, which carries the blood, and anything in it, to the liver.
The next step is to make it through the liver.
As the blood and the drug molecules in it travel through liver blood vessels, enzymes attempt to react with the ibuprofen molecules to neutralize them.
The damaged ibuprofen molecules, called metabolites, may no longer be effective as painkillers.
At this stage, most of the ibuprofen makes it through the liver unscathed.
It continues its journey out of the liver, through veins, into the body's circulatory system.
Half an hour after you swallow the pill, some of the dose has already made it into the circulatory blood stream.
This blood loop travels through every limb and organ, including the heart, brain, kidneys, and back through the liver.
When ibuprofen molecules encounter a location where the body's pain response is in full swing, they bind to specific target molecules that are a part of that reaction.
Painkillers, like ibuprofen, block the production of compounds that help the body transmit pain signals.
As more drug molecules accumulate, the pain-cancelling affect increases, reaching a maximum within about one or two hours.
Then the body starts efficiently eliminating ibuprofen, with the blood dose decreasing by half every two hours on average.
When the ibuprofen molecules detach from their targets, the systemic blood stream carries them away again.
Back in the liver, another small fraction of the total amount of the drug gets transformed into metabolites, which are eventually filtered out by the kidneys in the urine.
The loop from liver to body to kidneys continues at a rate of about one blood cycle per minute, with a little more of the drug neutralized and filtered out in each cycle.
These basic steps are the same for any drug that you take orally, but the speed of the process and the amount of medicine that makes it into your blood stream varies based on drug, person, and how it gets into the body.
The dosing instructions on medicine labels can help, but they're averages based on a sample population that doesn't represent every consumer.
And getting the dose right is important.
If it's too low, the medicine won't do its job.
If it's too high, the drug and its metabolites can be toxic.
That's true of any drug.
One of the hardest groups of patients to get the right dosage for are children.
That's because how they process medicine changes quickly, as do their bodies.
For instance, the level of liver enzymes that neutralize medication highly fluctuates during infancy and childhood.
And that's just one of many complicating factors.
Genetics, age, diet, disease, and even pregnancy influence the body's efficiency of processing medicine.
Some day, routine DNA tests may be able to dial in the precise dose of medicine personalized to your liver efficiency and other factors, but in the meantime, your best bet is reading the label or consulting your doctor or pharmacist, and taking the recommended amounts with the recommended timing.
During a long day spent roaming the forest in search of edible grains and herbs, the weary divine farmer Shennong accidentally poisoned himself 72 times.
But before the poisons could end his life, a leaf drifted into his mouth.
He chewed on it and it revived him, and that is how we discovered tea.
Or so an ancient legend goes at least.
Tea doesn't actually cure poisonings, but the story of Shennong, the mythical Chinese inventor of agriculture, highlights tea's importance to ancient China.
Archaeological evidence suggests tea was first cultivated there as early as 6,000 years ago, or 1,500 years before the pharaohs built the Great Pyramids of Giza.
That original Chinese tea plant is the same type that's grown around the world today, yet it was originally consumed very differently.
It was eaten as a vegetable or cooked with grain porridge.
Tea only shifted from food to drink 1,500 years ago when people realized that a combination of heat and moisture could create a complex and varied taste out of the leafy green.
After hundreds of years of variations to the preparation method, the standard became to heat tea, pack it into portable cakes, grind it into powder, mix with hot water, and create a beverage called muo cha, or matcha.
Matcha became so popular that a distinct Chinese tea culture emerged.
Tea was the subject of books and poetry, the favorite drink of emperors, and a medium for artists.
They would draw extravagant pictures in the foam of the tea, very much like the espresso art you might see in coffee shops today.
In the 9th century during the Tang Dynasty, a Japanese monk brought the first tea plant to Japan.
The Japanese eventually developed their own unique rituals around tea, leading to the creation of the Japanese tea ceremony.
And in the 14th century during the Ming Dynasty, the Chinese emperor shifted the standard from tea pressed into cakes to loose leaf tea.
At that point, China still held a virtual monopoly on the world's tea trees, making tea one of three essential Chinese export goods, along with porcelain and silk.
This gave China a great deal of power and economic influence as tea drinking spread around the world.
That spread began in earnest around the early 1600s when Dutch traders brought tea to Europe in large quantities.
Many credit Queen Catherine of Braganza, a Portuguese noble woman, for making tea popular with the English aristocracy when she married King Charles II in 1661.
At the time, Great Britain was in the midst of expanding its colonial influence and becoming the new dominant world power.
And as Great Britain grew, interest in tea spread around the world.
By 1700, tea in Europe sold for ten times the price of coffee and the plant was still only grown in China.
The tea trade was so lucrative that the world's fastest sailboat, the clipper ship, was born out of intense competition between Western trading companies.
All were racing to bring their tea back to Europe first to maximize their profits.
At first, Britain paid for all this Chinese tea with silver.
When that proved too expensive, they suggested trading tea for another substance, opium.
This triggered a public health problem within China as people became addicted to the drug.
Then in 1839, a Chinese official ordered his men to destroy massive British shipments of opium as a statement against Britain's influence over China.
This act triggered the First Opium War between the two nations.
Fighting raged up and down the Chinese coast until 1842 when the defeated Qing Dynasty ceded the port of Hong Kong to the British and resumed trading on unfavorable terms.
The war weakened China's global standing for over a century.
The British East India company also wanted to be able to grow tea themselves and further control the market.
So they commissioned botanist Robert Fortune to steal tea from China in a covert operation.
He disguised himself and took a perilous journey through China's mountainous tea regions, eventually smuggling tea trees and experienced tea workers into Darjeeling, India.
From there, the plant spread further still, helping drive tea's rapid growth as an everyday commodity.
Today, tea is the second most consumed beverage in the world after water, and from sugary Turkish Rize tea, to salty Tibetan butter tea, there are almost as many ways of preparing the beverage as there are cultures on the globe.
What do fans of atmospheric post-punk music have in common with ancient barbarians?
Not much.
So why are both known as goths?
Is it a weird coincidence or a deeper connection stretching across the centuries?
The story begins in Ancient Rome.
As the Roman Empire expanded, it faced raids and invasions from the semi-nomadic populations along its borders.
Among the most powerful were a Germanic people known as Goths who were composed of two tribal groups, the Visigoths and Ostrogoths.
While some of the Germanic tribes remained Rome's enemies, the Empire incorporated others into the imperial army.
As the Roman Empire split in two, these tribal armies played larger roles in its defense and internal power struggles.
In the 5th century, a mercenary revolt lead by a soldier named Odoacer captured Rome and deposed the Western Emperor.
Odoacer and his Ostrogoth successor Theoderic technically remained under the Eastern Emperor's authority and maintained Roman traditions.
But the Western Empire would never be united again.
Its dominions fragmented into kingdoms ruled by Goths and other Germanic tribes who assimilated into local cultures, though many of their names still mark the map.
This was the end of the Classical Period and the beginning of what many call the Dark Ages.
Although Roman culture was never fully lost, its influence declined and new art styles arose focused on religious symbolism and allegory rather than proportion and realism.
This shift extended to architecture with the construction of the Abbey of Saint Denis in France in 1137.
Pointed arches, flying buttresses, and large windows made the structure more skeletal and ornate.
That emphasized its open, luminous interior rather than the sturdy walls and columns of Classical buildings.
Over the next few centuries, this became a model for Cathedrals throughout Europe.
But fashions change.
With the Italian Renaissance's renewed admiration for Ancient Greece and Rome, the more recent style began to seem crude and inferior in comparison.
Writing in his 1550 book, "Lives of the Artists," Giorgio Vasari was the first to describe it as Gothic, a derogatory reference to the Barbarians thought to have destroyed Classical civilization.
The name stuck, and soon came to describe the Medieval period overall, with its associations of darkness, superstition, and simplicity.
But time marched on, as did what was considered fashionable.
In the 1700s, a period called the Enlightenment came about, which valued scientific reason above all else.
Reacting against that, Romantic authors like Goethe and Byron sought idealized visions of a past of natural landscapes and mysterious spiritual forces.
Here, the word Gothic was repurposed again to describe a literary genre that emerged as a darker strain of Romanticism.
The term was first applied by Horace Walpole to his own 1764 novel, "The Castle of Otranto" as a reference to the plot and general atmosphere.
Many of the novel's elements became genre staples inspiring classics and the countless movies they spawned.
The gothic label belonged to literature and film until the 1970s when a new musical scene emerged.
Taking cues from artists like The Doors and The Velvet Underground, British post-punk groups, like Joy Division, Bauhaus, and The Cure, combined gloomy lyrics and punk dissonance with imagery inspired by the Victorian era, classic horror, and androgynous glam fashion.
By the early 1980s, similar bands were consistently described as Gothic rock by the music press, and the stye's popularity brought it out of dimly lit clubs to major labels and MTV.
And today, despite occasional negative media attention and stereotypes, Gothic music and fashion continue as a strong underground phenomenon.
They've also branched into sub-genres, such as cybergoth, gothabilly, gothic metal, and even steampunk.
The history of the word gothic is embedded in thousands of years worth of countercultural movements, from invading outsiders becoming kings to towering spires replacing solid columns to artists finding beauty in darkness.
Each step has seen a revolution of sorts and a tendency for civilization to reach into its past to reshape its present.
In 1898, Marie and Pierre Curie discovered radium.
Claimed to have restorative properties, radium was added to toothpaste, medicine, water, and food.
A glowing, luminous green, it was also used in beauty products and jewelry.
It wasn't until the mid-20th century we realized that radium's harmful effects as a radioactive element outweighed its visual benefits.
Unfortunately, radium isn't the only pigment that historically seemed harmless or useful but turned out to be deadly.
That lamentable distinction includes a trio of colors and pigments that we've long used to decorate ourselves and the things we make: white, green, and orange.
Our story begins with white.
As far back as the 4th century BCE, the Ancient Greeks treated lead to make the brilliant white pigment we know today.
The problem?
In humans, lead is directly absorbed into the body and distributed to the blood, soft tissues, and mineralized tissues.
Once in the nervous system, lead mimics and disrupts the normal functions of calcium, causing damages ranging from learning disabilities to high blood pressure.
Yet the practice of using this toxic pigment continued across time and cultures.
Lead white was the only practical choice for white oil or tempera paint until the 19th century.
To make their paint, artists would grind a block of lead into powder, exposing highly toxic dust particles.
The pigment's liberal use resulted in what was known as painter's colic, or what we'd now call lead poisoning.
Artists who worked with lead complained of palseys, melancholy, coughing, enlarged retinas, and even blindness.
But lead white's density, opacity, and warm tone were irresistible to artists like Vermeer, and later, the Impressionists.
Its glow couldn't be matched, and the pigment continued to be widely used until it was banned in the 1970s.
As bad as all that sounds, white's dangerous effects pale in comparison to another, more wide-spread pigment, green.
Two synthetic greens called Scheele's Green and Paris Green were first introduced in the 18th century.
They were far more vibrant and flashy than the relatively dull greens made from natural pigments, so they quickly became popular choices for paint as well as dye for textiles, wallpaper, soaps, cake decorations, toys, candy, and clothing.
These green pigments were made from a compound called cupric hydrogen arsenic.
In humans, exposure to arsenic can damage the way cells communicate and function.
And high levels of arsenic have been directly linked to cancer and heart disease.
As a result, 18th century fabric factory workers were often poisoned, and women in green dresses reportedly collapsed from exposure to arsenic on their skin.
Bed bugs were rumored not to live in green rooms, and it's even been speculated that Napoleon died from slow arsenic poisoning from sleeping in his green wallpapered bedroom.
The intense toxicity of these green stayed under wraps until the arsenic recipe was published in 1822.
And a century later, it was repurposed as an insecticide.
Synthetic green was probably the most dangerous color in widespread use, but at least it didn't share radium's property of radioactivity.
Another color did, though - orange.
Before World War II, it was common for manufacturers of ceramic dinnerware to use uranium oxide in colored glazes.
The compound produced brilliant reds and oranges, which were appealing attributes, if not for the radiation they emitted.
Of course, radiation was something we were unaware of until the late 1800s, let alone the associated cancer risks, which we discovered much later.
During World War II, the U.S. government confiscated all uranium for use in bomb development.
However, the atomic energy commission relaxed these restrictions in 1959, and depleted uranium returned to ceramics and glass factory floors.
Orange dishes made during the next decade may still have some hazardous qualities on their surfaces to this day.
Most notably, vintage fiestaware reads positive for radioactivity.
And while the levels are low enough that they don't officially pose a health risk if they're on a shelf, the U.S. EPA warns against eating food off of them.
Though we still occasionally run into issues with synthetic food dyes, our scientific understanding has helped us prune hazardous colors out of our lives.
Deep inside Yale University's Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library lies the only copy of a 240-page tome.
Recently carbon dated to around 1420, its vellum pages features looping handwriting and hand-drawn images seemingly stolen from a dream.
Real and imaginary plants, floating castles, bathing women, astrology diagrams, zodiac rings, and suns and moons with faces accompany the text.
This 24x16 centimeter book is called the Voynich manuscript, and its one of history's biggest unsolved mysteries.
The reason why?
No one can figure out what it says.
The name comes from Wilfrid Voynich, a Polish bookseller who came across the document at a Jesuit college in Italy in 1912.
He was puzzled.
Who wrote it?
Where was it made?
What do these bizarre words and vibrant drawings represent?
What secrets do its pages contain?
He purchased the manuscript from the cash-strapped priest at the college, and eventually brought it to the U.S., where experts have continued to puzzle over it for more than a century.
Cryptologists say the writing has all the characteristics of a real language, just one that no one's ever seen before.
What makes it seem real is that in actual languages, letters and groups of letters appear with consistent frequencies, and the language in the Voynich manuscript has patterns you wouldn't find from a random letter generator.
Other than that, we know little more than what we can see.
The letters are varied in style and height.
Some are borrowed from other scripts, but many are unique.
The taller letters have been named gallows characters.
The manuscript is highly decorated throughout with scroll-like embellishments.
It appears to be written by two or more hands, with the painting done by yet another party.
Over the years, three main theories about the manuscript's text have emerged.
The first is that it's written in cypher, a secret code deliberately designed to hide secret meaning.
The second is that the document is a hoax written in gibberish to make money off a gullible buyer.
Some speculate the author was a medieval con man.
Others, that it was Voynich himself.
The third theory is that the manuscript is written in an actual language, but in an unknown script.
Perhaps medieval scholars were attempting to create an alphabet for a language that was spoken but not yet written.
In that case, the Voynich manuscript might be like the rongorongo script invented on Easter Island, now unreadable after the culture that made it collapsed.
Though no one can read the Voynich manuscript, that hasn't stopped people from guessing what it might say.
Those who believe the manuscript was an attempt to create a new form of written language speculate that it might be an encyclopedia containing the knowledge of the culture that produced it.
Others believe it was written by the 13th century philosopher Roger Bacon, who attempted to understand the universal laws of grammar, or in the 16th century by the Elizabethan mystic John Dee, who practiced alchemy and divination.
More fringe theories that the book was written by a coven of Italian witches, or even by Martians.
After 100 years of frustration, scientists have recently shed a little light on the mystery.
The first breakthrough was the carbon dating.
Also, contemporary historians have traced the provenance of the manuscript back through Rome and Prague to as early as 1612, when it was perhaps passed from Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II to his physician, Jacobus Sinapius.
In addition to these historical breakthroughs, linguistic researchers recently proposed the provisional identification of a few of the manuscript's words.
Could the letters beside these seven stars spell Tauran, a name for Taurus, a constellation that includes the seven stars called the Pleiades?
Could this word be Centaurun for the Centaurea plant in the picture?
Perhaps, but progress is slow.
If we can crack its code, what might we find?
The dream journal of a 15th-century illustrator?
A bunch of nonsense?
Or the lost knowledge of a forgotten culture?
What do you think it is?
A lone priestess walks towards an underground chamber.
People line the streets to watch as she proclaims her innocence.
It doesn't matter.
She's already been judged and found guilty.
The sentence?
Live burial.
The underground chamber contains a portion of bread, water, milk, and oil.
She will have a lamp, a bed, and a blanket, but she won't emerge alive.
At the threshold, the priestess pauses, claims her innocence one last time, then enters the chamber never to be seen again by the Roman people.
The priestess is one of Rome's six Vestal Virgins, each carefully selected as children from Rome's most aristocratic families.
But now with her death, there are only five, and a new priestess must be chosen.
The six-year-old Licinia witnessed the spectacle, never suspecting that a few days later, she'd be chosen as the next Vestal Virgin.
Her age, her patrician family lineage, and her apparent good health makes her the best candidate to serve the goddess Vesta in the eyes of the Romans.
Her parents are proud that their daughter's been chosen.
Licinia is afraid, but she has no choice in the matter.
She must serve the goddess for at least the next 30 years.
For the first ten years of Licinia's service, she's considered in training, learning how to be a Vestal Virgin.
Her most important duty is keeping vigil over the flame of Vesta, the virgin goddess of the hearth.
Vesta doesn't have a statue like other Roman gods and goddesses.
Instead, she's represented by the flame which burns day and night in her temple located next to the Forum in the center of the city.
Like all Vestal priestesses, Licinia spends part of each day on shift, watching and tending to the flame.
The flame represents two things.
The first is the continuation of Rome as a power in the world.
The Romans believed that if the flame goes out, the city's in danger.
The flame also symbolizes the continuing virginity of Vesta's priestesses.
For the Romans, a Vestal's virginity signaled not only her castitas, or modest spirit and body, but also her ritual purity.
So Licinia knows she must never let the flame go out.
Her life, the lives of her fellow Vestals, and the safety of Rome itself depends upon it.
Licinia learns to collect water each day from a nearby fountain to cleanse the temple.
She learns the Fasti, the calendar of sacred rituals and she watches while the senior priestesses conduct sacrifices.
By the time Licinia completes her training, she's 16 years old.
Licinia understands that the way she must act is a reflection of the goddess she serves.
When it's her turn to collect the water, she keeps her eyes lowered to the ground.
When she performs sacrifices, she focuses intently on the task.
Licinia directs her energy towards being the best priestess she can be.
She's worried that someday the state will claim her life for its own purposes to protect itself from danger.
Licinia could be accused of incestum, meaning unchastity, at any time and be sacrificed whether she's innocent or guilty.
Licinia fully understands now why her predecessor was buried alive.
Ten years ago, the flame of Vesta went out.
The priestesses knew that they couldn't keep it a secret.
The future of Rome depended upon it.
They went to the chief priest and he opened an investigation to discover why the flame had failed.
Someone came forward and claimed that one of the Vestals was no longer a virgin.
That was the beginning of the end.
The accused protested her innocence, but it wasn't enough.
She was tried and found guilty.
That Vestal's death was meant to protect the city, but Licinia weeps for what has been lost and for what she knows now.
Her own path was paved by the death of another, and her life could be taken just as easily for something as simple as a flame going out.
Around 1159 A.D., a mathematician called Bhaskara the Learned sketched a design for a wheel containing curved reservoirs of mercury.
He reasoned that as the wheels spun, the mercury would flow to the bottom of each reservoir, leaving one side of the wheel perpetually heavier than the other.
The imbalance would keep the wheel turning forever.
Bhaskara's drawing was one of the earliest designs for a perpetual motion machine, a device that can do work indefinitely without any external energy source.
Imagine a windmill that produced the breeze it needed to keep rotating.
Or a lightbulb whose glow provided its own electricity.
These devices have captured many inventors' imaginations because they could transform our relationship with energy.
For example, if you could build a perpetual motion machine that included humans as part of its perfectly efficient system, it could sustain life indefinitely.
There's just one problem.
They don't work.
Ideas for perpetual motion machines all violate one or more fundamental laws of thermodynamics, the branch of physics that describes the relationship between different forms of energy.
The first law of thermodynamics says that energy can't be created or destroyed.
You can't get out more energy than you put in.
That rules out a useful perpetual motion machine right away because a machine could only ever produce as much energy as it consumed.
There wouldn't be any left over to power a car or charge a phone.
But what if you just wanted the machine to keep itself moving?
Inventors have proposed plenty of ideas.
Several of these have been variations on Bhaskara's over-balanced wheel with rolling balls or weights on swinging arms.
None of them work.
The moving parts that make one side of the wheel heavier also shift its center of mass downward below the axle.
With a low center of mass, the wheel just swings back and forth like a pendulum, then stops.
What about a different approach?
In the 17th century, Robert Boyle came up with an idea for a self-watering pot.
He theorized that capillary action, the attraction between liquids and surfaces that pulls water through thin tubes, might keep the water cycling around the bowl.
But if the capillary action is strong enough to overcome gravity and draw the water up, it would also prevent it from falling back into the bowl.
Then there are versions with magnets, like this set of ramps.
The ball is supposed to be pulled upwards by the magnet at the top, fall back down through the hole, and repeat the cycle.
This one fails because like the self-watering pot, the magnet would simply hold the ball at the top.
Even if it somehow did keep moving, the magnet's strength would degrade over time and eventually stop working.
For each of these machines to keep moving, they'd have to create some extra energy to nudge the system past its stopping point, breaking the first law of thermodynamics.
There are ones that seem to keep going, but in reality, they invariably turn out to be drawing energy from some external source.
Even if engineers could somehow design a machine that didn't violate the first law of thermodynamics, it still wouldn't work in the real world because of the second law.
The second law of thermodynamics tells us that energy tends to spread out through processes like friction.
Any real machine would have moving parts or interactions with air or liquid molecules that would generate tiny amounts of friction and heat, even in a vacuum.
That heat is energy escaping, and it would keep leeching out, reducing the energy available to move the system itself until the machine inevitably stopped.
So far, these two laws of thermodynamics have stymied every idea for perpetual motion and the dreams of perfectly efficient energy generation they imply.
Yet it's hard to conclusively say we'll never discover a perpetual motion machine because there's still so much we don't understand about the universe.
Perhaps we'll find new exotic forms of matter that'll force us to revisit the laws of thermodynamics.
Or maybe there's perpetual motion on tiny quantum scales.
What we can be reasonably sure about is that we'll never stop looking.
For now, the one thing that seems truly perpetual is our search.
There are times when I feel really quite ashamed to be a European.
In the last year, more than a million people arrived in Europe in need of our help, and our response, frankly, has been pathetic.
There are just so many contradictions.
We mourn the tragic death of two-year-old Alan Kurdi, and yet, since then, more than 200 children have subsequently drowned in the Mediterranean.
We have international treaties that recognize that refugees are a shared responsibility, and yet we accept that tiny Lebanon hosts more Syrians than the whole of Europe combined.
We lament the existence of human smugglers, and yet we make that the only viable route to seek asylum in Europe.
We have labor shortages, and yet we exclude people who fit our economic and demographic needs from coming to Europe.
We proclaim our liberal values in opposition to fundamentalist Islam, and yet -- we have repressive policies that detain child asylum seekers, that separate children from their families, and that seize property from refugees.
What are we doing?
How has the situation come to this, that we've adopted such an inhumane response to a humanitarian crisis?
I don't believe it's because people don't care, or at least I don't want to believe it's because people don't care.
I believe it's because our politicians lack a vision, a vision for how to adapt an international refugee system created over 50 years ago for a changing and globalized world.
And so what I want to do is take a step back and ask two really fundamental questions, the two questions we all need to ask.
First, why is the current system not working?
And second, what can we do to fix it?
So the modern refugee regime was created in the aftermath of the Second World War by these guys.
Its basic aim is to ensure that when a state fails, or worse, turns against its own people, people have somewhere to go, to live in safety and dignity until they can go home.
It was created precisely for situations like the situation we see in Syria today.
Through an international convention signed by 147 governments, the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees, and an international organization, UNHCR, states committed to reciprocally admit people onto their territory who flee conflict and persecution.
But today, that system is failing.
In theory, refugees have a right to seek asylum.
In practice, our immigration policies block the path to safety.
In theory, refugees have a right to a pathway to integration, or return to the country they've come from.
But in practice, they get stuck in almost indefinite limbo.
In theory, refugees are a shared global responsibility.
In practice, geography means that countries proximate the conflict take the overwhelming majority of the world's refugees.
The system isn't broken because the rules are wrong.
It's that we're not applying them adequately to a changing world, and that's what we need to reconsider.
So I want to explain to you a little bit about how the current system works.
How does the refugee regime actually work?
But not from a top-down institutional perspective, rather from the perspective of a refugee.
So imagine a Syrian woman.
Let's call her Amira.
And Amira to me represents many of the people I've met in the region.
Amira, like around 25 percent of the world's refugees, is a woman with children, and she can't go home because she comes from this city that you see before you, Homs, a once beautiful and historic city now under rubble.
And so Amira can't go back there.
But Amira also has no hope of resettlement to a third country, because that's a lottery ticket only available to less than one percent of the world's refugees.
So Amira and her family face an almost impossible choice.
They have three basic options.
The first option is that Amira can take her family to a camp.
In the camp, she might get assistance, but there are very few prospects for Amira and her family.
Camps are in bleak, arid locations, often in the desert.
In the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, you can hear the shells across the border in Syria at nighttime.
There's restricted economic activity.
Education is often of poor quality.
And around the world, some 80 percent of refugees who are in camps have to stay for at least five years.
It's a miserable existence, and that's probably why, in reality, only nine percent of Syrians choose that option.
Alternatively, Amira can head to an urban area in a neighboring country, like Amman or Beirut.
That's an option that about 75 percent of Syrian refugees have taken.
But there, there's great difficulty as well.
Refugees in such urban areas don't usually have the right to work.
They don't usually get significant access to assistance.
And so when Amira and her family have used up their basic savings, they're left with very little and likely to face urban destitution.
So there's a third alternative, and it's one that increasing numbers of Syrians are taking.
Amira can seek some hope for her family by risking their lives on a dangerous and perilous journey to another country, and it's that which we're seeing in Europe today.
Around the world, we present refugees with an almost impossible choice between three options: encampment, urban destitution and dangerous journeys.
For refugees, that choice is the global refugee regime today.
But I think it's a false choice.
I think we can reconsider that choice.
The reason why we limit those options is because we think that those are the only options that are available to refugees, and they're not.
Politicians frame the issue as a zero-sum issue, that if we benefit refugees, we're imposing costs on citizens.
We tend to have a collective assumption that refugees are an inevitable cost or burden to society.
But they don't have to. They can contribute.
So what I want to argue is there are ways in which we can expand that choice set and still benefit everyone else: the host states and communities, our societies and refugees themselves.
And I want to suggest four ways we can transform the paradigm of how we think about refugees.
All four ways have one thing in common: they're all ways in which we take the opportunities of globalization, mobility and markets, and update the way we think about the refugee issue.
The first one I want to think about is the idea of enabling environments, and it starts from a very basic recognition that refugees are human beings like everyone else, but they're just in extraordinary circumstances.
Together with my colleagues in Oxford, we've embarked on a research project in Uganda looking at the economic lives of refugees.
We chose Uganda not because it's representative of all host countries.
It's not. It's exceptional.
Unlike most host countries around the world, what Uganda has done is give refugees economic opportunity.
It gives them the right to work. It gives them freedom of movement.
And the results of that are extraordinary both for refugees and the host community.
In the capital city, Kampala, we found that 21 percent of refugees own a business that employs other people, and 40 percent of those employees are nationals of the host country.
In other words, refugees are making jobs for citizens of the host country.
Even in the camps, we found extraordinary examples of vibrant, flourishing and entrepreneurial businesses.
For example, in a settlement called Nakivale, we found examples of Congolese refugees running digital music exchange businesses.
We found a Rwandan who runs a business that's available to allow the youth to play computer games on recycled games consoles and recycled televisions.
Against the odds of extreme constraint, refugees are innovating, and the gentleman you see before you is a Congolese guy called Demou-Kay.
Demou-Kay arrived in the settlement with very little, but he wanted to be a filmmaker.
So with friends and colleagues, he started a community radio station, he rented a video camera, and he's now making films.
He made two documentary films with and for our team, and he's making a successful business out of very little.
It's those kinds of examples that should guide our response to refugees.
Rather than seeing refugees as inevitably dependent upon humanitarian assistance, we need to provide them with opportunities for human flourishing.
Yes, clothes, blankets, shelter, food are all important in the emergency phase, but we need to also look beyond that.
We need to provide opportunities to connectivity, electricity, education, the right to work, access to capital and banking.
All the ways in which we take for granted that we are plugged in to the global economy can and should apply to refugees.
The second idea I want to discuss is economic zones.
Unfortunately, not every host country in the world takes the approach Uganda has taken.
Most host countries don't open up their economies to refugees in the same way.
But there are still pragmatic alternative options that we can use.
Last April, I traveled to Jordan with my colleague, the development economist Paul Collier, and we brainstormed an idea while we were there with the international community and the government, an idea to bring jobs to Syrians while supporting Jordan's national development strategy.
The idea is for an economic zone, one in which we could potentially integrate the employment of refugees alongside the employment of Jordanian host nationals.
And just 15 minutes away from the Zaatari refugee camp, home to 83,000 refugees, is an existing economic zone called the King Hussein Bin Talal Development Area.
The government has spent over a hundred million dollars connecting it to the electricity grid, connecting it to the road network, but it lacked two things: access to labor and inward investment.
So what if refugees were able to work there rather than being stuck in camps, able to support their families and develop skills through vocational training before they go back to Syria?
We recognized that that could benefit Jordan, whose development strategy requires it to make the leap as a middle income country to manufacturing.
It could benefit refugees, but it could also contribute to the postconflict reconstruction of Syria by recognizing that we need to incubate refugees as the best source of eventually rebuilding Syria.
We published the idea in the journal Foreign Affairs.
King Abdullah has picked up on the idea.
It was announced at the London Syria Conference two weeks ago, and a pilot will begin in the summer.
(Applause) The third idea that I want to put to you is preference matching between states and refugees to lead to the kinds of happy outcomes you see here in the selfie featuring Angela Merkel and a Syrian refugee.
What we rarely do is ask refugees what they want, where they want to go, but I'd argue we can do that and still make everyone better off.
The economist Alvin Roth has developed the idea of matching markets, ways in which the preference ranking of the parties shapes an eventual match.
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Teytelboym have explored ways in which that idea could be applied to refugees, to ask refugees to rank their preferred destinations, but also allow states to rank the types of refugees they want on skills criteria or language criteria and allow those to match.
Now, of course you'd need to build in quotas on things like diversity and vulnerability, but it's a way of increasing the possibilities of matching.
The matching idea has been successfully used to match, for instance, students with university places, to match kidney donors with patients, and it underlies the kind of algorithms that exist on dating websites.
So why not apply that to give refugees greater choice?
It could also be used at the national level, where one of the great challenges we face is to persuade local communities to accept refugees.
And at the moment, in my country, for instance, we often send engineers to rural areas and farmers to the cities, which makes no sense at all.
So matching markets offer a potential way to bring those preferences together and listen to the needs and demands of the populations that host and the refugees themselves.
The fourth idea I want to put to you is of humanitarian visas.
Much of the tragedy and chaos we've seen in Europe was entirely avoidable.
It stems from a fundamental contradiction in Europe's asylum policy, which is the following: that in order to seek asylum in Europe, you have to arrive spontaneously by embarking on those dangerous journeys that I described.
But why should those journeys be necessary in an era of the budget airline and modern consular capabilities?
They're completely unnecessary journeys, and last year, they led to the deaths of over 3,000 people on Europe's borders and within European territory.
If refugees were simply allowed to travel directly and seek asylum in Europe, we would avoid that, and there's a way of doing that through something called a humanitarian visa, that allows people to collect a visa at an embassy or a consulate in a neighboring country and then simply pay their own way through a ferry or a flight to Europe.
It costs around a thousand euros to take a smuggler from Turkey to the Greek islands.
It costs 200 euros to take a budget airline from Bodrum to Frankfurt.
If we allowed refugees to do that, it would have major advantages.
It would save lives, it would undercut the entire market for smugglers, and it would remove the chaos we see from Europe's front line in areas like the Greek islands.
It's politics that prevents us doing that rather than a rational solution.
And this is an idea that has been applied.
Brazil has adopted a pioneering approach where over 2,000 Syrians have been able to get humanitarian visas, enter Brazil, and claim refugee status on arrival in Brazil.
And in that scheme, every Syrian who has gone through it has received refugee status and been recognized as a genuine refugee.
There is a historical precedent for it as well.
Between 1922 and 1942, these Nansen passports were used as travel documents to allow 450,000 Assyrians, Turks and Chechens to travel across Europe and claim refugee status elsewhere in Europe.
And the Nansen International Refugee Office received the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of this being a viable strategy.
So all four of these ideas that I've presented you are ways in which we can expand Amira's choice set.
They're ways in which we can have greater choice for refugees beyond those basic, impossible three options I explained to you and still leave others better off.
In conclusion, we really need a new vision, a vision that enlarges the choices of refugees but recognizes that they don't have to be a burden.
There's nothing inevitable about refugees being a cost.
Yes, they are a humanitarian responsibility, but they're human beings with skills, talents, aspirations, with the ability to make contributions -- if we let them.
In the new world, migration is not going to go away.
What we've seen in Europe will be with us for many years.
People will continue to travel, they'll continue to be displaced, and we need to find rational, realistic ways of managing this -- not based on the old logics of humanitarian assistance, not based on logics of charity, but building on the opportunities offered by globalization, markets and mobility.
I'd urge you all to wake up and urge our politicians to wake up to this challenge.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
If you want a glimpse of Marie Curie's manuscripts, you'll have to sign a waiver and put on protective gear to shield yourself from radiation contamination.
Madame Curie's remains, too, were interred in a lead-lined coffin, keeping the radiation that was the heart of her research, and likely the cause of her death, well contained.
Growing up in Warsaw in Russian-occupied Poland, the young Marie, originally named Maria Sklodowska, was a brilliant student, but she faced some challenging barriers.
As a woman, she was barred from pursuing higher education, so in an act of defiance, Marie enrolled in the Floating University, a secret institution that provided clandestine education to Polish youth.
By saving money and working as a governess and tutor, she eventually was able to move to Paris to study at the reputed Sorbonne.
There, Marie earned both a physics and mathematics degree surviving largely on bread and tea, and sometimes fainting from near starvation.
In Paris, Marie met the physicist Pierre Curie, who shared his lab and his heart with her.
But she longed to be back in Poland.
